{"prompt":"Teaching Your Kids to Save Money","completion":"Think about the lessons you learned about money. How do the messages you heard in your early years impact the way you view and manage money today? Research shows that lifelong money habits are formed early. In fact, psychologists believe that  by age 7  (I know, right?), kids have already developed long-lasting attitudes about money.  So how do you talk to your kids about money in a way that sets them up for financial success?  What Shaped Your Financial Attitudes?  Start by reflecting on how your childhood shaped your current financial behaviors and attitudes. How did you learn these lessons?  Many folks in our SaverLife community tell us that they remember their parents’ frugality – or their parents’ spending – and realize that they are unconsciously copying those behaviors, or consciously trying to act differently.  Model the Behaviors You Want Kids to Practice  Kids see and notice a lot, so unfortunately, the “do as I say, not as I do” strategy often falls flat. I believe that it’s not just about teaching good financial behaviors. We have to live those values we want to instill in our young people.  Here are a few questions I want you to consider:   What do your kids observe you doing or saying about money?  Are you stressed about money?  What words or phrases do you repeat often about money?  How do you think your kids interpret your messages?   Start Saving with Your Kids  If you’re able to, I think giving your kids an allowance is a good way to practice managing money. Talk to them about their goals for their money and encourage them to save up for things that matter to them – perhaps a new bike or a charitable cause they care about.  If they meet their goals, celebrate with them! You could even consider setting up a small match to reward them for saving instead of immediately spending their money. (Sound familiar? If you haven’t already,  sign up for SaverLife  so you can start earning rewards and prizes for saving.)  Involve Your Kids in Real-World Decisions  Everyday lessons are the easiest way to share your values. The next time you are shopping for groceries, think about the choices you make and describe your reasons to your children. I find that when I tell my grandchildren why I make the choices I do, they are clear about my values and how I behave with money, even when I make financial mistakes. For example, I explain to my grandchildren that I don’t buy gifts because I believe in buying experiences instead.  So, if you’re buying a car, moving to a new house, getting a pet, or paying with a credit card, involve your kids. Share your thought process to help them understand the complexities of financial decision-making.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has a great resource called  Money as You Grow  that dives deeper into important age-appropriate money conversations to have with your kids. "}

{"prompt":"What Is a Roth IRA?","completion":" A Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account) allows you to save up to a certain amount of money in a non-deductible, after-tax account. Contributions to the account are not tax-deductible, but funds grow tax-free. Any withdrawals made after age 59 ½ are tax-free. The annual contributions limit, set by the Federal government, is $6,000 for 2021 for individuals under the age of 50 and $7,000 for individuals over the age of 50.   Roth IRAs are designed for individuals who earn less than $140,000 (single) or $208,000 (married) to save for retirement. You can make contributions to the account at any age as long as you have earned income. There are no required minimum distributions as with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.  How to Open a Roth IRA  To open a Roth IRA, look for a financial institution that has received IRS approval to offer IRAs. Examples are banks, credit unions, brokerage companies, and savings and loan associations. You can establish a Roth IRA at any time. Compare fees, and specific account requirements when selecting a Roth IRA.  Can I Take Money Out of a Roth IRA?  Funds withdrawn from the Roth IRA need to be qualified distributions. If you withdraw an amount equal to the sum you deposited, the distribution is not taxable income, so it’s not subject to a penalty. If you withdraw funds before the age of 59 ½, to be considered a qualified distribution they need to be used for the purchase of a first home, distributed to the beneficiary of the Roth IRA, or the Roth IRA holder has become disabled.   The biggest advantages are no taxes on withdrawals and being able to continue contributions while earning income. "} 
{"prompt":"Ready to Start Investing? 6 Tips for Avoiding Scams","completion":"You’ve worked hard to get where you are financially, and investing might seem like the next step. But sometimes the financial landscape (and especially the internet) is like the Wild West. Let’s go through some tips to have in mind and common pitfalls to watch out for when you start investing.  Know Your “Why”  With any investment, start with your “why” – this includes specific financial goals you want to reach, the dollar amounts your goals will require, and the time horizon on which you hope to accomplish your goals.  If you’re looking to “get rich quick,” that is not a realistic or healthy goal for your investments. Likewise, if you’re seeking a “no-risk investment,” that is another red flag.  Guaranteed Rate of Return  Investing, by its very definition, involves some level of risk (although you can choose low-risk or high-risk investment options depending on your risk tolerance). If someone is offering you something with a guaranteed rate of return, that should set off all your “scam” alarm bells.  The exception is annuities; some annuities offer a guaranteed rate, but they are usually sold by a broker. Annuities are most often used to help people manage their income in retirement. If you think an annuity might be a good option for you, check out this  overview on annuities  from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Scrutinize the Bandwagon  When all of your friends and family are telling you about a “can’t lose” investment, don’t buy the hype. Feeling like everyone around you is getting in on an awesome investment opportunity can make it feel like you’re missing out, but this is actually a common sales pitch for scams.  Affinity fraud is when a scam targets members of a particular social circle, religious group, or ethnic background – so even if it seems like everyone around you is buying in to something,  do your research  and start with skepticism.  Ponzi Alert  A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment fraud where they money you’re investing does not actually go toward a real company or investment. Instead, the money you “invest” is used to pay returns to earlier investors. Ponzi schemes at some point fail to attract a steady stream of new investors, and at this point, everyone except the earliest investors will lose their money.  Did you know that Ponzi schemes are named for a real person?  Charles Ponzi  scammed investors in the 1920s with what he claimed was postage stamp speculation. Again, the SEC is a great resource to learn about  Ponzi scheme “red flags”  – these include being offered unusually high returns with very low risk.  Get an Account Statement  Your investment account statements are easy to skim and throw away, but it’s worth taking a closer look to make sure you’re clear about the details of your investments. Sometimes you  can  judge a book by its cover: if your account statement looks unprofessional or altered, this is a good tip that it may be fraudulent.  Make sure your account statement has all these  key pieces of information  and don’t be afraid to ask questions if you feel like something might be off.  Check the Source  If you’re ever suspicious or uncertain, trust your gut and do some research. Here are a few good places to start:   BrokerCheck from FINRA : Use this free online tool to research the background of financial brokers, advisers, and firms.  Certified Financial Planner : CFPs are professionals trained in financial planning who can serve as trustworthy resources in your financial life.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) : The CFPB is a U.S. government agency that works to make sure that banks, lenders, and other financial companies treat consumers fairly.   ***  All investments have some inherent risk (that’s the downside of putting money into the market). But if you stick to an investment strategy, create a diversified portfolio, and keep a keen eye out for scams, you can minimize your risk and maximize your reward. "} 
{"prompt":"How does Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) work?","completion":" Are you over the age of 60 looking for free help with your taxes? If so, consider taking advantage of an IRS program called The Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Program. This program partners with a variety of organizations, like AARP, to offer free tax assistance for those 60 and over (no income eligibility).  The IRS offers the TCE program during regular tax season, which typically runs from January 1 to April 15, although some participating organizations may continue the program for longer. The volunteers that help you with your taxes are trained by the IRS to answer questions about retirement-related issues unique to seniors. Many volunteers are retired professionals.   The AARP Tax-Aid program runs the majority of the TCE Sites, although various nonprofits and charities have TCE sites. Many sites have language specialists to help those whose primary language is not English.  What TCE Sites Can Help With  In general, TCE sites can prepare basic state and federal tax returns. Some sites not be able to help with the following income, expenses, or credits:   Schedule K-1 income (reported on forms 1065, 1120S, and 1041)  Sale of home (reported on Form 1099-S)  Cancellation of debt (reported on form 1099-C)  International returns  Typically, TCE sites cannot help with complicated returns, including:  Self-employment income with an overall loss to report, more than $25,000 in expenses, or deductions for depreciation or business use of the home Complex capital gains or losses, or when cost basis is not reported Oil and gas royalties  Rental income and expenses – some sites certified for military returns can do these for military personnel only Other forms for complex tax concerns  Finding a TCE Site Near You  Some TCE sites take appointments, while others operate on a walk-in basis only. To find a location near you, call 800-906-9887 or for the AARP Tax-Aide site, call 1-888-227-7669. You can also search for a TCE site using the  IRS Free Tax Prep website  or the  AARP Tax-Aide Site Locator .  Make sure you read the IRS’s recommendations for  what to bring  when you visit a TCE site.  Consider taking full advantage of programs like TCE and  VITA  for help completing your tax return! "} 
{"prompt":"How do you balance debt and savings? Here’s what our research found.","completion":"If you’re paying down debt, saving money may be a low priority for you. After all, you’re probably paying interest on your debt every month, so paying off your debt more quickly means keeping more money in your pocket long-term.  It’s harder to save when you have debt  Our research found that Savers with a very good or excellent credit score (the two highest categories) were more likely to save at least $20/month than Savers with lower credit scores. Savers who had no debt or a manageable amount of debt were also more likely to save.   What do the experts say?  Many experts believe that maintaining or building a small emergency fund is crucial even if you have debt. SaverLife’s Financial Coach Saundra Davis agrees. She says many people ask her, “Should I save or pay down my debt?” Her recommendation is  a balanced approach . Focus on paying down debt, but don’t eliminate saving entirely. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Teach Your Kids About Budgeting for Special Events and Purchases","completion":" Hooray to anyone willing to teach their children about budgeting for special events!  Successful money managers don’t become that way overnight. It’s a skill that needs to be taught and practiced from an early age. By teaching our children while they are under the safety of our roof, we can guide them through mistakes and help them learn.  Money management principles are the same at any age. The best way to teach children is to keep things at their level of understanding and make it fun.   Start With a Goal  Talk to your child and help them determine how much they need for the special event or purchase. Do some research with them. Spending time and discussing options can be fun. Talking about different ways to achieve the same result can build a skill that will be very useful later on in their life.    Take the goal of saving for a Disney trip or for a Mickey Mouse doll. Do some research online with your child. Discuss the difference in price for the different sizes of dolls. They may decide to go with a smaller, less expensive version once they see how expensive the larger dolls are. At a minimum, this research will help your child determine how much they need to save to get what they want.  Build the Plan  You will need to teach your children that slow and steady will win the race.  Take the amount of money needed and divide it by the number of allowances the child will receive over the time they’ll be saving. Tell them that is the amount of money they need to put away each time. They can keep it in a bank account, a jar, or an envelope. Just make sure they keep it separate from their spending money. One fun idea is to draw a thermometer and track the savings by coloring in the savings as it grows. Keep it on the refrigerator or the wall in your child’s room. This visual will help them see the progress and keep them motivated.  Be Encouraging  We all know that saving can become tedious. This is even true for adults, so children will need a lot of encouragement. When they start to waiver, remind them of the goal they set and help them to envision that final day when they reach the goal and have the money they want for the special event or purchase. A simple reminder that every candy bar they don’t buy will move them closer to getting what they really want can do the trick.    On the other hand, sometimes we have to allow our children to learn from their mistakes. This is the hardest thing to do as a parent. We want to rescue our children when they are hurting. But, if we teach our children at an early age, with the little things, that they have choices and will suffer the consequences of those choices, we can save them from making the big mistakes in adulthood.  Celebrate Success!  Once your child has reached the goal, celebrate! Put on some music and dance around the room. Post their success on social media (if they’re comfortable with it). This is a huge deal and should be treated as such. This will also reinforce the actions they took to get to this achievement which will encourage them the next time they have a financial goal.  For more information about teaching kids, Dave Ramsey has a series of children’s books that teach money management principles. Junior learns about work, saving, spending, and giving. All are excellent books to read to or with your children. "} 
{"prompt":"How Can People on Government Assistance Save for Retirement?","completion":"“Where are the best places for people on state assistance to start saving for retirement? I’m looking for something with low starting balances and low monthly transfers to the account. Do you recommend any financial companies, savings accounts, government-issue bonds, stock market?? I am so confused!”  Submitted by Jessica L.  I want to acknowledge your foresight in thinking about retirement savings. One of the challenges you are facing is the “asset means test,” which can be a barrier to receiving public benefits if you have savings that exceed the eligibility threshold.  Start with Small Savings  Your first instinct is right on. Begin saving small amounts in an account that is liquid in case you have a financial emergency. I call this a “save/don’t spend” account. If you are on state assistance, investing in the stock market may be more of a risk than is appropriate. I suggest first making sure that your daily living expenses and emergency savings are fully covered.  Some states are building “Secure Choice” retirement accounts specifically for low- and moderate-income residents. The  Pew Charitable Trusts  offers a deeper dive into this topic.  Steps For Building Savings  So what now? Here are a few things to keep in mind:   Focus on your current financial situation. Make sure you have a budget that is working for you and you are able to stick to it consistently. Identify any money available for savings.  Save small amounts every month in an account that is accessible. You can use this money as your emergency fund and it can become the “base” of your retirement fund. Make sure you stay under the eligibility threshold as long as the state assistance is necessary for your financial stability.  Remember that any assets that are held in your name are subject to review by the state. Some assets are excluded and will not impact your benefits. Cash savings and investments are often subject to the asset limits.  Stay on top of local efforts to remove asset limits or state retirement programs.  Contact a  financial coach or counselor  if you need additional help.   Learn Your Local Eligibility Rules  The savings limits vary from state to state. Check your local community to make sure you’re following the eligibility guidelines. There are efforts around the country to remove this savings barrier for people who are attempting to build financial security. However, the reality is that you should be thoughtful about saving if you need the benefits for your current living expenses. "}

{"prompt":"How to Track Your Tax Refund","completion":" It’s only natural to want to know the status of your tax refund. Is it being worked on? When will your refund reach your checking account? When will your refund check arrive? Many people rely on a tax professional or tax software to get this information. But you can also go straight to the IRS!  How Long Does It Take to Get My Refund?  Before we talk about that, let’s talk about how long a refund typically takes. The IRS says that most refunds are received within 21 days for electronic tax filings. In some cases, it can take longer. If the IRS needs more information or flags your return to ensure that you are the valid taxpayer, this process can be delayed. In both of these cases, the IRS will send you a letter letting you know what else they need.  Mailed-in tax returns typically takes 6 to 8 weeks to process. Amended tax returns (ones that you change or correct) can take up to 16 weeks to process. For 2019 amendments, the IRS started to allow electronic filing of amendments, but it can still take up to 16 weeks even if filed electronically.  What Else Can Cause My Tax Return to Be Delayed?  The most common delay is for those that receive the  Earned Income Tax Credit  or the Additional Child Tax Credit. Tax returns with these credits are put on hold until February 15th. The reason for this delay is concerns over fraud – not by you, but by criminals. Let’s say a criminal files a tax return before you and claims your children as dependents. Since the IRS holds the return, it gives you more time to try to file yours, realize someone else has claimed your children, and inform the IRS what has happened. This process helps the IRS ensure that the tax refund is going to the right person. If you claim either or both of these credits, the IRS may not update the status of your refund for several days after February 15th.  How to Check the Status of Your Tax Return  Knowing all this, you can check your refund status for current filings on  IRS.gov . To get the status you will need your Social Security Number, your filing status, and the refund amount. You can also use  IRS2Go , the official IRS mobile app, to check your refund.  If you’d prefer to use a phone, you can get automated tax refund information at this number: 1-800-829-4477. And the general line for IRS questions is 1-800-829-1040. Usually calling this line when your refund status indicates that it is processing will not get you any additional information. If you submit an amended return, you can get the status on the  IRS website . Note that the IRS says it can take up to 3 weeks to show in the system.   Waiting for a tax refund can be frustrating, but I hope you can use this information to stay up to date and know when to expect your refund. "} 
{"prompt":"How many credit cards should I have?","completion":"“Hi Saundra! As someone who is getting her credit back in order, I want to be wise about applying for credit cards. I have two and working hard to keep them both under 30% utilization. I’m considering applying for one last card. How many credit cards is too many?”  Submitted by Laurin O.  There are many opinions out there about credit. Some say that you shouldn’t use credit cards at all, while others say that credit cards can be a helpful financial tool when used wisely. I tend to be in the latter group. I want people to be confident using all financial instruments (banking, matched savings, debt, etc.) and I want them to know how to choose what is best for their financial goals.  Think about what having that third card would accomplish for you. What is the benefit of adding a third card? You mention “working hard” to maintain a 30% utilization rate. Does that mean you are using the cards to meet your expenses? If so, how might access to more credit change your financial choices?  Only you know the answer to “too many” cards, so focus on the point of the cards. Credit utilization (both collective and on individual accounts), the number of cards you have, and your credit history all impact your credit score. Adding a credit account can adversely impact two components (average length and number of accounts), not to mention the potential for over-extending yourself.  If you aren’t sure that what you are doing is working for you try using a free  credit scoring simulation  to see how adding that third card that might impact your goal.

{"prompt":"How to Plan for the Cost of College with Your Kids","completion":" As a financial coach, I encourage parents to talk to their children about college as early as possible. Nowadays, college is one of the most expensive costs, next to a car or a home. Enrolling, paying, and attending college is also a complicated process.  Leaving this in the hands of an 18-year-old is unfair. Your child has no idea the true cost of anything, let alone college. They have no idea the mental and financial havoc a huge student loan debt will do to their futures. As parents, I urge you to step in and have enough courage to be willing to say no to an expensive school, so your kids can say yes to a future without huge student debt.  How to Start the Conversation  Let your kids know:  You want to be part of the decision. You’ll work with them so they don’t make a decision they will regret. You love them enough to say no to a college that will saddle them with debt they’ll be paying off when your future grandchild goes to college.  Important Questions to Discuss with Your Kids  Discuss whether they even want to go to college. If they’re hesitant, consider a local community college or trade school.  Be honest with your kids about how much you can financially support them. There is no shame in saying you cannot pay for college. The earlier they know, the longer you and your child have to research scholarships, grants, and other options to pay for college.  Encourage your kids to get jobs that pay for colleges like the military, Peace Corps, or even companies like Starbucks. Show your kids the  cost of their education choices . If they want to go to an expensive private school, show them how much debt they will have along with their  average starting salary . It doesn’t take a lot of math to figure out a $150,000 loan for a degree with an average career salary of $40,000 may not make sense. As their parent, you have to step in to protect their future. Use an  Expected Family Contribution Calculator  to estimate how much you may have to pay for college.   Research Other Resources for Paying for College  Next, talk with your kid’s school counselor about ways to pay for their college expenses.  Ask the counselor about tutoring programs to boost their college entrance exam scores. A high SAT or ACT score can equal scholarships, free tuition, or reduced tuition.  Find out how early your can start taking college entrance exams. Encourage your child to focus on their talents, whether athletic or academic. Work with your school counselor to research and apply for scholarships.   Talk to your child and their school counselor about your child either attending a local college and living at home or attending a local college for the first two years and then transferring to a 4-year college.  The kindest thing you can do for your child is to be honest about how much you can afford to help them pay for college. They will survive not going to their first college choice. They will survive living at home while they go to college. But they may struggle for 20 years to pay off $100,000 in student loan debt. Taking the time to engage with your kids about college will help protect their financial futures. "} 
{"prompt":"What’s holding me back from getting approved for a credit card?","completion":"What’s holding me back from getting approved for a credit card?  Submitted by anonymous.  There are  many reasons  that credit card companies deny an application for a credit card. They review your application and your credit history to assess if you have stable income and how likely you are to pay them back (on time). You may be denied if your credit reports show limited or negative history, or if you have too many open accounts.  If you have been denied, you have the right to review the report they used to make their decision. This is a great time to review your credit report so you know exactly what potential creditors see. Keep in mind that each time you submit a credit application, you get an “inquiry” on your report. Inquiries can actually can make your credit score go down. Be thoughtful about submitting applications and create a plan to establish or build your credit. "} 
{"prompt":"How do you use your tax refund?","completion":"Every month, part of your paycheck is sent straight to the government to pay your taxes. But at the end of the year, most people owe less than they’ve already paid – so they get money back from the government. These tax refunds are a huge influx of money for many American families.  If you’re struggling to save every month, your tax refund can be a great way to get started. After all, without knowing it, you’ve been putting away money every month that you can’t touch! Even if you already have a plan for your tax refund, putting some of it into savings can go a long way.  How Savers Used Their Refunds  SaverLife Savers received an average of $3,464 in refunds in 2018. Here’s how they said they used that money:   As you may have noticed, these numbers add up to more than 100%. Savers often told us they used their refunds for multiple goals.  One Saver named Rocio told us, “My tax refund is a blessing because I can tell my son that I am able to pay his school classes and education.” Another Saver named Cortney said, “I wanted to save my tax refund, but I had to have some car repairs done, so most of my tax refund went toward that.” "} 
{"prompt":"Should I save for my child in a custodial account or a 529 account?","completion":"Should I save for my child in a custodial account so he can use that money for whatever he chooses or should I save in a 529 account?  Submitted by anonymous.  Think about the goal YOU have for your child. What is the point of the savings?  A 529 is a good choice for children’s savings, but there are limitations. If you want your child to have more flexibility, there are other options. A Roth IRA, for example, allows you to withdraw your original contributions without penalty. The thing I like about this option is that you can use it for your children or for your own retirement if your little darling ends up getting oodles of scholarship cash and doesn’t need your money.  If you’re going to stick with an account for your child, keep in mind that a 529 is treated as a parent’s asset for the purpose of financial aid, whereas a custodial account is treated as the student’s asset. This can result in a higher Expected Family Contribution (EFC).  If you want to learn more about options for saving for your child, you can do some additional reading about  custodial accounts  and  using IRAs for educational expenses . "} 
{"prompt":"3 Reasons to Set Up an Automatic Savings Plan","completion":"There are endless strategies for saving money, but one that comes up again and again is setting up an automatic transfer. Lots of research, including our research here at SaverLife, shows that this is a good way to save more. In fact, SaverLife members who set up automatic savings transfers are 5-6% more likely to save at least $20/month.  Are you on the fence about setting up an automatic savings transfer? Here are some reasons we think you should give it a try:  1. Save without thinking about it  We all lead hectic lives. It’s hard to manage many competing priorities – so why not take one thing off your to-do list? By automating your savings, it happens without any effort. Many Savers tell us they set up a small automatic transfer and actually forgot about. Then, months later, they were shocked to see how much money they’d build up so easily.  2. Make saving a habit  At SaverLife, we like to say that saving is a behavior, not a balance. Even if you’re not able to save as much as you’d like, putting money away every month helps establish a habit of saving.  3. Have a separate savings account to manage your money  Everyone wants to save more, but if you keep money in a single account, it can be hard to compartmentalize which money you’re saving. By separating out a little bit of money every week or month, you’ll be able to visually see how much money you have for spending.  But be careful!  Many people are concerned about setting up an automatic transfer because they worry they will incur overdraft fees. This is an important concern. One option is to turn off overdraft protection, so that if you try to withdraw more than you have in your checking account, the transaction is denied instead of hitting you with an overdraft fee.  But for some people, automatic savings transfers may just not be the right way to save – and that’s great too! We want you to find a system that works for you. "}

Your 90-Day Credit Sprint  The first thing I want you to do is check your budget to prepare for a 90-day credit-building sprint. During this sprint, you’ll focus on paying all your bills on time and  reducing your utilization rates , two crucial factors that determine your credit score.   Create a plan with checkpoints at 90 days, 6 months, and one year.  Work the plan by using free services like Credit Karma or Credit Sesame.  Check your progress regularly. If you have a credit card that offers a free credit score, you can use that. Make sure you’re not paying for scores.  Celebrate! Don’t miss out on an opportunity to recognize your progress when you reach your checkpoints or other big milestones.   Long-Term Credit Building  Create an ongoing plan for yourself to make sure that your credit score reflects your hard work and makes you a good candidate for new credit should you need it.  As part of this plan, it’s important that you conduct an  annual review  of your credit report to make sure it is accurate because this information will determine your credit score.

{"prompt":"Can I trade in my new truck for a cheaper car?","completion":" I have a truck that I just bought for $35,000. It’s now worth about $31,000. Can I trade my truck in for a $20,000 car? What happens with my negative equity on the truck and my sedan that I just paid for with the trade – in value?  Submitted by Jae E.  It’s common to buy a car and want to trade it in the next year for another new or used vehicle. In my own life, upside down car loans have probably cost me thousands of dollars. If you owe more on something than it’s worth, in the terminology of the industry, that is known as being upside-down. This applies to roughly half of all new-car buyers, according to Cars.com.  Let’s crunch the numbers  You bought a truck for $35,000, but now it is worth $31,000. That’s a $4,000 reduction in value. If you financed $35,000 on your vehicle for 60 months with a 4.27% interest rate, your payments are about $648.85/month. Your loan balance after 12 months would be approximately $28,583.69. If your truck has depreciated 25% or about $8750* in year one, the trade value would be about $26,250** even though the book value is $31,000. Unless you sell to an independent buyer, you hardly ever get book value when you trade a car with the dealer.   Based on this scenario, you would be upside-down on your loan about $2,334*** after one year. In this case, your new car purchase price is $20,000, but you owe $28,584. It’s only worth $26,250, so you would be paying $20,000 plus the balance of $2,334 or be paying and financing $22,334 under this scenario.  Avoiding Upside-Down Car Loans  To prevent being upside-down car loans again, try to avoid buying new cars unless you have the funds to put at least 20% down. Unfortunately, many people don’t understand the complicated financial and behavioral consequences of buying, selling, and trading vehicles. Once you’ve cleared up your problems with your upside-down car loan, do what you can to keep yourself from ending up in the same situation again.   *Car Loan Amortization Schedule Year 1 Payment: $7,786.20 Principal: $6,416.31 Interest: $1,369.89 Balance: $28,583.69 **Purchase Price ($35,00025%) Depreciation $8750=$26,250 ***Loan Balance after one year = $28,583.69 – Trade Value $26,250 You owe $2,334 more on the car than it’s worth.

{"prompt":"What loan options do I have for helping my child afford college?","completion":" Starting college is an exciting time for parents and students alike. But this excitement often comes with stress and uncertainty about how to pay for school. You may be wondering what options are available for you and your child.  If you want to help your child cover the costs of higher education, you have many different options. It’s important to understand your options in order to make an informed decision. There are both federal loan options and private loan options. Understanding these two loan options and how to compare them can help you make good decisions.  Should I get a Parent PLUS Loan?  The federal option available to parents is a Direct PLUS Loan, also called a Parent PLUS Loan. This loan has a fixed interest rate. Just like federal student loans, the servicer for this loan is assigned by the Department of Education. For this loan, the student must be enrolled in school at least half time.    To apply for a Parent PLUS Loan, you complete a separate application in addition to FAFSA each year. This application considers your credit and also ensures that you and your child meet the eligibility requirements for federal student aid. These requirements include US citizenship or eligible non-citizenship, financial need. Also the student must be enrolled in an eligible degree or certificate program at the institution they attend. If you qualify, you can borrow enough money to cover the difference between your child’s financial aid and the cost of attendance.    One benefit to the Parent PLUS Loan is that you can defer payments while your child is in school. If you don’t elect to do this, your payments will begin once the loan has been fully disbursed to the school. There are three repayment options for the Parent PLUS Loan: standard repayment, graduated repayment, and extended repayment. This loan can also be eligible for  Public Service Loan Forgiveness  if you consolidate them into a direct consolidation loan. Eligibility for this program and the different repayment options are based on the parent’s occupation.  Parent Plus Loans are in the parent’s name. You cannot transfer these loans to the student at any point in time.  Should I get a private loan to help my child pay for college?  In addition to the Parent PLUS Loan, you can also take out private education loans to help your child pay for school. These loans are different than private student loans that you cosign. Instead, these loans are designed for parents and are held solely in their name. Like the Parent PLUS Loan, private education loans for parents consider your creditworthiness. These private loans can have fixed or variable interest rates depending on the borrowing terms. Your credit will determine the interest rate.  Like the Parent PLUS Loan, you can privately borrow the difference between financial assistance and the cost of attendance.  Depending on the lender, you can select full deferment or interest only payments while your child is in school. Once your child graduates or leaves school, there are often different repayment plans that you can choose.  What is the right way for you to support your child?  Both types of parent loans allow you to help pay your child’s education expenses. Make sure that you can make the payments and understand the terms of the loans, as you are the ones borrowing the money. It’s also important that you are getting the best loan for your situation. Compare interest rates, repayment options, and fees to make an informed decision. "} 
{"prompt":"A Side Hustle Can Fix Your Budget","completion":" There are lots of articles written about cutting expenses in order to make your budget work. But there is an alternative. You can make more money to achieve the same desired result! Getting a side hustle, and bringing in more money each month, will correct the deficit of your budget just as quickly as spending less. You can also do a combination of both.  Side Hustle Ideas  A side hustle no longer has to be the traditional part-time job in addition to your full-time job. This approach will work of course, but let’s consider some alternatives. The key is to find a need and fill it. A few ideas include:  Would you want to try dog sitting or dog walking? House cleaning a few times a month for a friend can net a couple hundred dollars.    What about selling items on the internet? There are several marketplaces where people sell all kinds of things. Driving for a car service allows you to choose your hours.  If you don’t want people in your car, you can always deliver food. If you are a good candidate, you can donate plasma. Plasma centers will pay you for your time, and many offer free babysitting on-site for the time that you are in there. This is only a few hours a week. You can change your tax withholding. If you get a large tax return each year, consider visiting your HR department and asking them to help you adjust the amount of tax you are paying each month. There is no need to “lend” your money to the government (at zero interest) all year, just to get it back in March or April of the next year. You need the money every month, so it should be available to you.  Think outside the box!  Ask your friends and colleagues if they have any ideas for you. They might see a talent in you that you haven’t considered.  A simple side hustle might be all it takes to get you back on track. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Negotiate a Raise","completion":"I always like to say that there are only three things you can do to change your financial situation: make more, spend less, or a combination of the two. But making more money can be easier said than done. It could mean finding a new job, gaining additional skills, or working more hours. Let’s dive into one way you can make more money: negotiate a raise.  Know Your Why  If you’ve been in SaverLife for a while, you’re familiar with my constant refrain of “know your why!” It’s important to go back to your fundamental goals and the roots of your financial desires. If you’ve been thinking about asking for a raise, is it because you don’t feel that your work is being sufficiently valued? Is it really about money, or is there something else going on at work that makes you feel undervalued?  What will this additional money do for your financial life and allow you to accomplish? Get specific! You can consult a  pay raise calculator  to see how a raise will change your monthly and annual pay. And don’t forget that earning more money may put you in a different  tax bracket .  Know Your Worth  When you talk to your supervisor, you’ll need to present a reason you think you deserve more money – not just the reason you need the extra money. Have you been taking on additional responsibility, working longer hours, training other employees? Your pay should reflect your value to the company, so if you have more experience or responsibilities than you did when you were hired, it might be appropriate to ask for more money.  To start brainstorming about how you can frame this conversation, try doing a  SWOT analysis , which helps you identify strengths that you can highlight. Make a few notes on the accomplishments you’re proud of, successes you’ve had at work, and the impact you’ve had on your team or company.  Here are some important questions to have answers for:   What is the business case for increasing your compensation? In other words, how is keeping you happy beneficial to their business bottom line?  What is the standard pay raise in your industry? Many industries have a standard of 3% annual raises.  How does your pay rate compare to other companies in your industry?   Know Your When  Timing matters. If your employer is stressed or trying to finish a project, it’s not the best time to negotiate a raise. The ideal time would be after a big company success where you played a part in the positive outcome. And of course, a performance review is usually a neutral time to have this conversation. Your employer may even be expecting you to ask.  Know Your Bottom Line  Your employer may say no. What next? Have a plan for how you want to proceed. If you intend to stay even without the raise, ask what you need to do differently to get a raise in the future. What expectations are not being met? If you intend to leave if you don’t receive the raise, be mindful that you may need a reference from your current employer.  ***  If you’re on the fence about asking for a raise, remember that you have more leverage than you might think. A  survey from PayScale  found that only 37% of workers have negotiated to increase their pay, but of those who asked for a raise, 70% received one. "}

{"prompt":"Investing 101: Stocks, Bonds, and More","completion":"One of the most common questions I get asked is about investing. How should I start investing? What investment options do you recommend? What is a low-risk investing option? Don’t worry, we’re going to get there. But first, let’s start with something more basic.  Investing is a means to an end, not an end itself  Understanding how stocks and bonds work is pretty cut and dry, but the context matters – and in this case, the context is your financial situation and goals. I want you to start by going back to your “why.” What concrete financial goals do you have for your future?  Your goal could be buying a home, paying for your children or grandchildren to go to college, retiring at a certain age, or saving up to start your own business. Once you know this goal, you can figure out how much money you will need to accomplish it and when you will need this money.  Do you have your “why” ready? Let’s dive in!  What are stocks?  When you buy a stock, you are investing in a company. If the company grows and the stock becomes more valuable, your investment will grow with it. However, if the company fails or becomes less valuable (which happens to companies every day), your stock could be worth less or even nothing.  What are bonds?  When you buy a bond, you are loaning money to a company. The company will then repay your loan with interest at a specific time. The company may also pay you dividends (a percentage of the company’s earnings). Bonds are generally considered “safer” investments than stocks – less likely to lose all their value, but also less likely to increase hugely in value.  What is your risk tolerance?  The stock market as a whole goes up and down regularly. Sometimes it seems to go up, up, and up, and sometimes it plunges down. From 2000 to 2002, for example, the U.S. stock market lost about half of its value. Most investors agree that a big drop is inevitable at some point. So how willing are you to take on that risk? You have to think about the upside AND the downside when choosing to invest.  Creating your portfolio  So there are different types of investments, and those investments carry different levels of risks.   This image is modified from Smart About Money’s  “Determining Your Risk Tolerance” lesson .  Depending on your risk tolerance, you can fill your portfolio with an allocation of risky and safe assets that matches your preferences. Your portfolio should be part of your overall financial plan so take into consideration the status of your savings and ability to weather changes in the economy.  Remember that the “safer” investments carry a different kind of risk, which investors call  inflation risk . This is the risk that, over time, your money will have less buying power due to inflation. In the short run, you don’t have to worry much about inflation; but over decades, inflation will significantly impact the buying power of your money if you keep that money in safe investment vehicles like cash.  Investing is just one piece of the puzzle  I hope you see that investing is not an end in itself. Whether you keep your money in cash or in the stock market, you are taking on certain risks. Remember to view investing as just one piece of your financial life and align it with your short- and long-term goals. While looking into investing, make sure you’re taking care of yourself by maintaining an emergency fund and protecting your important assets.  My perspective on investing is inspired by a great resource called  Transparent Investing . I hope you check out the full guide if you’re interested in learning more.

{"prompt":"Making Your Money Work for You","completion":" Hi, I’m Saundra Davis, financial coach here at SaverLife. Today we’re going to talk about how you make your money work for you.  What is a budget?  If you ask, “Do you have a budget?” many folks will say no, they don’t have a budget. The fact is we all have a budget, whether we know it or not. Money comes in and money goes out and how our cash flows by default becomes our budget.  Is your budget working for you?  The question is: Are you happy with the choices that you make and are your choices getting you what you want? If the way you’re spending your money is not getting you what you want, you might be happier if you make some choices about where you want your money to go before you actually spend it. There are some easy rules of thumb that you can try to see if one of them work for you.  The 80/20 rule  Let’s start with the  80/20 rule . Many people try to live within 80% of your income, making sure that 80% of all your income goes to your living and your lifestyle expenses. So we’re talking about your rent or your mortgage, your food, your transportation, leaving 20% to put in to savings. If you live in an area where it’s just not reasonable to live within 80% of your income, you might have to do a 90/10 percent split: 90% for your living expenses, 10% for savings.  The key is make sure savings factors in to all of your decisions, even if it’s only a little bit and that you put your savings aside first before you pay all of your bills.  Re-evaluate your new strategy  Now the question is: How will you know if this is working? Try on a new approach for a short period of time – one, two, or three months – to determine if you’re happier with the choices that you’re making. Remember you’re the boss. Your money, your decisions. You can decide how you save and how you spend.  What are you saving for? "} 
{"prompt":"5 Reasons Why You Can’t Stick to Your Budget and How to Fix It","completion":" For years, I struggled to budget. I was frustrated that I was following all the budgeting rules but still coming up short. After carefully looking at my spending over a few months, I realized I was making several budgeting mistakes.  Once I corrected the errors, I was able to stick to a budget that helped my family become debt-free, save money, and buy a house. Below are some reasons people struggle to stick to a budget and how to overcome them:  1. Budgeting Only for Monthly Bills  Ideally, a budget is a written plan for how you are going to spend all your money on a monthly basis. I find the categories most people fail to include are school activities, restaurants, groceries, gas, entertainment, personal care, and gifts.  These are typically expenses without billed statements that go up and down each month. Either use your online bank budgeting tools or a  budgeting app  to track your spending to make sure your budget truly reflects all your monthly spending.  2. Having Unrealistic Expectations  It takes about three months to adjust to budgeting. Give yourself the grace to make mistakes and learn from them. Be realistic; it’s tough to go from eating out every night to making homemade organic meals. It’s okay to have a few frozen meals and limit eating out to your busiest days. Also, look for opportunities to make the most of your spending by dining at restaurants where  kids can eat free .  3. Overspending in One Area  If you spend most of your paycheck on a car or home, you will struggle to cover unexpected expenses (see #4). One rule of thumb is to spend no more than 25-35% of your take-home pay on a mortgage or rent. Another for cars is the  20/4/10 rule : Make a down payment of at least 20%, finance your vehicle for no more than four years, and spend 10% or less of your gross monthly pay on total monthly car expenses (car payment + insurance).  4. No Savings  Savings should cover at least two types of needs: known and unknown expenses. Upcoming known expenses include scheduled car and home maintenance, car registration and gifts. The other need is to cover those unfortunate surprises—unusually high costs like transmissions repairs, medical expenses or a busted pipe in your home. Try to save at least three months of expenses in an account at a different bank than the one you use for daily spending.  5. Not Updating Your Budget Monthly  Your budget should change as your spending needs change. Examples include higher daycare expenses during school breaks, a higher electric bill in the summer, or a higher gas bill in the winter. Overlooking these fluctuations can have you scrambling to cover expenses.  Don’t lose hope! With a few tweaks, you can find success with budgeting. "}

Just think of all the things you wish you had known when it came to handling money and pass that wisdom onto your kids. "} 
{"prompt":"3 Steps for Recovering from a Financial Setback","completion":"What happens when you have a financial setback? You may feel defeated and even hopeless when your efforts to save take a hit.  Saving helps prevent financial emergencies  Consider this: many of the financial hiccups we face are NOT actual emergencies. For example, we know that if we own a car we are likely to need repairs. Of course, they become emergencies because they usually happen when we are least prepared.  Preparation is the whole point of starting a saving habit. You may have to dip into your savings to pay for car repairs or other unexpected hits to your wallet – and that is exactly the reason to create a habit of saving.  1. Resources for handling emergencies  If (well, I guess we should say “when”) you have a financial setback, do what you need to do to address the situation. Look at all of the options available to you, including your savings. Your long term financial health is sure to be better if you choose the lowest cost options (money you’ve saved, borrowing from family/friends) or  small dollar loans  from a credit union (try to avoid payday lenders).  2. Revisit your savings goals  Be sure that you have a plan to repay yourself – just like you would if you borrowed from someone else. Once you have dealt with the emergency, get back on track. If you can add a little extra each month, you will rebuild your savings account in no time.  This is also a great time to look at your financial priorities and goals and create a savings target for unplanned expenses. A good starting point is the total amount of ALL of your insurance deductibles (health, auto, renter’s/homeowner’s). That way, you always know your financial protection plan is secure.  3. Don’t dwell in shame  Keep in mind, financial emergencies are often normal situations that we simply weren’t prepared for. Abusing ourselves with shame or blame is never helpful.  Learn the lesson, leave the shame.  What do you want to do to be better prepared next time (and we know there is always a next time)? "} 
{"prompt":"How to Manage What Gets Charged to a Credit Card","completion":" Credit can be a valuable tool in your personal finance arsenal. It allows you to buy things you need and earn points or cash back. It also offers a way to conduct secure transactions online and provides some protections against theft and fraud. But, if not managed properly, it can be a road to high-interest debt that can be difficult to pay off. So, what is the secret to successfully managing what you charge to your credit card?  What Should I Charge to My Credit Card?  The best place to start when deciding what charges to put on your credit card is your budget. If you have already budgeted for an expense and know that you can pay for it, you can put it on your credit card. This will allow you to take advantage of credit card rewards while giving you peace of mind, knowing you can pay your credit card bill in full each month.   Examples of expenses that make sense to put on a credit card include:  groceries gas your monthly Netflix or Apple Music subscription your child’s monthly sports or music lessons  These are all items that should already be included in your budget each month. So, instead of using your cash to pay the bill directly, you have the option to use your credit card. You can charge the expense. Then, pay the credit card bill using the money you budgeted for the expense.  What Should I NOT Charge to My Credit Card?  While it can be tempting to put all your monthly bills and expenses on your credit card, it is not necessarily a good idea. If you put expenses you haven’t budgeted for on your credit card, you may not have the means to pay them when the bill comes.  Impulse purchases or purchases for friends or family who don’t have the money to make the purchase on their own should not be charged to your credit card. In both of these cases you don’t have money set aside to pay for the item. So, when the credit card bill comes you will have to find the money to pay for it elsewhere. This can mean taking money budgeted for something else to pay the bill or only making the minimum payment. Neither option puts you in an optimal financial situation.  It can also be tempting to put larger bills like your annual tax payment or a large legal bill on a credit card. If you put your tax payment on your credit card, you will face a service fee that can be nearly 2%. This makes your bill even higher than it already was. And legal bills can be large due to high hourly rates. This can result in high interest charges if you can’t pay the credit card bill in full when it comes due.  Should I Use My Credit Card for Emergencies?  Things in life happen that we can’t always plan for. And these emergencies often come with expenses. If you have to put more of your credit card than you can pay off in a month due to an emergency, that is okay. Be sure to pay as much as you can each month to minimize interest charges. And pay the bill off in full as soon as you can.  Best Practices for Credit Card Management  Only charge expenses to your credit card that you know you can pay in full when the bill comes. This will help save you money on interest. It will also help you build a good credit score. Your payment history accounts for 35% of your credit score. If you know you can pay your bill on time each month, this will help build up your score.    When calculating your score, credit scoring agencies consider your available credit to account for 30% of your score. They want to see a utilization ratio of 30% or less (lower is better). This means that you aren’t carrying a balance of more than 30% of your available credit (across all open credit accounts). Paying your bill off each month will keep your credit usage low and leave you with a larger amount of available credit.  Allowing your budget to dictate your credit spending will help you keep your usage in check. It will also allow you to use credit as a tool to help you out financially instead of allowing it to become a burden that weighs you down. "} 
{"prompt":"How much of my income should I save?","completion":" Financial experts recommend that you save at least ten percent of your take-home income (after taxes have been deducted). But what’s more important than the amount you save is getting into a habit of saving based on your personal goals and what’s realistic for you. To determine what makes sense for you:  List and prioritize your life or financial goals  How do you want your life to be different six months from now? In a year? In five years? For your top goal, put a date and dollar amount on it. How much would need to set aside each month to reach that goal? Is that amount possible for you? If not, what could you change?  Prepare a realistic spending plan  Gather up all of your records related to income and expenses for one month. Then subtract your expenses from your income. How much is left over? Does that feel right? Could you make changes to your earning and spending habits to set more money aside?  Consider your overall financial picture  If you have a significant amount of debt, are having trouble making ends meet, or are in the middle of a financial crisis, taking care of those situations should take precedence over saving for future goals. Once your financial situation has stabilized, think about starting to save for an emergency fund to provide a safety net if your car breaks down or you lose your job.  Start small  If you are not in the habit of saving or money is tight, commit to a small amount that you will be able to set aside on a monthly basis to start growing your savings over time.  Find a savings product that works for you  There are a variety of savings products out there that offer different rates and features. Of course, getting the best rate possible is important. And there may be other features that are important to you. Do you want your savings account attached to your checking account for easy transfers? Do you want restricted withdrawals to prevent temptation?  Save irregular and extra income  As your income grows or you have unexpected windfalls (bonuses, tax returns,  stimulus checks ), plan to set most, if not all, of that money aside to boost your savings.  ***  Keep in mind that finances are personal!  Experts may recommend ideals, but it’s up to you to determine your own sound and realistic financial practices. Follow these tips to build your savings habit today. "} 
{"prompt":"Game Plan for Starting a Small Business","completion":" When I first became a financial planner, my specialty was small business owners. I also headed my local Chamber of Commerce’s Small Business committee. Over the years, I received a lot of excellent business advice. Below are the top five most impactful business tips I’ve heard:  Get your personal financial house in order  If you plan to leave your job, create a budget based on your new income. Live on your new budget for three to six months before quitting to gauge if you can live on the new budget. Have at least six months of income saved for household emergencies. In my first six months of business, I had over $5,000 in unexpected expenses. My emergency savings account was a life-saver. Pay off your debts, particularly your credit card debts.  Get buy-in from your family  Starting a business is going to be a sacrifice for everyone in your family. Starting a business is an emotional, relational, time, and financial strain on your family. If any of these areas are already suffering, business ownership at this time may make it worse. Discuss with your family your new work hours and any changes that may impact your family.   Take the time to research  As a former head of a Small Business Committee, I saw so many businesses come and go because they did not study their business idea. Just because you think it’s a great idea does not mean people will pay you what you think your idea is worth it.  SCORE  is a free mentorship program for business owners. A mentor can save you thousands of dollars in mistakes by helping you navigate business decisions.  Create a business plan  I saw many businesses fail because they did not have a business plan. A business plan can help you do the following:  Assess how much money you would need to start your business (it’s always higher than you think) Help you estimate how long before your business breaks even (it’s typically longer than you think) Decide if your business location is ideal Market your business to get clients Luckily you can tap into a lot free or low-cost help to starting and maintaining your business such as  SCORE ,  SBA ,  Small Business Development Centers , and your local  chamber of commerce  or business association.  Start Small  Consider using what some call an upside-down business strategy. The model takes advantage of the low cost and ease of creating an online presence through social media and a website to build an audience of your future customers. The low cost allows you to refine your message and understand what your audience wants. Once you create an audience of people who know, like, and trust you, you can confidently develop products and services because you know from your audience what they want. This model is less costly and risky than the traditional way of starting a business, which is to start with the product, then try to create a message.  No matter what method you use, the important thing is to start from where you are and just get started. "} 
{"prompt":"Should I Rent or Buy a Home?","completion":" Renting versus owning – how to determine which is right for you  Choosing whether to own or rent a home is a big decision. The “right” answer for you will be deeply personal, based on a few key considerations that we will explore below.  1. Examine your personal values  A good place to start is with your personal values. What is really important to you in your life? Family? Freedom? Security? How do these values fit with different housing situations?  2. List and prioritize your goals  Next, think about your future. Where do you want to be in five years – financially and in general? What other financial or life goals do you have? These could include reducing your debt, paying for education, or moving to be closer to family. Where does homeownership rank among those goals?How might it affect your other plans?  3. Weigh the trade-offs of renting versus owning  Every decision has trade-offs – things you get and things you give up. Both renting and owning come with their own sets of trade-offs.  Owning a home is an important goal for many people. Homeownership has many advantages, but also requires a significant investment of time, energy, and money. It comes with responsibilities and risks.  To help make the choice that is right for you, weigh some of the trade-offs 1  listed below. Think about which would impact you the most and what you care about.  Benefits of Owning: Shelter and Wealth-Building  You may want to own a place that is all yours – a home that you can modify to fit your needs. Or, you may want to build wealth and increase your net worth over time. For many people, their home is both a shelter and their largest financial asset. When you own a home, you build equity by making monthly payments that reduce your mortgage loan balance. You can also build equity when your home increases in value over time. Equity is the value of your home minus what you owe. While you want this to be a positive number, home equity is not guaranteed.  In summary, here are the benefits you should consider:  Greater control over decisions related to home and living environment Potential to build equity Possible tax benefits Roots in one community and school system No home inspections by landlords or other authorities, greater privacy With a fixed rate mortgage, principal, and interest payments stay the same  Drawbacks of Owning: Maintenance Costs and Less Mobility  Understandably, homeownership is not for everyone. You have to make repairs when needed. You have to change your spending habits, so you can make your monthly payments on time and save for emergencies and repairs. Many people choose to rent so they can have the freedom to move around. Or you may prefer that your landlord has to take care of maintenance and repairs.  Read through these downsides of owning and think about how you value them compared to the benefits of owning.  Risk of property value loss Limited flexibility with relocation Higher upfront costs (compared to renting) Usually higher monthly costs for housing and utility expenses Liability for accidents on the property Responsibilities for home repairs, maintenance, and yard work  Both renting and owning require you to make payments on time. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing your home through eviction or foreclosure.  4. Take a look at your current financial situation.  In this moment, where are you financially? How would you rate your  financial health ?  Your financial health can affect your ability to rent or own a home. Most landlords and all lenders will consider your credit history, for example, when deciding to rent you a place or give you a home loan. Lenders, however, look more carefully at your overall financial health when measuring your ability to buy a home.  You will need a credit score of 620 for a conventional loan or 580 for a government-backed FHA loan to buy a home.  Additionally, you must have enough saved for the upfront costs of homeownership, including the down payment and closing costs. On average, these costs add up to 15 percent of a home’s purchase price. Finally, you must show that you earn enough to make the new mortgage payment while continuing to pay your living expenses and debt.  If you wish to buy a home and your financial health does not yet measure up, what would it take to get you financially ready?  5. Get more information  If you are leaning toward homeownership, sign up for a homeownership education class from a  local nonprofit organization . Buying a home can seem like a complicated process, with many people and steps involved. A class can give you the tools and knowledge to successfully navigate the purchase process and take a realistic look at what you can expect from homeownership. The more you know, the easier it will be if you decide that homeownership is right for you.  1  Trade-offs adapted from  Motivational Interviewing  by William R. Miller and Stephen Rollnick. "} 
{"prompt":"Everything You Need to Know About High-Yield Savings Accounts","completion":" When it comes to saving money, where you save it can be almost as important as saving it. There are many different savings options available today. One that is often talked about is the high-yield savings account (HYSA). But what is a high-yield savings account and when is it the best choice for your savings?  What is a High-Yield Savings Account?  A HYSA is a savings account that has a higher interest rate than a regular savings account. According to  Investopedia , HYSA interest rates are typically 20-25% higher than the interest rates of regular savings accounts. This higher interest rate allows you to earn more on your savings. Online banks typically offer the best rates on HYSAs. If you’re considering opening a HYSA, it’s important to understand the benefits as well as the downsides.  Benefits of a High-Yield Savings Account  One major benefit of a HYSA is that it allows you to earn more interest. This helps your money work harder for you and can help you reach your savings goals even faster.    Another thing that can be helpful for some people is that a HYSA allows you to separate out your savings. Because HYSAs are typically offered by internet-only banks, you often cannot open one at the same institution as your checking account. Having an account at another bank for your longer-term savings goals can help you separate these goals from your day-to-day finances. This separation can keep you on-task and ensure that your savings are used for your intended purpose.  Even with accounts at multiple banks, it is still easy to transfer funds. Typically, HYSAs at internet banks will allow for electronic funds transfers to and from your regular bank. This is helpful because it makes contributing to your HYSA easy. You can also often use the bank app to deposit checks into your HYSA. This access is helpful when your accounts are at different institutions.  Drawbacks of a High-Yield Savings Account  When considering a HYSA, it’s important to also understand some of the drawbacks. Some HYSAs have more rules that regular savings accounts. They may require you to meet an initial minimum required deposit to open an account. When you are just starting to save money, this can create an unnecessary challenge. HYSAs also sometimes have account maintenance fees and other charges. These charges and fees may cancel out the benefits of the higher interest rate.    One big drawback of some HYSAs is the time that it can take to transfer funds from your savings to your everyday checking account so that you can use them. The time that these transfers take is heavily dependent on which banks you are transferring to and from. This is definitely a part of a HYSA that you’ll want to understand when you open your new account.  It’s important to note that like all savings accounts, HYSAs are subject to the banking regulation known as Regulation D. This limits certain types of transfers and withdrawals to and from the account to six per month. Make sure that you understand these limitations when moving money in and out of your savings accounts.  Final Thoughts on High-Yield Savings Accounts  Overall, the HYSA is becoming more common in the personal finance community. A higher interest rate can help your money work harder for you.   HYSAs are a good place to save for your bigger goals like buying a house, buying a car, or taking a trip. Depending on the transfer times for you to access your funds, a HYSA could also be a good place to save your emergency fund.  As with any financial product, when you think about opening a HYSA, be sure that you do your research. Find the best account for your particular situation that will work as an integrated piece of your financial plan.  Consider the fees, minimum required deposit, and whether you need access to a debit card or ATM for the account as you pick which institution to use.  A high-yield savings account offers you a great savings opportunity with a higher interest rate. It might fit in well with the rest of your personal financial plan! "} 
{"prompt":"What is a Health Savings Account and Should I Open One?","completion":" If you have a High Deductible Health Plan for your health insurance, then you are eligible for a Health Savings Account (HSA). You can use HSA funds to pay for qualified medical expenses. These expenses can be incurred by you, your spouse, or any dependents listed on your tax return.  There is no need to submit receipts, but you do want to keep these as proof that you used the money for qualified medical expenses. This will come in handy should you ever have an IRS audit.  Advantages to Opening a Health Savings Account  Lower your taxable income.  The money you put into the account is pre-tax. This reduces your taxable income you file your tax return. HSA accounts earn interest tax free.  This means you won’t have to claim the earnings as income on your tax return. HSA contributions don’t expire.  If you don’t use all the money in your account, then it can roll over to the next year. There is no need to “use it or lose it.” You can invest your account into a variety of investments.  There is no minimum requirement. Just remember that some investments are not FDIC insured, so there is a potential to lose money. You can use your HSA as a retirement account.  After you turn 65, any money in the account can be used for any purpose. It is no longer restricted to qualified medical expenses. This makes the account a potential retirement account.  If these advantages are appealing to you and you have a High Deductible Health Plan, then you may want to open an HSA. Saving for medical expenses, and having a great vehicle in which to do it, is an awesome idea!

{"prompt":"7 Questions to Figure Out If You Can Claim Someone as a Dependent On Your Taxes","completion":" It can be confusing to figure out who you can claim as our dependent on your Federal tax return. It’s typically clear whether or not you can claim a child as a qualifying child. The other kind of dependent is a qualifying relative (and they don’t always have to be a relative). This can get a bit more complicated.  There are 7 dependency tests to pass in order to claim a qualifying relative.   1. Dependent Taxpayer Test  To claim a person as a dependent, they cannot be eligible to be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return.   2. Joint Return Test  Usually a person cannot be your dependent if they filed a joint tax return with their spouse. There are some exceptions to this rule. So if you think you should be able to claim someone whom has filed (or will file) a joint tax return, consider doing more research.   3. Citizen or Resident Test  The dependent must be either a US citizen, US National, US resident alien, or a resident of Mexico or Canada. An adopted child passes the this test if the child lived with the taxpayer all year and if the taxpayer is a US citizen or US national.   4. Relationship or Member of Household Test  The following pass this test:  A son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of these. A brother, sister, half brother, half sister, or son or daughter of any of these. A father, mother, or a direct ancestor or sibling of either of them. A stepbrother, stepsister, stepfather, stepmother, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law. Any other person (other than the spouse) who lived with the taxpayer all year as a member of the taxpayer’s household if the relationship does not violate local law. There are some reasonable absences allowed.  5. Not a Qualifying Child Test  The dependent must not be the qualifying child of any other taxpayer for the year.   6. Gross Income Test  The dependent must have a gross income of less than $4,300 in 2020. This includes all income that is not exempt from tax. This is important to note because some people have income that is exempt from tax.   7. Support Test  The taxpayer must provide over half of the dependent’s total support during the year. This doesn’t apply to certain dependents of divorced or separated parents or if a multiple support agreement applies, or if the dependent is under the rule for kidnapped children.   I know this is a lot to consider for something that seems like it should be simple. But many people have households that are more complicated than a parent or two and their children. And if you are in one of those households, I encourage you to take a close look at who can and can’t be a qualifying relative, because under current tax law a qualifying relative qualifies most taxpayers to receive the $500 credit for other dependents. You can  read more and use the IRS’s Interactive Tax Assistant tool .  But one word of warning. Before claiming a dependent, make sure you understand the impact claiming an individual as a dependent may have on any benefits they receive from Federal, state, and local governments.  "} 
{"prompt":"Setting Your Financial Goals","completion":"Goal setting is an inside job.  Think about it. We set our goal first, focusing on a specific and achievable financial target. To be clear, saying “I want to be more financially stable,” or “I want to increase my credit score,” is not the same as setting a goal. We’re talking about what you want to save for, how much you’ll need to get there and when you want to reach that goal. We’re talking dollars and dates.  Let’s start with the “WHAT”: describe one financial goal. Don’t skimp on the dream either, and be very clear about what you want to achieve. Go on, I’ll wait…  Okay, now that you have  named  your first financial goal, think about how your life will be different when you have achieved it. What is your motivation and how will you know when you are satisfied? This is your “WHY.”  Once you know the “WHAT” and “WHY,” we’ll work together on the “HOW,” which is, of course, the only way we achieve our goals. But don’t worry about the “HOW” just yet. For now, just get that exact goal on paper. See how easy that was?  Bottom line? A financial goal without a date and a dollar amount is just a dream.  Taking Action  Here are a few ideas to help you get started on establishing your goal:   Index cards: write your goal and your “why” on an index card and put it somewhere that you can see it often.  Pinterest : build a virtual vision board of one (or more) of your financial goals.  Goal Buddy : This is a tool to help build your goals, define the habits to help you get there, and create tasks that can be exported to your calendar. Oh, and it’s free!  "} 
{"prompt":"What Is a Credit Report?","completion":"Your credit report is a summary of all of your reported financial history. Keep a close eye on this to make sure that it is accurate because it determines your credit score.  Checking your credit report is a first step to achieving some of your financial goals.

{"prompt":"How do I find my credit score?","completion":" How do I find out my credit score? Who wants to know it, and what factors influence its change ?  Submitted by anonymous .  A credit score is a representation of how someone managed their debts. It is meant to help creditors understand our financial responsibility. Payments on our loans and balances on our credit cards are two factors that directly influence our score. In today’s world, having a good credit score means greater chances of having access to money (or other services) in less time, with fewer requirements, and at lower interest rates (or cost).  Who calculates credit scores?  There are several companies that have created credit score formulas. How does it work? They collect historical information about us from our credit reports, run it through their algorithm — and wallah! This process results in a final number (credit score) that is compared to see if we are above, at, or below average. Depending on where we fall, we will qualify or not for different loans or services. Financial entities, for example, buy this information from these companies when evaluating the conditions of a loan contract. It is their way of determining the responsibility we assume when managing our debts.  How credit scores are used  Credit scores are primarily used by financial institutions, such as banks and lenders. But in recent years, they’re increasingly used for other things. For example, insurance companies use credit scores to calculate the price of our auto or life insurance policies. Landlords use them to make renting decisions. Some employers even look at credit scores when hiring. All of them see the credit score as a way to measure responsibility. You can see from these few examples that credit scores are really important in our society.   How can you influence your credit score?  To answer this, we will take one of the most commonly used scores, the FICO score, and see how it’s calculated. Although the exact formula isn’t public, the risk experts who put together the FICO score say it’s based on:  Payment history (whether we pay in time or not) – 35% The amount owed (how much of our credit lines we are using, hint: the more you use, the worse) – 30% The length of our credit history – 15% The types of credit – 10% Inquiries (how often we apply for credit) – 10%  You can find your FICO credit score at  myfico.com .  In short, we can influence our personal credit score by always paying on time, not using a high percentage of our credit lines, having a long credit history, having a variety of credit, and not applying for credit (or services that require a credit check) often.  However, we cannot do magic.  What do I mean? We can positively affect the factors that influence our credit score over time, but this change doesn’t happen instantaneously. Improving your credit is about changing long-term financial behaviors. And changing behaviors of any kind can be challenging. That is why things like paying our bills on time are always stressful. It’s not complicated; it’s about being consistent. "} 
{"prompt":"5 Things to Keep in Mind When Selecting a Savings Account","completion":"A savings account is one of the simplest bank accounts you can get. Nearly all U.S banks and credit unions offer savings accounts. It’s worth it to shop around because accounts have varying fees, minimum balances, and interest rates. Keep the following things in mind when selecting an account.  FDIC Deposit Insurance  You should only bank with financial institutions that are FDIC insured. FDIC insurance protects customer bank deposits up to $250,000 per depositor in the event of bank failure. If a financial institution doesn’t have FDIC protection, pass on it.  Monthly Fees  Read the fine print before opening a new savings account. Some banks will charge fees and you need to know what they are up front. Here are examples of some fees you may encounter:   Account maintenance or administration fees  Withdrawal penalty fees  Minimum balance penalty fees  Deposit penalty fees  ATM use fees  Account link/online banking fees   If your bank does charge any of these fees (not all do), ask your account manager if you can get a fee waiver.  Online Account Access  Today, almost every banking institution has an online presence. You want to make sure you can sign in and access your savings account online so you can bank when, where, and how you want to. Plus, SaverLife only works with savings account that have online access!  Automatic Transfers  Setting up automatic fund transfers to your savings account is one of the best ways to easily save money each month. Make sure that your financial institution and savings account has this capability.  Interest Rates  Financial institutions have varying interest rates so make sure to comparison shop before settling on an account as you’ll want to earn the most competitive savings rate possible. Interest rates at most financial institutions are low right now (generally 2% or less) but it’s still worth it to get the best rate possible. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Build an Insurance Plan to Protect What Matters Most","completion":"We all face risks every day, from driving a car to the ever-present risk of illness or natural disasters. Protecting yourself from these varied risks is a complex task.  Consider a relatively simple risk: adopting a pet. Picture your newly adopted dog, maybe a little frazzled by his new environment. You’re out on a walk and a neighbor approaches your dog. The dog takes a nip at the stranger and now your neighbor has to go to the emergency room for stitches. As she backs away she lets you know that she intends to sue you for the emergency room cost.  Even if you have homeowners’ or renters’ insurance, your policy may not cover this liability. There’s no “perfect” or “right” insurance plan; this is another case where you need to consider your unique circumstances and determine how much risk you want covered.  Here are a few steps to get started:  Do an Inventory  The first thing you need to know is what people, possessions, and other things you want covered. It might help to make a list of everything you can think of. Consider these broad categories:   Health  – your own and other people (or animals) in your family  Life  – how will your family cope with the loss of a family breadwinner?  Children  – how will they be protected?  Property  – what land, structures, or possessions are vital to your family?  Income  – what if you or another family member are unable to work?   Assess Your Risk  There are four ways to manage risk – some are more expensive, and some may not always be practical. One or all of these methods may be appropriate to make sure you are covered adequately.  Risk Avoidance  Eliminate the risk by not engaging in activities that could trigger the risk. For example, you might decide that having a pet or going on a vacation is not worth the risk, so you’re not going to adopt a pet or go on vacation. Of course, this is not always practical, and requires you to sacrifice a lot.  Risk Transfer  An insurance policy allows you to transfer the risk to another entity (the insurance company). Of course, you can never fully transfer a risk. If you’re in a car crash and you have car insurance, your  financial  risk will be covered, but that doesn’t erase any injuries or legal liability.  Risk Reduction  There are easy things you can do to limit risk and increase precautions. For example, to limit the risk of a house fire, you could install smoke detectors. To limit the risk of injury when driving, wear a seatbelt and drive carefully.  Risk Retention  Risk retention means that you decide to accept a risk. In an ideal world, all of your risk would be covered in some way, but of course that may not always be possible. Maybe you decide that you can’t afford to buy a certain type of insurance, and that you would prefer to mitigate your risk and accept any unfortunate consequences. Even if you buy insurance, most plans still require you to first pay a deductible; this deductible cost counts as a risk that you retain.  Build an Asset Protection Plan  Now that you know the different methods for dealing with risk, it’s time to sort out how you want to manage the risks in your life. Put together a plan for each item that you identified in your inventory. It could look something like this:     Asset  Approach  Action    Life  Transfer  Research and buy life insurance     Reduce  Eat healthy and exercise    Auto  Transfer & Retain  Buy car insurance, but retain some  risk with a high-deductible plan     It can be difficult to think about the unpleasant possibilities that life could throw at us at any time. Building an asset protection plan can offer you reassurance that you’ll be able to address these unexpected life events. Who knows, with proper planning you may still be able to adopt that dog! "} 
{"prompt":"What Is Adjusted Gross Income?","completion":" It’s that time of year when you hear tax terms being tossed around, whether on the news, at work by the HR Department, or over coffee with friends. But what exactly do all these terms mean? A commonly used term is Adjusted Gross Income or AGI. What is AGI, and how do you calculate it?  Your adjusted gross income is the amount of money you earned minus all allowable adjustments. You want this number to be as low as possible. Once you know your AGI, you’ll subtract either the itemized deduction amount or the standard deduction amount. The resulting number will be used to calculate the amount of tax you owe. The lower your AGI, the lower the amount of taxes you need to pay.  How to Calculate Your Adjusted Gross Income  Step 1: Calculate Your Income for the Year  This includes your salary, of course.  It could be from Social Security, IRAs, or pensions.  Don’t forget any business income you’ve earned or money from a side hustle. Include alimony and unemployment in this calculation.  Step 2: Add Up All Allowable Adjustments  Here is where you want to find as many as possible. Remember, the lower you get your income, the less tax you have to pay.  Schedule 1 of Form 1040  has a comprehensive list of all the adjustments available. The adjustments are:  Educator expenses Certain business expenses Health Savings Account deduction Moving expenses for members of the Armed Forces Deductible part of self-employment tax Self-employment SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans Self-employment health insurance deduction Penalty on early withdrawal of savings Alimony paid IRA deduction Student loan interest Tuition and fees deduction  Some of these deductions require additional documentation or forms.  They will also be available on the IRS website.   Step 3: Subtract Total Adjustments From Total Income  Congratulations! You have just calculated your Adjusted Gross Income.

{"prompt":"Can’t Wait for Your Tax Refund? Here’s Everything You Need to Know About Refund Advance Loans","completion":" Tax time is an important time for most families. You find out if you’re getting a tax refund. And this year, that assistance is more valuable than ever. For all of those who are wondering, the IRS will start sending out tax refunds in early March. If you anticipate that you will receive a refund this year, or you are claiming your Recovery Rebate Credit through your taxes, you may be looking forward to —and need— those funds.      If you absolutely need your tax refund before the IRS can send it to you, here is a quick guide to all that you need to know about a product you may have heard about: the Refund Advance loan. A Refund Advance loan is debt. It is a loan against the tax refund you are expecting to receive. It is usually between $200 and $4,000. Sometimes, you can get the loan within 24 hours.   You may find yourself in the position where getting money sooner rather than later can make a big difference. For this question, I am setting aside my tax professional hat and putting on my Accredited Financial Counselor® hat. As a financial counselor, I would prefer that you not pay unnecessary fees and charges or to place yourself at risk of having unexpected debt. But I also know that life happens. I suggest asking yourself three questions before rushing to any lender for fast cash.  1. Can I Wait? What Are My Other Options?  This year, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IRS has changed some of its filing dates. They started processing returns on February 12. Tax credits and refunds are expected to go out in early March. This means it may be a few weeks before you receive your funds.   If your bills are paid and you don’t need that money immediately, then can you wait a few extra weeks? If you are planning to make a big purchase, wouldn’t it be better to avoid paying fees and have more money?   2. How Much Does a Refund Anticipation Loan Cost?  The biggest reason to avoid a Refund Advance loan is the cost: it can be expensive. The fees can vary quite a bit, even those ones that offer a 0% loan.  Some  of these have already closed applications for loans, but for those that are still open, the costs can range from zero to hundreds of dollars in tax preparation fees. Usually, the costs of the loan are built-in to the tax preparer’s fee, or the tax preparer may sell additional services to you to pay for the loan. Here is an example: a taxpayer takes out a $500 tax refund loan, and pays a $59 tax preparation fee. This amounts to an APR of 142%.   It’s a good idea to ask yourself if you have other things to spend this money on that would be better for you. Is the charge really worth getting your money faster? Most Americans can  file their taxes for free , and don’t need to pay the tax preparation fee that is bundled with the loan.  3. Can I Accept the Risk and Do I Understand the Terms?  This is the part that often gets ignored. I have shown my clients Refund Anticipation loans in the past. And I’ll tell you, it is rare for someone to actually read the terms and conditions. Typically, they glance and sign. Sometimes not even glance! What you need to be aware of is what happens if your refund is delayed. What happens if the IRS requests additional information before processing your return? Will that increase your costs with additional fees and charges? What happens if the IRS doesn’t give you a refund or gives you a smaller refund than you filed for? Will you get more charges? Will that negatively impact your credit if it happens? I ask these questions because these things all happen. Make sure these risks are worth taking before agreeing to a refund advance.  It’s also important to know more about the lender. In general, borrowing directly from banks is safer and cheaper, because banks are regulated by the government.    This tax year is different from previous years. This year, many households have received unemployment insurance, and this is taxable. (Stimulus checks are not.) If you believe you will owe taxes on any unemployment insurance you received, that can reduce your refund, which can impact the amount that you’ll have to pay back on any Refund Anticipation loan that you take.   ***  If you don’t truly need the money right away, I encourage you to avoid a refund advance. You can put the money that would have gone to more fees toward paying off debt, toward your kids, or whatever is important to you. "} 
{"prompt":"What Are the Benefits of Good Credit?","completion":"    Equifax, one of the top three credit reporting bureaus, considers  credit scores between 670-739 to be good credit scores . FICO is one of the most commonly used credit scoring companies.  FICO  uses information from credit bureaus like Equifax to calculate a three-digit credit score that represents your credit. The scores are calculated based on five categories:   Payment History (your record of paying your bills on time) – 35% of your credit score. Amount Owed (how much of your credit are you using) – 30% of your credit score. Length of Credit History (how long have you had credit) – 15% of your credit score. Credit Mix (how many different types of credit you have) – 10% of your credit score. New Credit (how often you are applying for credit) – 10% of your credit score.  Good credit history of on-time payments, not using too much credit, not trying to get a lot of credit, and having different credit types give businesses an idea of how much they can trust you to pay your bills on time. In a nutshell, if a company feels you will pay them back, you will typically pay less than someone a business may not think will pay them back.  Here are some of the benefits of having good credit:  Lower Annual Percentage Rate (APR)  This is the interest you pay to your creditor for using their credit. The better your credit score, the less interest you pay.   No Security Deposit  Businesses often lower or even eliminate security deposits for people with good credit. Companies use deposits as “insurance,” so if you don’t pay your bill, the business will keep your deposit to pay the missed bill. This is why companies ask for a security deposit from people with no or low credit scores.  Buying a Car  Your credit affects your ability to own a vehicle in a few ways:  Places where you can buy a car . Some dealers will not finance someone with a poor credit score ( typically under 580 for some businesses ) The amount of your monthly payment . Your car payment is a combination of the car’s principal cost and your loan interest rate mixed in with other fees: the higher your interest rate, the higher your car payment. Your ability to get car insurance . Many insurance companies  use your credit history  to decide your premiums or even if they will give you car insurance.  Buying a Home or Rent an Apartment  Your credit score significantly affects your ability to own a home due to the following:  Home loans : Your credit score determines which types of  loans you can get . The more loans you are eligible for, the better. Your credit score determines how much interest you pay, affecting your overall monthly payment. Apartments : Most landlords will review your credit report. Some apartment buildings may require a minimum credit score to approve your application. A high score may also mean a reduction in a security deposit for your apartment. It may also reduce or even eliminate a security deposit for utilities.  Homeowner’s and Renter’s Insurance  Like car insurance, a  homeowner’s  and  renter’s  insurance company will review your credit, which may impact your premiums, meaning more money you may have to pay for your insurance coverage.  Getting a job  Most employers will check your credit. Some employers, like a bank, may require you to have a good credit history. Other places, particularly those that require security clearances, may review your credit to make sure you have a good record.  Good credit history affects many areas of your life. Take the time to review your credit.

{"prompt":"How to Be a Holiday Hero while Sticking to a Budget","completion":"Holidays can be filled with  both joy and stress .  As a starting point, think about the end of the holiday season. How do you want to feel? What experiences are important to you? And of course, what do you want your credit card balance to look like?  What are the holidays about?  As you go into the holiday season, think about what lessons you want your children to take from your celebrations. This is a good opportunity to teach the value of time. Your presence is just as important as the presents. Here’s a list I like of  ways to be present  during the holidays.  You’re setting the foundation for how your children will experience family traditions when they are adults. You’re also modeling financial behavior to your kids, and  teaching them about advertising . What legacies do you want to establish?  Commit to a holiday budget  Our families, and especially our children, may have expectations or wish lists for the holidays. But what do you want to drive your purchasing choices?  If you decide in advance how much you want to spend and how you’ll allocate that money, you may end up in a much better place in January. Once you have a plan, talk to your children about what is important during this season (ideally, before they make that huge list for Santa).  Alternative gift ideas  If you decide to cut back on toys and games, you can still mark the occasion with a different kind of gift. Coupon books for fun holiday activities with your kids are a great way to build memories together.  Plus, with the money you would have spent on toys, you can give investments, 529 contributions, or savings accounts. I think of this as saving money for your kids instead of spending money for them. In the long term, they’ll appreciate the investment in their futures.  ***  The holidays can be a time of community and connection that focuses on our presence with our children.

{"prompt":"SMART Goals Can Help You Achieve Your Dreams","completion":" Think about something that you want to accomplish in the future, like paying off credit card debt or student loans. Have you set a goal that will help you get there, or is it just something that you hope will happen? There is nothing wrong with hoping, as long as it is not your final step. A hope can be vague and open-ended, but a goal is what will guide you in achieving your desired outcome.  How to Create SMART Goals  How can you turn your hopes into goals? By thinking SMART! SMART is an acronym that can help you remember the components of an effective goal. Your goals should be  S pecific,  M easurable,  A chievable,  R elevant, and  T ime- bound. Let’s look at an example.  Specific  Some people tell me, “I want to live debt free!” That’s great, but that is not a very specific goal. In order to fix your goal, you should look at the amount of debt that you have. Let’s say you have $10,000 in credit card debt. Instead of simply wanting to live debt-free, you can say that you want to pay off your $10,000 credit card debt. That is a specific goal. Now how can you achieve it?  Measurable  “I will pay off some of my credit card debt each month until I am no longer in debt.” Do you see the problem with that plan? It is not measurable. Paying “some” money toward a credit card does less to hold you accountable than if you say, “I will pay $500 per month toward my credit card debt.” $500 per month is measurable, but does it meet the next requirement?  Achievable  Being able to pay $500 per month toward your credit card debt is great, but make sure that this goal is achievable. Take into account your income as well as your other expenses. If $500 per month interferes with your ability to pay rent or your electricity bill, you may need to adjust your goal amount to something more feasible. You should also be realistic in your time frame expectations. For example, “I want to pay off my $10,000 credit card debt in three months” might be too difficult a goal to achieve.  Relevant  Make sure that the goal is relevant to you and your lifestyle. If paying off your credit card is not important to you, you will probably not make this goal a priority, which sets you up for not meeting the goal.  Time-Bound  You can determine how long it will take to pay off your debt by dividing how much you owe by how much you will pay each month. How long will it take you to accomplish the goal of paying off $10,000 in credit card debt? If you pay $500 per month, it will take 20 months to completely pay off $10,000 of credit card debt. ($10,000/$500 = 20 months.) It is important for goals to have a time frame or deadline to keep you accountable and on track. Remember, the target time frame should be achievable.   Setting SMART goals is a good method for achieving whatever your goal may be. Remember to always make sure your goals are  S pecific,  M easurable,  A chievable,  R elevant, and  T ime-bound. This will help make your hopes into goals, and your goals into reality!  With hard work and commitment, you can achieve financial freedom! "} 
{"prompt":"What is Lifestyle Inflation?","completion":" Have you noticed that even when your income increases, it can feel like you still don’t have more money leftover at the end of the month? That’s because often, when our income increases, our expenses do too. This is a very real phenomenon called  lifestyle inflation . It can sneak up on us despite our best intentions to save.  Pent-Up Demand  Lifestyle inflation is often caused by something called pent-up demand. In other words, with your lower income, you were sacrificing something you wanted or needed in order to save for a specific goal (read more about  opportunity costs ) or because money is tight.  Now that you have a higher income, you start spending more money on that pent-up need. Consider these examples:  You get a raise and buy a new car that you’ve been needing for a while. You get a better-paying job and start eating out more because the job is more demanding and you have less time for shopping and cooking. After graduating from college, you get your first job. But you also start sending more money to support your family members who’ve helped you along the way.  Money Mindset  You want your higher income to get you closer to your overall financial goals, but your money mindset can get in the way. Sometimes when people are accustomed to struggling financially, they spend their way back to what feels comfortable.  Learn more about your money mindset with this video I made about  finding your money style .  How to Avoid Lifestyle Inflation  There are a lot of reasons that our expenses often increase as our income increases. So how do we avoid that?  The trick is to set short, intermediate, and long-term financial goals and hold yourself to them. Create a policy for yourself about what you will do with increased income. Make sure your goals are specific and measurable. For example, you may decide to automatically save 10% of any windfall or increase in salary.  As always, it’ll be easier to follow through on your goals if you know your “why.” Remembering your goal will help you stay on track when you have multiple financial priorities.  "} 
{"prompt":"“What credit card refinancing options do you recommend?”","completion":"What are some credit card debt refinancing options you recommend?  Submitted by anonymous.  My favorite approach to debt reduction is  a payment plan . It helps you reduce interest by paying the debt in a way that works within your budget. A payment plan also minimizes the risk of consolidating, which can incur additional debt.  If you decide that refinancing or consolidation are best for you, here are a few options to consider:    Balance transfer to a 0% rate card : This seems easy enough, but there are some factors that you should think about:  Are you opening a new credit account or using an existing card? New accounts impact your credit score, so think about this before taking this step.  Can you manage your spending and avoid increasing your overall debt? If you pay off one card by using another, how will you manage that “open” line of credit?    Consolidation loans : This can be a good choice, but watch those interest rates AND be sure you have a spending plan that helps you stay on track so you don’t continue to use the cards you paid off.  Home equity lines : This is NOT a good option. Credit card debt is “unsecured,” which means you don’t lose any collateral (an asset that the creditor can take if you don’t pay), but if you use a home equity line to consolidate, you put your home at risk by “securitizing” the debt.   Using a tool like this  debt reduction calculator  can help you find the best of both worlds: you can build a plan to reduce the debt without additional consequences or fees.  "} 
{"prompt":"How can I manage money with a partner who has different money habits?","completion":"Do you have any advice for managing money and budgets with a partner who has a different view of spending and saving than I do?  Submitted by anonymous.  Ah, love and money! This can be blissful or stressful. For many people, money can make or break your relationship. It is pretty common to partner with someone who has different perspectives about money. Opposites attract, right?  Talking about money  early  in a new relationship is the best way to put your cards (see what I did there?) on the table and figure out how you want to manage money as a couple. Money problems rank as one of the top 10 reasons for divorce, so having a money talk at any point in the relationship can save headache and heartache.  Here are some tips for having a productive, collaborative talk about money:   Start by finding a neutral place to have the conversation. Minimize distractions and create an environment that is comfortable for you both, like a coffee shop or park.  Agree to focus on your desired outcome rather than what the other is “doing wrong.”  Identify an area that you EACH would like to focus on and choose a goal. Where do you want to end up? For instance, if you’re both stressed about emergency savings, find a target amount you both want to save and discuss how you can work together.  Working with a financial coach  is also helpful if you find that you need an objective third party to help you build a roadmap.  Most importantly, listen to each other. Try to understand what is important to you as a couple and what approach is likely to get you there.  "} 
{"prompt":"If I Can Pay off My Debt, Is it Better for My Credit to Pay it off Slowly or All at Once?","completion":" I think I’m going to receive a large tax refund this year that could help me pay off my debts. If I’m able to pay off all of my debt, should I do it all at once or is it better for my credit to pay it off slowly over time?  Submitted by an anonymous SaverLife member  There are several factors that go into your credit score. A lot of the answer to this question depends on what is currently being reported. In general, if you can pay off all your debt, you should do it! There isn’t much better than being debt free and owing no one.  Now, before you pay off all your debt, if you don’t have a fully funded emergency fund, you should do that first. Have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a separate savings account for those rainy days that we all experience.  After this is done, then pay off your debt. If you are now unable to pay it all off, then you need to at least pay each credit line down to one third of its limit. For example, if you have a credit card with a $1,000 limit, pay it down to under $333. This will help your credit score. Do it for each card. How much you owe is the second highest contributing factor to your credit score.  Next, if you haven’t started this already, you have to make every remaining payment on time, each and every month. No exceptions. Your payment history is the biggest contributing factor to your credit score. The only way to change this is to start paying on time immediately. As the creditors begin to report your on-time payments, you will see an increase in your score, but again, this will take a while.  Now if you are lucky enough to be able to pay off all your debt  and  fund your emergency fund, then go ahead and do it. Lock up all but one of your cards in a lock box. The one you are keeping out, charge a monthly expense (such as gas or groceries) and then pay if off at the end of the month. This will keep your payment history building. "} 
{"prompt":"Why Do Different Companies Show Different Credit Scores?","completion":"Why do different companies show different credit scores? Credit Karma showed my score 70 points higher than the banks!  Submitted by StillLearning.  Ah, the mysteries of credit scores. Let’s get the nuts and bolts down, then we can talk about the best approach to getting the information you need. There are several credit reporting companies and they each use different calculations. The key to managing your credit score is to know the source of the information and your reason for tracking your score.  How Credit Scores Work  Let’s look at how your credit score works step by step.   Lenders report to one or more of the credit reporting companies, which are also called credit reporting bureaus (Experian, Equifax, Transunion).  The three bureaus keep their own reports of your payment history. They create their own score and report to  FICO  and  VantageScore .  Whew! Take a deep breath and check out this  infographic  that might help all of this make more sense.   Federal law requires that the three reporting bureaus provide you with a free  credit report  (a record of your borrowing and payment habits) every 12 months, but you often pay for your FICO score.  Credit scores  are big business because they are used to determine your eligibility for loans and what your interest rate will be. Low scores generally mean higher interest – YIKES!  There are some free credit scores that are often called “educational scores.” These are modified by the bureaus and offered through secondary sites like Credit Karma and Credit Sesame. These sites can be helpful if you are learning how to manage credit and they often have excellent tools to explain complex concepts. However, you may notice that the scores are not the same as FICO or VantageScore.  Pop Quiz  Read the following statement from the Credit Karma website and tell me why the score provided may differ from FICO.  “Credit Karma shows your scores from Equifax and TransUnion, calculated using VantageScore 3.0. It’s free and there’s no impact to your credit.”  (Cue Jeopardy music) YOU GUESSED IT! The score doesn’t reflect information from Experian.  Here are a few more things about your credit that you should know:   Checking your own credit report and score never impacts your credit score. So there is no reason to be wary of checking your score.  The “educational” scores often are from sites that want to sell you financial products. Be WARY of ads to upsell you from the “free” service.  Don’t count on free scores if you are planning to borrow money or apply for a mortgage or rental. Check your real credit reports for accuracy and pay for your FICO score so you know what to expect from a lender. The  Consumer Finance Protection Bureau  is a trusted resource for approved credit counseling agencies. The CFPB can help you obtain and review your credit reports. They can also help you create a plan to build credit or address problems with your credit history if necessary.   Take charge of your credit score by understanding how it works and what you need to do to verify accuracy and build a solid credit history.

{"prompt":"How to Balance Long-Term and Short-Term Savings Goals","completion":" We all know it’s important to save money. But how do you balance saving towards both your short-term and your long-term goals? I recommend creating a savings plan that takes your budget, goals, and timeframe into consideration. This can help you be successful in saving in both the short and long-term.  Define Your Goals  First, you must define your savings goals. Get specific! Write down two or three savings goals you have. Assign each goal a due date. This lets you distinguish between short-term goals, those you can reach in one to three years, and long-term goals which take more than three years. Also, write down why you want to achieve each goal. Be as clear as you can. Your “why” keeps you motivated.  Pick Your Savings Method   Next, you need to pick your saving methods. This can depend on the timeframe for your goals and also on your risk tolerance. For short-term goals where you will need the cash sooner or you want to have easier access to it, a  high-yield savings account  is a good choice. It lets you earn higher interest but also gives you quick access to your cash with no penalties or fees. For longer-term goals, you might consider savings vehicles that have a higher return, like  investment accounts . Or you may have a retirement account that your employer maintains. Always factor in when you’ll need the money and understand any taxes, fees, or penalties associated with the account you choose. There is also a lot of evidence to support having a separate account for each goal.  Know Your Budget  Now it’s time to figure out how much you can save each month. This means creating a budget. Review your spending for the last several months.  Determine how much money you need to meet your necessary expenses. Make sure to account for the bills you pay each month, your groceries, debt payments, and other expenses that you have to pay to get through the month.  Next, look at what’s left. This is where you will find money to save. Identify things you spend on each month that aren’t necessary. What can you cut? How much you cut depends on how much you want to save and how hard you want to hit your goals. It can be helpful to not allocate every spare dollar to savings and keep some “fun money” in your budget. This helps you stay on track and not feel so limited. Identify how much you can comfortably eliminate and remember you don’t have to cut out discretionary expenses entirely. Just cutting back can help you save.  Divide Your Savings Between Goals  Now you need to divide your savings between your goals. Using the goal completion dates you wrote down, determine how many months you have to reach each goals. Divide the total savings you need by the number of months until you want to complete each goal. This will give you how much you need to save monthly to reach your goal. Now divide up your monthly savings between each goal using how much you have to save towards each goal.    If you don’t have enough to fully fund each goal, you’ll have to prioritize. Some goals, like an emergency fund, are time-sensitive. Other goals, like saving for retirement, may need to be prioritized in order to take advantage of an employer match. Think about the goals that you have written down and how achieving each one reflects your values and changes your overall financial picture. Fully fund your top priority and allocate any unused savings towards your next priority. Once you reach your top priority you can add those savings to your next goal to achieve it sooner.  Track Your Progress   Now that you have a savings plan in place, you’ll want to track your progress. Whether you use a pen and paper, Excel, or an app, be sure to record your monthly savings towards each goal. This will help keep you motivated!  Repeat the Process  Setting savings goals isn’t a one-time thing. As things change, you’ll need to repeat the process. And as you achieve your short-term savings goals, you’ll want to start the process over and set new goals or save more towards your existing goals. No matter what, be sure to celebrate your wins and milestones along the way! Acknowledging your achievements will help keep you motivated going forward. "} 
{"prompt":"What’s the Best Way to Pay Off Debt?","completion":" There are a couple of ways to get out of debt and back on track with your finances. Let’s walk through some straightforward steps together!  Start with Budgeting Basics  To start with, make a budget. Total up all your monthly take home pay. Next, start to subtract all of your expenses. You will want to subtract your housing, car, gas, food, entertainment, clothing, insurance just to name a few. Be thorough and honest about your spending. Once you’ve subtracted everything, hopefully you have a positive number. If not, you need to go through all your expenses and decide where you can cut back until you do have a positive number.  Doing this will allow you to free up extra money to put toward your debt, and will also keep you from going further into debt.  Non-Profit Credit Counseling  One option is to work with a non-profit credit counseling agency. They will negotiate lower payments, a lower interest rate, or both with each of your creditors. From there, you pay them a small monthly fee along with the total new monthly payments and they make your payments for you.  This can be extremely helpful if you are feeling overwhelmed, are receiving phone calls, or can’t get out from under the debt due to huge interest rates.  To learn more, find a legitimate  credit counseling agency .   Debt Reduction Plan  Another option is to set up your own debt reduction plan. You can do this easily using a tool I like called  PowerPay . It’s a free website. You will put in all your debts, including the dollar amounts, interest rates, and minimum payments.  You will have also put in how much extra you can pay each month. This is where your budget comes in handy! Even if it’s a small amount, it will make difference. The website will then calculate how long it will take you to get out of debt, and even print you a calendar showing how much to pay on each debt, each month.  (The directions for this site are on the homepage, on the right-hand side.)  Finding the Right Plan for You  The difference between the two programs is that with PowerPay, you still make the monthly payments, the interest rate stays the same, and the cards remain open. When using a Debt Management Program through a credit counseling agency, you make a payment to the agency and they pay your creditors each month. The interest rates are lowered but the cards will close.  You can also use a combination of both of these plans if there are cards you want to remain open, but others you want to close.    ***  The burden of debt can be overwhelming. Making a plan to tackle this debt can help lower your stress and allow you to see a way out. With a little hard work, you can be debt free. "} 
{"prompt":"How much should I save before I buy a house?","completion":" Buying a home is a big life decision. One of the questions that will come up is how much you should save before starting the home buying process. Here’s how to answer that question.  Buying vs. renting a home  The first step is to make sure that you’re buying a home for the right reasons. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that  renting is “throwing money away.”  Although you build equity in the property over time when you own your home, most of your  mortgage  payments in the beginning  go to interest .   In order for buying a home to be a financially beneficial decision, you should plan to stay in the home for at least five years. That’s why it’s important to consider the possibility of life changes. How secure are your current job and salary? How long are you planning to stay in your area?   One way to look at a rental payment is that you are buying flexibility. If you need to move across the country for family reasons or for an amazing career opportunity, you won’t be tethered to a property. This  New York Times calculator  can help you weigh the tradeoffs of buying vs renting.  What can you afford?  The next step is to calculate how much home you can afford to buy using a  home buying calculator . Don’t forget to factor in costs such as homeowner’s insurance, HOA fees, and maintenance. I usually recommend that my clients refrain from buying the most expensive house they can afford (you probably won’t hear that from lenders and realtors!). It’s important to leave room for increasing expenses in other areas, especially expenses related to family and children.  Saving for your down payment  Many mortgages require a 20% down payment. This means that you are effectively borrowing 80% of the home’s value and paying for the rest outright.  Now that you know your price range, ask yourself how long it would take you to save for a 20% down payment. If it would take longer than you’d like, consider purchasing a less expensive home. Keep in mind, especially if this is your first home purchase, this may not be your forever home. In fact, if the value of your home holds steady or increases, you can use the sale proceeds to help you buy a more expensive home. Another route to consider would be  first-time home buyer programs  and other promotional loans (vary by lender). These loans require down payments as low as 3.5% or no down payment at all. Keep in mind that these loans come with a higher interest rate, a larger mortgage payment (because the interest rate is higher and you are borrowing more of the home’s value), and the cost of  private mortgage insurance (PMI) . A low down payment also leaves you more vulnerable to the real estate market. If the value of the home were to fall, then you would immediately be “underwater.”  Other fees and expenses  Once you know how much you need for the down payment, make sure you set aside enough money for home inspection fees and due diligence (anywhere between $500 and $2,000) and closing costs (2% to 5% of the purchase price). It’s also important to have at least six months of expenses saved in your emergency fund. An emergency fund is even more important when you’re a homeowner, because if your appliances need to be fixed or replaced, there’s no calling the landlord. You own the property, so you have to pay the expense yourself.   Happy home buying! "} 
{"prompt":"Should I Save If I’m in Debt?","completion":" Saving money is important. Saving might seem difficult, especially if you are struggling to make ends meet or if you are in debt. However, everyone can create a savings plan. Even as you work toward paying off debt, saving is necessary and possible. If you put all of your money toward debt, you won’t be able to handle everyday financial challenges. No matter your circumstances, saving for your future should be a priority.  Why Should I Save?  People create savings plans for different reasons. Here are some common reasons why people save even if they’re in debt:  Emergencies  – Emergencies are those unexpected expenses that, without a savings plan, can be detrimental to your finances. A car or household appliance may need repairs; you or someone in your household may need medical treatment. In times like these, having some money already set aside in an emergency fund is a big help. Your emergency fund may start out small, with a goal of $300 – $500. Once you reach that goal, you can increase your goal to $1,000.  Loss of income  – Sometimes unexpected events occur that result in a loss of income. Someone in your household may get laid off, or a job where income fluctuates may go through a low period. In this case, it’s helpful to have a reserve fund set aside. Try to set aside enough money to be able to cover a few months of expenses to give yourself time to regain a source of income.  Monthly or annual expenses – You may also benefit from saving for recurring expenses. Monthly expenses like utility bills or rent, and annual expenses like school supplies or holiday shopping, can be included in your savings plan. In these cases, the money you set aside will  only  go to these specific expenses that you expect to recur every month, year, or quarter. Personal goals  – It is great to strive toward personal goals. You may be eyeing a new television or car, or a family trip. Even if you can’t make those big purchases right away, setting money aside will help you make those purchases in the future.  How to Save   There can be obstacles to saving. You do not have to set aside large amounts of money at a time. You can start small and add to your savings as time goes on. It’s important to get into a habit of saving.!  Save a percentage of every dollar that comes into your household. This will add up in the long run.  Decrease your spending. Lower your cable service. Lower your phone service. Cancel a membership or subscription to a service that you do not use often. Eat out less. Choose less expensive brands of products. You can then set aside the money that used to go to these other costs. Increase your income. You may be able to get a second job or work some overtime. Sometimes extra income is unexpected. For example, you may get a bonus at work or a large tax refund. Instead of using the extra income as extra spending money, or even putting all of the money toward your debt, it is a good idea to set aside some of the money in an emergency or reserve fund.  Where to Save  Once you have money to save, it is a good idea to designate a place to put that money. I recommend storing your savings separate from your spending money so you are not tempted to spend it. You can open a savings account with your bank or even a separate bank. You can have separate accounts for emergencies, expenses, and personal goals. Make sure you know your bank’s policies and possible fees associated with a new account. Some people put their savings onto a prepaid card. Again, carefully read your card’s policies and fees if you choose this option.   Even though it may seem difficult, setting money aside for the future is important and possible. There are many reasons and methods when it comes to saving. Find what works best for you.

{"prompt":"New Years Anti-Resolutions for 2020","completion":" I’m going to suggest something a little radical for the new year and the new decade, 2020. Instead of focusing on a new year’s resolutions, consider listing the things you are going to  stop  doing. Ideally, these should be self-sabotaging habits and behaviors that prevent you from achieving your goals.  Here are a few ideas to get you started:  1. Let Go of Unsupportive People  You will stop (or reduce) your communications with unsupportive people. Anyone who truly cares about you also cares about what’s important to you, including your goals. Beware of people who discourage you from sticking to your goals. I genuinely believe this is why the “unfollow” button and the ability to send calls straight to voicemail exist. Be intentional with who you invite into your life. There are amazing private Facebook groups with people trying to achieve your goals; join one. Find a local support group, a Bible study group, your group of people. I like to call these your “battle buddies.” These are people with shared goals and similar struggles. You can encourage each other.  2. Break Up With Your Credit Card  You will stop buying items with a credit card. It’s tough to pay off credit debt when you are still using a credit card. You tend to spend, on average, 25% more when you use a credit card instead of cash. Consider committing to using your debit card for expenses and using only cash in areas you typically overspend in (eating out, groceries, clothing, etc.).  3. Stop De-Prioritizing Saving  You will stop putting savings at the bottom of your to-do list. Putting money into your savings should be at the top of your spending plan. There will never be a good time to start saving. Consider using payroll deductions to have a portion of your paycheck go directly into your savings account, so you don’t have to think about it. Remember, it’s more about the habit of saving first rather than the actual amount you save.  4. Never Shop Without a List  You will stop going to the grocery store without a shopping list. I have never heard of anyone who considers a trip to the grocery store to be a stress-reducing experience. It’s crowded, overwhelming, and no matter what time you go, it’s an inconvenience. First, shop your pantry and refrigerator. I cannot tell you how many times I bought something I already had, or I already had all the ingredients for a meal. Next, think through the meals you want to make. You can easily find budget-friendly meals online. You don’t have to get fancy. Start with a few quick meals like spaghetti or hamburgers. The point is to limit your meals out.  Hopefully this gets you thinking about what you may need to stop doing in 2020. Take the time for a little self-reflection and commit to stopping self-sabotaging habits. This can go a long way to helping you reach your goals! "} 
{"prompt":"How do I know what is a “need” and what is a “want”?","completion":" Just seeing the word “budget” can give some people a headache. Instead of reaching for a bottle of aspirin, I suggest changing the way you think of a budget.   A budget is a tool that helps you use money so that you reach your goals. You control what you spend money on and how much money you spend. A vital part of a budget is getting clear on what is a need vs. what is a want.  The difference between a “need” and a “want”  Need : Spending that is essential to you being able to survive. Necessary spending includes basic food, a place to live, transportation to take you to work, insurance, and essential clothing.   Want : Spending based on a desire for something that is not essential to survival. This includes cable, gym memberships, eating out, entertainment, travel, and designer clothes.  It sounds easy, but it gets hard when we use this to purchase an essential item, then justify upgrading the purchase way above the amount needed to meet our basic needs. Below are a few examples.  Is a car a “need” or a “want”?  Should you purchase a new vehicle with upgrades that use nearly half of your take-home income, or should you buy a slightly used car with no upgrades? Also, some areas have excellent public transit. Having a car may be a “want” if you can get to work, school, and buy essential items like groceries without a car. In this case, the car is a convenience that is a want, not a need. If your car breaks down due to normal “wear and tear” repairs in your owner’s manual, can you fix it instead of buying a new car?  Is my house or apartment a “need” or a “want”?  Generally I would consider your house or apartment to be a “need.” After all, we need shelter to live. But you may classify it as a “want” if you are:  Buying a home when you can barely pay your bills and don’t have savings Renting an apartment with extra space for, even though you rarely have guests over Paying more in rent so you can live in the trendiest area that’s close to everything, instead of choosing a safe but cheaper apartment  What food is a “need” versus a “want”?  Food is also certainly a “need.” But that doesn’t mean that all food is a “need”! Here are a few examples that come to mine for me:  Not having a meal ready when you are hungry or busy does not turn eating out into an essential expense If you are on a tight food budget, the more convenient the food item (pre-cut veggies, pre-bagged, pre-cut chicken, etc.), the more expensive the cost. It shifts the food from a need to want because you can buy a cheaper option.  Are my clothing and travel a “need” or a “want”?  Needing a bag for your laptop does not justify buying a Coach bag. Likewise, I certainly want you to take a break from work, but not if it means going into debt. You can do a “staycation” in your area!  ***  Separating your needs from your wants allows you to create a spending plan based on the most important things to you. Maybe if you drove a cheaper car, you may be able to afford your dream vacation.   Every financial decision you make, no matter how small, will either get you closer to your goals or become a barrier to reaching your goals. Understanding needs and wants can help you prioritize how you spend so that you can reach your financial goals. "} 
{"prompt":"Three Calming Strategies for Managing Money Anxiety","completion":"Mo’ money, mo’ problems?  It’s one thing for The Notorious B.I.G. to say, but if you’re experiencing financial stress in your daily life, you’re not likely to agree. When you feel like you can’t make ends meet, it may seem like money is the cause of (and solution to) all your challenges.  Here are a few things you can do when money has you stressed out:  1. Stop and Breathe  I know breathing seems like a no-brainer, but think about how often you find yourself holding your breath when you’re feeling stressed out. Attempting to find your way forward when you are feeling overwhelmed may actually hinder your progress. Developing a  healthier response to stress  can help you manage financial anxiety and more accurately assess your options.  2. Be Mindful  Notice when stress has a grip on you and increase activities that soothe or calm you. Meditation, playing music, or talking with trusted friends can give you the mental space and encouragement to treat yourself kindly. Think about how you would respond to a loved one who was struggling with money, and show yourself that same kindness. As always, there’s an app for that, so if you need some support, check out  mindfulness apps  for your computer or phone.  3. Focus on the Future  Recognize that financial challenges are generally a combination of internal (things you can do) and external (economic or environmental) events. So place your attention on what you CAN control. Abusing yourself with thoughts of what you “shoulda, woulda, coulda” done is just a recipe for more anxiety. Remember the “no shame zone” and be gentle with yourself as you identify what actions you want to take.  Financial distress is one of the most common stressors, so learning how to deal with the stress is often the first step to finding your way to financial wellness. "} 
{"prompt":"Buying a house seems unattainable for me. What can I do?","completion":"“Thanks you for your blog and articles to educate oneself. I hear a lots about affordable housing, which concerns me because the prices on these houses are still not attainable for people like me. I want to buy a home with the Habitat for Humanity program. Can you give insight on what it takes to own a home? Thank you.”   Submitted by Josephine D.  Home ownership can seem unachievable when you look at the cost of housing in many areas. Fortunately, there are several programs like Habitat For Humanity that can help you build a financial foundation (see what I did there?) and create a path to owning your own home.  There are a few basics steps that anyone seeking to purchase a home must complete. When money is tight and buying a home seems out of reach, a good first step is to learn about the homeownership programs in your immediate area (or in another locale if you are considering moving to a new city or town).  The Housing and Urban Development Office (HUD) has a list of  HUD-sponsored housing counseling services  across the U.S. A HUD housing counselor will be able to tell you about federal and local programs that are available and can often determine your eligibility by asking a few questions about your financial situation and family size.  It is easy to look at all of the steps and become overwhelmed or discouraged, so don’t start with a list. Start with a call. Get the information that is relevant to your specific circumstance and learn what you would have to do to achieve your goal. With good planning and the support of a program like Habitat or others, your goal may be closer than you think. "} 
{"prompt":"What are the Metal Levels in Marketplace Insurance?","completion":" When you start planning for Open Enrollment, your first question may be which metal level of health coverage is right for you. Health insurance plans in the  Marketplace  fall into  four metal-level tiers : Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze. These metal levels reflect the differences in how costs for your healthcare are split between you and your insurance company. Generally speaking, plans with higher premiums have lower annual deductibles. And plans with lower monthly premiums tend to come with high deductibles. Depending on the amount of medical costs you end up with in a year, different metal levels will offer different kinds of value to you.   The different metal tiers in no way reflect a difference in the level of care you receive.   Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, all Marketplace plans must cover the following 10 categories of  Essential Health Benefits :  Ambulatory patient services (outpatient care you get without being admitted to a hospital) Emergency services Hospitalization (like surgery and overnight stays) Pregnancy, maternity, and newborn care  (both before and after birth) Mental health and substance use disorder services , including behavioral health treatment (this includes counseling and psychotherapy) Prescription drugs Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices (services and devices to help people with injuries, disabilities, or chronic conditions gain or recover mental and physical skills) Laboratory services Preventive and wellness services  and chronic disease management Pediatric services, including oral and vision care (but adult dental and vision coverage aren’t essential health benefits)  No matter which plan type you select, all Marketplace plans are Qualified Health Plans. And these plans must offer a  set of preventive care services  – including many vaccinations, cancer screenings, and birth control – for free when you visit an in-network healthcare provider, even if you haven’t met your deductible yet.

{"prompt":"Cut Your Expenses with a Savings Scavenger Hunt!","completion":"If you review your spending over the last month, you can almost certainly find one regular expense you can reduce. Then you can put the money toward savings instead. Grab a snack, put on some good music, and get your bank and credit card statements from last month (go ahead, we’ll wait)…  Okay, scan through the statements and categorize the things you spend money on each month. Start with broad categories like “living expenses” (what you must pay) and “lifestyle expenses” (what you spend to enjoy life more). Once you do that, focus on a monthly expense that you want to tackle. It doesn’t matter which category. Just pick something that you will reduce consistently.  Now you’ve chosen a category to reduce, it’s time to brainstorm. Think about what changes you want to make. For instance, if you want to reduce your restaurant spending, first think about what is important to you about eating out. Is it the meal itself, or is there more to it? When you eat out, are you alone or with other people? If you reduced this expense, how would you get that need met? Having a plan for the change you want to make will help you be more consistent.  There are only three things you can do if you want to change your financial life: make more, spend less, or a combination of the two. Remember, there’s no judgment. Just align your spending with what matters most.  Will you pledge to do a one-month savings bump based on your scavenger hunt? "} 
{"prompt":"Guide to Filing Taxes as an Independent Contractor","completion":" New to being an independent contractor? Here’s what you need to know about taxes.  Being an independent contractor or gig worker comes with more flexibility. It also comes with new tax responsibilities.  At a high level, the IRS considers you an independent contractor, and therefore self-employed. You are paid for the result of your work, not for how or when you do it. The “self-employed” status generally translates into higher tax rates and more cumbersome tax filing. But it also generates some potential new tax deductions.  Let’s walk through some things you need to know about taxes as an independent contractor.  You’ll be paying a new tax: self-employment tax  If you’re self-employed, you pay self-employment tax (approximately 15% of your net business income) and federal income tax directly to the IRS. The self-employment tax includes Social Security and Medicare taxes. This generally means that you’ll pay a higher tax rate.  Quarterly estimated tax payments  You probably need to make quarterly tax payments to the IRS. This is especially important if you believe you’ll owe more than $1,000 in income tax when you file. These payments represent an estimate of what you will owe in taxes for a given year based on your projected income and deductions. They are typically due to the IRS on April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15. These payments can be a big burden for new contractors, as you are now responsible for withholding your own taxes on income and paying them at the appropriate times. It’s important to pay throughout the year so you don’t end up short on cash or with a tax penalty at tax time.  The IRS has more information on  determining and paying your quarterly estimated tax payments .  New tax forms  You’ll generally receive and use new tax forms. As an independent contractor, you need to file your own business taxes on Form 1040 (the standard tax return). You’ll use a Schedule C to report income and expenses and a Schedule SE to determine your self-employment tax. You may need to fill out new state and local tax forms as well.  Whenever you receive $400 or more of income, you should receive a Form 1099 (instead of a W-2 for employees) at tax time that you must report when filing your income taxes. However, you may not always receive official tax forms to track your income. You are still liable to report all of your income, so you’ll need to keep your own records. See the  IRS’s Tax Guide for Small Business  for more information on federal tax laws and the self-employed.  Tracking your income and documenting your expenses  Being self-employed requires a lot of organization and documentation. You need to set up financial systems for tracking your income, documenting your expenses, regularly setting aside money for taxes, and paying your estimated tax bills on time.  You may start with a simple Excel spreadsheet for tracking your business finances. If it’s getting too complicated, consider budgeting software like QuickBooks or Quicken or expense trackers like Expensify or Stride. Carefully track your expenses to maximize your eligible tax deduction and minimize your tax liability.   From the start, establish a separate savings account for your taxes. Set aside at least 20% of your income in that account to be able to pay your taxes on time and in full.  Business-related deductions  You may be able to get some new tax breaks from business-related deductions to reduce your federal income tax obligation. Along with the new tax responsibilities of being an independent contractor come a few tax benefits. Namely, expenses that might otherwise be considered “personal” can be deducted as business expenses. These include services, items, or amenities you use for business purposes. Some common examples are phone and internet, office supplies, use of your personal vehicle, a portion of rent, certain meals, and health insurance.  Business deductions effectively reduce your business’s taxable income and could lower how much you owe in federal income tax. But deductions have their limits. To understand the rules of deducting business expenses, see this  guide from the IRS .  Is an accountant right for you?  You may want to hire an accountant to protect yourself. A certified public accountant will understand how federal taxes work. They can help you manage your new responsibilities, avoid costly mistakes and tax problems, take advantage of available deductions, make filing your taxes easier, decrease your overall tax liability, and safeguard the health and longevity of your business. While an accountant is an extra cost, it can also provide peace of mind and might be a worthwhile expense.  Saving for retirement  When you are feeling established as an independent contractor, consider starting a retirement account. Self-employed people have some unique options when it comes to retirement savings that aren’t available to employees. A SEP-IRA is one option. It allows self-employed people to set aside significantly more than in other accounts, providing you with deductions on your tax return while building your retirement savings. It’s wise to consult a financial planning professional before making investment decisions. I would recommend a  fee-only advisor  (who is compensated directly by you for advice).  More resources for independent contractors  For more information, the IRS has online tax centers on its website for  small businesses and the self-employed  and  those working in the gig economy .

{"prompt":"Do you recommend credit consolidation?","completion":" Do you recommend credit consolidation to improve scores and decrease debt?  Submitted by Natasha P.  There are two parts to this question, so let’s dig into them separately.  Improving Your Credit Score  Whenever a financial institution pulls your credit with the purpose of offering you a loan, your score may be affected. Closing a credit line, especially a well-established line, can also impact your score.  If you are consolidating a lot of credit cards or other debt into one or a couple of lines it can become more manageable and easier to not miss a payment, possibly improving your score. However, you could end up with a higher interest rate and the terms of consolidation often require you to close the other accounts. You can see that there are several things to consider.  Decreasing Your Debt  As for consolidating debt to decrease debt, consolidation doesn’t make the amount you owe disappear. It may make it more manageable to pay off depending on your budget, interest rate, and what your monthly payment would be. I’d first take a look at your spending habits, create a budget, and see where you could possibly bring in more money to help pay off the debt. If the habits that got you into racking up this debt are still in place, you’d be hard-pressed to see much change with or without debt consolidation.  If you do decide to consolidate debt, you’ll want to take three factors into consideration:  What is your primary objective?  Do you want to lower your interest rates overall, lower your monthly payments, or minimize the number of open accounts? Of course, the lower the rate, the less money you will pay in interest over the life of the loan. Most loans with collateral (ex. car, house, or savings account) will have a lower interest rate than unsecured loans. How much can you pay per month?  The more you can afford, the quicker the loan is paid, and less interest will accrue. What is your time frame to get out of debt?  By reorganizing debt and changing the type of debt and how much you owe per month, you can free up funds in your budget to pay off all of your debts quicker and maybe even jumpstart your savings.  Every situation is unique and debt consolidation is not always the right choice. Credit unions are my favorite resource for consolidation loans. By evaluating your current spending habits and considering the three questions mentioned above, you can come to the decision that will be best for you. "} 
{"prompt":"How do you get out of an upside down car loan?","completion":" How do you get out of an upside down car loan when you have bad credit and no one is willing to refinance?  Submitted by Nichole B.  You have touched on a hot button for me! In the early 90s, I had a car that was so upside down my grandchildren would be paying the loan. I’d had a few years of no income while I was in school and my credit was trashed.  The fact is, there are no great options. Once there is negative equity (meaning you loan is more than the value of your car) on a vehicle, it doesn’t go away.   Option 1: Ride It Out  For the most part, you will have to tough it out until you can pay the car down enough to get rid of the negative equity. Once you pay the car down, it will be much easier to find a lender who is willing to refinance, hopefully at a lower interest rate.  Option 2: Trade in the Car  The other option would be to trade in the car for a different vehicle. This option, more often than not, can create even more negative equity (making you more upside down), so you have to be patient. Choose a car that will outlast the new loan and find a “smokin’ deal.” This is most commonly called a “rollover” and your lender may be able to lower your interest rate/ monthly payment. You’ll still be on the hook for what you owed in the previous loan because the old loan is “rolled” into the new loan.  Here’s the bright side. I found a deal on a car that I could count on for years to come. I bought that new car and my interest rate was outrageous. The price was nearly twice the amount the car would cost if I wasn’t upside down. In two years, I refinanced with a credit union (yep… you know me!) and got a great rate. I paid off that car and am still driving it today.  In the short run, that was a very painful financial situation that I turned into a good situation. My car has more than 350,000 miles on it and I haven’t paid a car note in 10 years.  Financial mistakes are not fatal.  Learn the lesson and make choices that are in alignment with your long term goals.  Photo by  Peter Fazekas  from  Pexels "} 
{"prompt":"Saving for College","completion":"   Graduation celebrations are all around us. I think this is a wonderful time to think about what college savings means in your life and for your family.  Find your “why”  As exciting as college can be, the financial burden is often high. So take some time now to think about your motivations. Are you saving for your own education, or for a child or grandchild? What are your long-term goals (for yourself or others) and how does college fit in? These questions may seem obvious, but thinking about them ahead of time will help you motivate yourself as well as choose the right college and field of study.  How much time do you have?  Saving for the future begins with the  time horizon , which is the amount of time you have to save. Over this period of time, you’ll be adding to your savings, but that money should also be working as hard as you are by earning interest on what you put in.  Your time horizon can help you determine what approach you should take to investing. Do you want to be conservative, moderate, or aggressive in your investments? For example, if you’re saving for your 5-year-old to go to college, you can be more aggressive with your investments than if you were saving for a 15-year-old to go to college.  How does saving fit into your plan to pay for college?  Paying for college entirely with savings would be great, but the reality is that most people use a combination of sources to pay for college, including savings, private student loans, federal student loans, scholarships, and grants. There are lots of options and you can potentially avoid a lot of debt through  a combination of other sources .  Now, how are you going to make it happen?  Even if your priority is saving for college, you’ll always have competing financial needs, including an emergency fund, expenses, and other goals. So now you need to figure out how your budget can support your priorities.   Create a budget and determine how much you can set aside consistently  Decide which type of account you want to save in. A few options are 529 accounts (Children’s Savings Accounts), Roth (retirement), or regular savings. Each option has strengths and weaknesses.  Save, monitor, and evaluate your progress regularly.

{"prompt":"Where Do You Apply for a Marketplace Plan?","completion":" There are several ways you can apply for a  Marketplace  health insurance plan. During Open Enrollment, you can shop, compare, and apply directly through  HealthCare.gov . However, some states have created their own “State Based Marketplace” or “exchange.” If you live in  a state that runs their own Marketplace , you can enroll directly through their site.  You can also enroll through a secure and trusted partner of HealthCare.gov, like  HealthSherpa . HealthSherpa offers the same plans and prices with no extra costs. Plus, HealthSherpa was the very first company approved to have the entire enrollment experience on their own site. It makes the enrollment process much easier and more streamlined for anyone looking to shop for an Obamacare plan. If you want extra help, the HealthSherpa Consumer Advocate team can walk you through the process over the phone.  If you don’t have access to a phone or computer, you can submit a paper application. You’ll receive your eligibility results in up to two weeks, and then begin your enrollment process.  Don’t forget that not everyone who sells health insurance online offers Marketplace insurance. So if you choose to buy your insurance online but not through HealthCare.gov, make sure you use a trusted partner like HealthSherpa to ensure that you are buying a Marketplace plan. Some sellers might only offer short-term plans that come with low premiums, and also cover very little in terms of preventive care, pre-existing conditions, and the kinds of essential health benefits guaranteed by Marketplace plans.

{"prompt":"What You Need to Know about Unemployment Benefits","completion":"If you lose your job, there are resources out there to help you stay afloat financially as you plan your next steps forward.  Eligibility and Applications  Unemployment benefits and eligibility requirements vary state-to-state, so  choose your state  to start the process of checking your eligibility and applying for benefits. Generally, unemployment benefits are available to workers who become unemployed “through no fault of their own” – which means that you may not be eligible if you were fired for cause or if you quit your job.  Other Related Benefits  Unemployment insurance is just one of the  benefits that you may be eligible for . To continue your group health insurance after leaving a job, you can enroll in COBRA continuation coverage. And if illness or injury prevents you from working, you can apply for short-term or long-term disability insurance.  Should I Apply?  If you believe you are eligible for unemployment benefits, but feel reluctant to apply, I encourage you to think about why you feel this way. Are you holding shame about being unemployed? It may be helpful to talk to someone you trust who can support you in applying for the benefits you’re eligible to receive.  Take Action Now  Losing a job is a big event, and you may feel frightened or uncertain about the future. Acknowledge and deal with the emotions you’re experiencing. If you need support, talk to a trusted friend.  As you figure out your next steps forward, address your budget now and make any necessary changes. Pay for necessities and contact your creditors if you need to.  Don’t agree to pay more than you can afford  and  seek out any public benefits  that you’re eligible for.  If you believe you are eligible for a benefit, be prepared to challenge if your claim is rejected.  Plan Your Transition  We all have transitions, so take this time to consider your vision for the next three months, six months, and beyond. What milestones do you hope to accomplish at these intervals?  Here are a few more questions I want you to think through:   What job-seeking requirements must you fulfill to be eligible for unemployment benefits?  What information or resources do you need?  How will you stay motivated through this transition period?  What will you do if or when you are no longer eligible for benefits?   Remember that bumps along your professional journey are seldom your final destination. Set realistic expectations for yourself given the economic and unemployment conditions in your geographic area and field. Then get the support you need and keep yourself on track. I’m rooting for you! "} 
{"prompt":"What is the Standard Deduction?","completion":" The standard deduction is the amount of income you get to deduct from your total taxable income. Because the standard deduction lowers your taxable income, it means you pay less income tax.   In 2019, the standard deduction for someone filing as single is $12,200. For a Head of Household, the standard deduction is $18,350. And for married couples, the standard deduction is $24,400.  For example, let’s say you are single, and in 2019 your total taxable, earned income was $48,000. That is the amount your employer will report to the IRS.   When you file your taxes, you report the same amount, but then you get to deduct $12,200 from the $48,000. Now the amount you pay taxes on is $35,800. You would go to the IRS tax table for the year 2019 (this table is currently still a draft on the IRS website) and it will tell you that in 2019, the total tax due on $35,800 (your new taxable income amount) is $4,129.00. If you didn’t have the standard deduction, the total tax due on $48,000 would have been $6,424.    Because of the standard deduction, your tax liability decreased by $2,295. That’s money that you don’t have to pay to the IRS! "} 
{"prompt":"How to Prepare for Tax Season with Tax-Savvy Financial Moves","completion":"It’s the beginning of the year, which means (among other things) that tax season is approaching. This year especially brings a lot of uncertainty with new tax regulations.  Here are a few things you can do now to make tax season a breeze.  Check how changes in tax laws will affect you  Tax law changes frequently, and this past year brought a lot of big changes. Before you panic, know the facts and how they affect you.  This article  is a good place to start. There’s a lot of detail, so focus your attention on these issues that I pulled from the article and the IRS website because I want your life to be easier (you’re welcome):   Reduced tax rates – The 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered U.S. tax rates. While the number of tax brackets remained at seven, the rates were lowered and the income thresholds were increased (mostly for high income earners).  Taxpayers can choose between using the standard deduction or itemized deductions. Itemizing deductions means adding up all of the individual tax deductions to which you’re entitled and then subtracting them from your adjusted gross income (AGI). (Note: Adjusted gross income is your total income minus a few adjustments. Common adjustments to income include traditional IRA contributions and student loan interest, just to name a few.)  Elimination of personal exemptions – this makes me sad, but we will see what happens with these changes:  Increased standard deductions: $12,000 for singles, $18,000 for heads of households and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly  Increased child tax credit: $2,000 per qualifying child and a new $500 credit for other qualifying dependents  Changes to itemized deductions     The  IRS website has a calculator  so you can do a “paycheck check up” to see if you are withholding the right amount for your situation. That won’t help much for this year but you can get a jump on next year planning by checking out your withholding on your W-4 (yes, you can change it).  Reach out for reliable help  Each person and situation is different, so if you have questions, you may need to consult a professional to find the answer.

{"prompt":"How can I save on a fixed income and disability?","completion":" The key to saving is quite simply, to spend less than you make. This works for all incomes, whether it’s from a job, retirement, or government benefits like disability.  If you are spending everything that you have each month, then consider checking your spending for a leak in your wallet. When I say “leak,” I mean those little things you occasionally buy, that you justify because “it’s just a few bucks.”  Start by going to your bank account and get a 30-day history. Every time money came out of your account, put it under its specific category. You will have food, eating out, and gas, just to name a few. Once you have done this for the entire 30 days, add up each category. Is there one that surprised you? Does your spending match what is on your budget sheet?    If not, you have some changes to make. But now that you know where your leak is, you can fix it. Instead of buying a coffee every day, make your own. Maybe you could set up a car pool if your gas is more than you thought. Is the eating out category too high? Make more meals at home. Whatever your leak is, start to make changes to plug it, and start putting the extra money into your savings.  Even if its only $5 a week, that $5 will make a difference. Before you know it, that small savings will grow to be $100, and then $200. Every time you spend money, ask yourself, “Is this necessary or could I be putting this money into my savings account?” Those little savings will add up just as quickly as those little purchases will. The difference is, one works for you and one works against you.   "} 
{"prompt":"“Pay Yourself First” – Your Savings Mantra","completion":"Focus on You. Pay Yourself First.  Have you ever thought, “I’ll pay all of my bills and save what’s left”? Well, how much was left? When we wait to save until the end of the month, we usually learn that we have more month than money and there is nothing left. We challenge you to commit to paying yourself first.  “Pay yourself first.” We hear it all the time, but what does it really mean? Most of us have thought about saving more or saving more regularly, but how many of us really save before paying our bills?  A Habit of Saving  Paying yourself first means that before you pay anyone else, including essential living expenses, put money in your savings account. This really is the “golden rule” of personal finance.  The amount you save isn’t as important as the habit you create.  The Power of Automatic Transfers  Make saving your priority by setting up an automatic transfer each month. An automatic transfer to your savings account is a perfect way to create a habit of saving AND put yourself first in your financial life. For example, you can set up with your bank an automated weekly transfer of $5 every week to your savings account.  To learn more about what it means to pay yourself first,  check out this video . "} 
{"prompt":"How do tax write-offs work?","completion":" We all know the saying: “There are two certainties in life: death and taxes.” Since taxes are one of our largest ongoing expenses, we’re all interested in keeping them as low as possible. Fortunately, the government has created tax breaks in order to incentive citizens to do things it considers valuable to society.  For example, the government wants people to buy homes, have children, donate to charity, and start businesses. Thus, the government established the mortgage interest deduction, child tax credit, and charitable deduction, and all business expenses are deductible against business income.  It’s important to be aware of these tax benefits when making decisions. Any money that doesn’t go to taxes can be put toward your other financial goals.  How tax deductions work  You can subtract tax deductible expenses from your taxable income. Since your taxable income is lower, you could pay less taxes.  Let’s assume a married couple is in the 12%  tax bracket  (combined income between $19,750 and $80,250). A $1,000 tax-deductible expense would lower their taxable income by $1,000. Since the couple wouldn’t owe taxes on that $1,000 of income, they would save $120 in taxes (12% of $1,000) that they otherwise would have owed.  It’s important to understand that tax deductions lower your taxable income,  not  taxes owed. Have you heard anyone say, “It’s okay if I spend that money because I can write it off on my taxes”? Some people treat tax deductions as if they are getting their money back. A more accurate way to look at a tax-deductible expense is that the government provides a percentage subsidy of that expense equaling your marginal tax rate.  So in the case of this example couple, the government subsidized 12% of that $1,000 expense and the couple’s taxes were lowered by $120 (12% of $1,000). Not bad, but not the same as a 100% subsidy.    Tax deductions vs. tax credits  Unlike tax deductions, tax credits decrease taxes owed dollar-for-dollar. For instance, if that same married couple above had a child, they could claim the  child tax credit  ($2,000 per child). Let’s say they had a combined taxable income of $60,000 and would ordinarily owe $7,000 in federal income taxes. The child tax credit would lower their tax owed to $5,000.  So which is better, tax deductions or tax credits? It depends on your tax bracket. Taxpayers in lower brackets often benefit more from tax credits, while taxpayers in higher brackets tend to benefit more from tax deductions. For instance, our example couple would need $16,667 in tax deductions to save $2,000 in taxes (12% of $16,667 = $2,000). Let’s compare that to another couple earning $350,000, putting them in the 32% bracket. That couple would only need $6,250 in tax deductions to save $2,000 in taxes (32% of $6,250 = $2,000).   Standard deduction, itemized deductions, and above-the-line deductions  Since the new tax bill passed, it’s even more important to pay attention to whether you itemize deductions or take the  standard deduction . The IRS grants every taxpayer a no-questions-asked standard deduction amount. You can either claim the standard deduction or itemize your deductions and claim that amount. You cannot do both. After adding up your deductible expenses for the year, if that total is larger than the standard deduction, it makes sense to itemize. If your total itemized deductions are lower than the standard deduction, then you should take the standard deduction.  The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) doubled the standard deduction. It is now  $12,400 for single taxpayers and $24,800 for married couples . After this change, a lot of taxpayers who usually itemized have found that it’s no longer in their interests. An estimated  13.7% of taxpayers  will itemize in 2019 compared to 31.1% if pre-TCJA law were still in effect. This means you may no longer be getting tax benefits from some of your expenses, which increases the real cost of those expenses to you.  Lastly,  above-the-line deductions  can be used whether you itemize or not, so they are very valuable.  Using this knowledge throughout the year  When you understand how tax deductions work, you can think about them not just at tax time, but also proactively. You can think about how the decisions you make today will impact your future tax bill.  For instance, in 2025, the standard deduction amounts are set to return to where they were before (essentially cut in half). Today’s larger standard deduction has caused some of you to start claiming that when you previously itemized. In that case, it could make sense to delay 2024 deductible expenses ( medical bills or charitable donations) into 2025. You will likely claim the larger TCJA standard deduction in 2024 either way, so those expenses provide no tax benefits. Spending that money in 2025 would provide additional deductions, because you would likely be back to itemizing after the standard deduction goes back down.  "} 
{"prompt":"How can you balance saving with the asset limits on federal and state benefits?","completion":"“How can you help people who are going to get bumped off their subsidized food and housing because they have assets? Then the federal and state agencies say ‘Hey, all is well now.” They may be making more, but not enough yet to sustain themselves, landing them right back in poverty. I’ve seen this happen to one woman who was told she had to work after a certain number of months. So, she did. Then she no longer qualified for the apartment she was in. She got a roomie for her new place. But that income in her house meant she no longer qualified for food stamps. She did what she was supposed to do and now her life is no better and, in fact, worse. So, if you have savings, it can hurt you. It’s not right, but that’s the way it is.”  Submitted by Jody L.  What you are describing is called “asset means testing.” You’ve touched on a hot topic for those of us in the business of helping people save money. Your story describes the situation that many people are facing if they receive public benefits and try to increase their income or save for emergencies.  What are Asset Limits?  Asset limits determine a person’s eligibility for public benefits programs. This is a very complex topic, so let’s start with this overview from  Prosperity Now , a nonprofit agency that focuses on the policy solutions that affect poverty:  “Many public benefit programs—such as cash welfare, food assistance and heating assistance—limit eligibility to those with few or no assets. If individuals or families have assets exceeding the state’s limit, they must “spend down” longer-term savings in order to receive what is often short-term public assistance. These asset limits, which were originally created to ensure that public resources did not go to “asset-rich” individuals, are a relic of entitlement policies that in some cases no longer exist. Cash welfare programs, for example, now focus on quickly moving individuals and families to self-sufficiency, rather than allowing them to receive benefits indefinitely. Personal savings and assets are precisely the kinds of resources that allow people to move off public benefit programs. Yet, asset limits can discourage anyone considering or receiving public benefits from saving for the future.”  We certainly don’t want people to take advantage of programs that are intended for those experiencing poverty. But as you noticed, this often becomes a “catch-22” if you are trying to work your way out of poverty.  How to Save While Receiving Benefits  So, what can you do to better your financial life if you are on public benefits?   Find a local nonprofit agency that understands asset limits and helps people manage the paradox of building financial security while on public benefits.  Know the asset limits in your state and for the benefits you are receiving. This doesn’t mean you can’t save. You just want to make sure that you don’t do harm to your overall financial situation.  There are a growing number of accounts that are not included in asset means testing. But be sure to check each type of account and the relevant benefits. See this  overview of SNAP  for an example.  Be mindful of any financial choices that impact your benefits. This is not to say that you should not take a job that moves you towards your goal. However, if a job doesn’t provide benefits (especially medical) and doesn’t pay well enough for you to manage without benefits, this may be an indicator that you should keep looking until you find employment that meets your needs.   The good news is that there are many organizations and people in the trenches fighting too. In some states, the efforts to repeal the means test is working. Prosperity Now has a  Scorecard  that tracks how states are doing regarding public benefits and asset limits. Check out your state and ways you can get involved if this issue is a hot topic for you too! "} 
{"prompt":"How Can I Get Started with Low-Risk Investments?","completion":" How do I begin with low risk investments? For example CD’s, money market accounts, etc.  Submitted by Deirel M.  First of all, way to go!  Investing  is all about preparing for your future and the fact that you’re clear that you want low risk is an appropriate first step.  Are You Ready to Start Investing?  How you begin depends on where you are in your investing journey. How much have you set aside to invest? Have you established an emergency fund to make sure you don’t need the money before a CD matures?  Let’s talk about certificates of deposit and money market accounts first.   What is a Certificate of Deposit?  Most certificates of deposit (CDs) require a minimum deposit to open. With a CD, you can’t add to the balance and you can’t change the term. Your rate of return is set for that period regardless of how the market fluctuates. If you withdraw the funds before it reaches maturity, you often pay fees and penalties. CDs have a wide variety of term (30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or even years) and, generally, the longer the term of CD, the better the interest rate.  What is a Money Market Account?  Money market accounts  (MMA) require a larger deposit to open compared a regular savings account and usually have limits on the number of withdrawals you can make in a month. Unlike a regular checking account, a MMA is an interest-earning account.  How to Get Started  So, now you know about the tools. What now?  If you’re starting out with no savings at all, one of the first things you can do is have a set dollar amount or percentage of your paycheck direct deposited to a savings account. If you can have it at a bank not connected to your checking account, that’s a bonus. Out of sight, out of mind. That can keep you from being tempted to make withdrawals (this is future money, right?). Once you have your desired amount, you can check with where the best rates for CD’s and money market accounts with  Bankrate  or check with your bank for their latest promotion.  If you aren’t quite ready to plunk down a large sum that you don’t touch, you can also explore other low-risk investments like savings bonds and high-yield savings accounts. With these, you can start with as little as $50-$100.  Check out more tips on investing:  Investing 101: Stocks, Bonds, and More When Should I Start Investing? "} 
{"prompt":"Thinking about Investing? Investment-Savvy Checklist","completion":"A lot of members tell us they’re interested in investing. Maybe you’re starting to save regularly, and you’re wondering how your money can work for you instead of  sitting passively in a bank account .  What Are Your Goals?  Before jumping into investment strategies, start with this basic question: what is the point of investing to you?  If your answer is something like, “I want to make oodles of money,” I suggest getting more specific and more realistic. If you expect to make a lot of money from an investment, this may cause you to take unnecessary (or unwise) risks to chase huge returns.  Instead, use your short, intermediate, and long-term targets and financial goals to inform your investment decisions.  How Much Can You Safely Invest?  Before thinking about your future self, make sure you’re taking care of your immediate needs. Your emergency fund and debt management should still be priorities. Make sure you have a sustainable plan for your daily money management. Investing has risk involved, so don’t count on that money being available in an emergency.  Beyond making sure you have enough saved for emergencies, think about how much you feel comfortable investing.  Assess your risk tolerance  – whether you’re comfortable with high-risk (potentially high-reward or high-loss) investments.  How Much Effort Do You Want to Put Into Investing?  There are so many options out there. Ask yourself how hard you want to work at maintaining your investment portfolio. Do you want to do lots of research and actively manage all your money, or do you want to let a service or professional manage your investments for you?  If you’re interested in a DIY approach,  do your research first . One option is to start small, perhaps with an app that allows you to manage relatively small investments (for example,  Acorns  or  Robinhood ).  If you’d prefer to leave your money to an expert, I caution you to  know your expert .  Start, Monitor, and Adjust  As with all your financial decisions, check in regularly to see if you’re happy with the results. If you’re not, review what you have done, take a good look at the outcome, and make adjustments if necessary.  One way to know if your investment plan is working for you is to do what we call “the pillow test.” It’s pretty easy. If your investments are causing you to lose sleep, you need a better plan – and don’t be afraid to get help. Your investment plan should be working  for  you, not causing you stress.

{"prompt":"How Do You Improve Your Credit Score?","completion":"    Sign up for SaverLife  to earn points and chances to win cash prizes when you read articles like this!  There are many things you can do to level up your finances. One area you can focus on that will help across the board is to improve your credit score. Having a good credit score saves you money and gives you more options. It can help you get better loan interest rates and pay less for insurance. It can also give you more housing options, the ability to rent without a cosigner, and you can sometimes even get security deposits for things like utilities waived. But where do you start?  Here are six things to work on if you want to improve your credit score.  1. Pay Your Bills on Time  Paying your bills on time is a huge way to improve your credit score. Keeping up with your monthly payments shows lenders that you are a good risk. It also demonstrates that you manage your money well and don’t overextend yourself. In the FICO Credit Scoring system, payment history accounts for 35% of your overall credit score. So, paying your bills on time can have a big impact as you work to improve your credit score.  2. Have a Credit Card  Credit is one of those things that you can’t build unless you have it. The easiest way to  establish credit  is to get a credit card and use it responsibly. Fifteen percent of your FICO credit score comes from your overall length of credit history. Getting a credit card and making on-time payments can improve your credit score.  3. Keep Your Account Usage Low  Another thing you can do to improve your credit is keep your credit utilization low. When lenders and credit card companies look at your credit utilization ratio, they look at how much of your available credit you are using. To do this, they compare your total outstanding balances across all your cards to your total available credit. Ideally, you want to keep this ratio below 30%.    That means if you have one credit card with a limit of $1,000, you don’t want to carry an outstanding balance of more than $300. The best way to keep this ratio low is to pick a few expenses you’ve budgeted for each month, charge them to your credit card, and then pay the balance in full each month. This allows you to keep your credit usage low.  4. Don’t Default on Loans  Just as paying your bills on time helps your credit score, so does paying your loans and not defaulting on them. Defaulting on a loan can stay on your credit report for 7-10 years. Sometimes a default occurs after the first missed payment. It can also occur after several missed payments, depending on the terms of the loan. These missed payments will negatively impact your credit score. So, keeping up with your loan payments will help you improve your credit score.  5. Have a Good Credit Mix  When building and improving your credit score, it’s important to maintain a good mixture of credit. This means that you want to have both installment credit (loans) and revolving credit (credit cards or charge accounts). Your credit mix accounts for 10% of your FICO score. It indicates to potential lenders how well you manage your money and whether or not you can meet your monthly financial obligations. While it is good to have a mix of credit, be sure to only borrow or charge what you can afford to pay back.  6. Open New Credit Sparingly  Another thing that can help improve your credit score is only opening new credit when you need it. This can help you avoid opening several new accounts all at once. Opening too many new accounts in a short period of time can lower your credit score and can also make you look like a risky borrower. Open new credit only when you need it and be sure to factor repayments into your budget.  Final Thoughts  Improving your credit score takes time, persistence, and patience. But it is possible! Be sure you understand what determines your credit score, know how your actions affect it, and recognize what you can do to change it. If you use your credit mindfully, pay your bills on time, and don’t spend more than you can afford to pay off, over time you will see your credit score improve. This will give you more opportunities and access to better interest rates as you move forward.

{"prompt":"6 Steps to Create the Perfect Budget","completion":" The key to creating a budget is finding what works to help you manage your money. Many budgeting tools exist, but you need to find what works for you. Managing your money is about choices – choosing how to earn, spend, save, and keep track of your money. A personalized, realistic budget can help you set priorities, direct spending, and manage your cash flow. While budgeting tools and practices vary from person to person, there are generally six steps that most people take to create a budget. Keep in mind, it is really more of an art than a science.  Step 1: Explore your goals and values  What’s important to you? What is your top financial or life goal? If you need some help, identifying your goals, use  this worksheet . Your goals will help you create a budget that affords your current obligations, activities you enjoy, and future plans.  Step 2: Gather and track your financial information  You need to understand what is happening now with your money, including income, expenses, and savings. What is coming in? What’s going out? What’s stored away? Most people know their regular earnings and expenses, but may not have a clear picture of irregular or day-to-day expenditures. To get a better sense of your cash flow, carefully track your income and expenses for at least 30 days.  Determining your income – the money you and your family receive on a regular basis from work, investments, public benefits, or business sales – might be relatively easy. For budgeting purposes, use your net (or take-home) monthly income after taxes and other payroll deductions have been taken out. Collect information related to income, such as paystubs, that show how much you bring in and how often from all sources. Calculate your total. If you prefer,  use a worksheet  to make sure you’re capturing everything.  Gathering expenses – anything you spend your money on – can be more involved. You have some expenses that are fixed and regular, such as rent, and others that change day-to-day, such as groceries or entertainment. To closely track all expenses for at least 30 days, you can gather monthly bills, collect receipts, use a notebook,  use a worksheet , use an online budgeting tool, and/or review your bank and credit card statements. Choose the method that works best for you. For irregular, expected expenses, such as car maintenance, an insurance premium, or car registration, gather past information or make estimates. After 30 days, gather all of your expense records (bills, receipts, bank statements, notebooks), categorize (housing expenses, food expenses), and then add up your total monthly expenses.  Also, note how much you already have set aside by checking your savings balance.  Step 3: Assess your current financial situation  What’s your bottom line? After you have all of your financial information in order, subtract your expenses from your monthly income to see what is left over (also known as your bottom line) to spend or save. If it’s helpful,  use a worksheet . In some cases, your bottom line might be negative, meaning that you are spending more than your current income. Consider what immediate changes you can make to bring in more, spend less, or do both.  If you have some money left over each month, consider whether it’s enough to cover essentials, money set aside for emergencies, your financial goals, and expenses that are important for you, such as fitness or entertainment. If not (and that is usually the case), you’ll have to make some changes to current spending, saving, and earning habits. Nearly always, reaching financial goals requires us to change our financial habits. How much exactly do you need to set aside each month to be on track with your current situation and future plans?  Step 4: Make changes to how you manage your money  From your assessment, you have a dollar amount in mind of how much you need to adjust your current financial habits. To change your bottom line, there are only three changes you can make: increase your income, spend less, or do both. Bringing in more income could include turning a hobby into a business or second job, maximizing your tax benefits, accessing public benefits, or selling items you do not use.  For reducing expenses, move from general to specific changes. First, note your essentials and priorities. You can use a  tool to prioritize . Then, think about your least important expenses. What costs too much? What could you change? Spend some time looking at the big picture. Brainstorm, and get creative. After that, go through specific spending categories, such as transportation or insurance, and consider changes. Could you carpool or take public transportation more often to save on gas? Could you shop around for a lower cost insurance plan? Keep drilling down until your expenses are where you need them to be. Then integrate the changes into your budget.  Step 5: Create your budget  By now, you’ve done all of the hard work. You have gathered your income and expenses, and you have made changes to habits. It’s time to commit to your new plan by putting it in writing. To make your written budget, you can use  a worksheet , an app, a spreadsheet, or a notebook.  It is important that you find a tool that works for you to map out your new plan for saving and spending.  Step 6: Follow, track, and adjust as needed  Follow your plan as best you can and continue to track what you actually spend using a record-keeping system that works for you. At least every month, reconcile your planned budget versus your actual expenses. Your findings may help guide you to adjust your budget or your spending habits. Remember, a budget is your plan to manage your money in ways that work for you! "} 
{"prompt":"5 Steps to Get on Track if You’re Living Paycheck to Paycheck","completion":" Do you find yourself falling behind and not able to live within your means? If you’re not sure if you’re living beyond your means, check out my recent article where I help you  figure out if you need to make some changes .  Here are some solutions to help you live within your means and improve your financial situation:  1. Track Your Spending  It’s easy to lose track of what you spend, especially when you use credit cards, debit cards, and automatic bill pay. While those methods are convenient, they hinder our ability to determine how much we are actually spending. Ideally, you should track your spending for 30 days. Track every penny so that you can get an accurate accounting of where your money is going. Tracking how you spend your money over a 30-day period is useful for creating an accurate spending plan.  2. Create a Spending Plan  A spending plan is a great way to evaluate your income and expenses. To create an effective spending plan, you must be honest about your spending habits. Look for ways to reduce expenses and/or increase income.  Read more about creating the perfect budget for you.  3. Set Up Your Emergency Fund Before Paying Your Debt  You need to be prepared for emergencies. If you are using all of your extra income to pay down debt and an emergency occurs, you will end up taking on more debt, the exact opposite of what you want. I recommend saving between 5% – 10% of your net (take home) pay before you put extra money towards debt.  4. Pay Off Credit and Loans Using the Snowball Method  This snowball method is relatively simple and psychologically satisfying.  You pay off the smaller debt first and make your way up to the larger debts. This method may not be the most cost-effective, but it helps motivate you towards debt freedom as you feel accomplished every time you eliminate debt.   Note that you should typically pay off high-interest debt first. Credit cards are usually a great place to start due to their high-interest rates. If you’re highly motivated, I recommend starting with high-interest debt and working your way down. This is called the  avalanche method .   5. Use Cash  Using cash is a great way to stick to your budget. Why? You can only spend as much as you have. Swiping a credit card is easy, but limiting yourself to a specific amount of cash is an effective way to get your spending habits in line with your spending goals.  With hard work and commitment, you can  live debt-free ! "} 
{"prompt":"How to Get the Best Rate on a Loan","completion":"If you need money for the short or long term, it’s important to remember that not all loans are created equal – and the price you pay for that money (in fees and interest) may vary dramatically.  What do you need?  Before shopping around for loans, you should know how much money you’re looking to borrow! You’ll want to make sure you’re only borrowing what you need. If you’re clear on how much you actually need, you won’t feel as tempted to accept an offer that is beyond your needs.  I learned this the hard way. When I was in college, I was approved for a loan that was much larger than I needed to pay my expenses. The idea of all that extra money was so enticing that I didn’t think about the long-term impacts of taking more money than I needed. But those loans haunted me during repayment. Ultimately, I had to remember the “no shame zone” and forgive myself.  Before  you apply for a loan, consider how much time you’ll need to repay the loan as well as well as what your repayment plan will be.  What’s your credit score?  When you apply for a loan, the lender will run a credit check. But if you know your score ahead of time, you’ll know what to expect going in to the conversation. If you know that your credit score is low, consider improving your credit before applying so that you can get a lower interest rate. This might be tough if you need the money soon, but talk to a  reputable credit counselor  to learn about your options.  If your credit score isn’t as high as you’d like it to be, you could ask someone to cosign the loan with you to get a better rate. Check that the person cosigning your loan has a better credit score than yours, and make sure you don’t make any late payments, because that will harm your cosigner.  What are your options?  I recommend getting multiple loan offers so that you can compare the terms and make sure you’re getting the best deal. But beware! Shopping around for a loan can impact your credit. The good news is that  FICO Scores  understand that people may request loans from multiple companies even if they’re only looking for one. FICO will ignore mortgage, auto, and student loan inquiries made in the 30 days prior to scoring.  Once you have multiple options,  evaluate them  based on the terms, interest rates, payments, and the  total  interest that you’ll pay over the course of the loan. Many lenders will try to get you to focus on the payment. That is certainly a factor you should consider, but it’s not the most important factor.  Where are your limits?  Be honest with yourself. If you don’t have a budget already, work out how you will handle the payments and make sure you know how you’ll fit this new debt into your financial plan. "} 
{"prompt":"What is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)?","completion":" Hi, I’m Dirk. I’m a tax expert with Intuit’s TurboTax and I’m here today to talk to you about the Earned Income Tax Credit.  What is the Earned Income Tax Credit?  It’s a tax credit available for those who are low- and moderate-income families and the benefit varies depending on whether you have children or not.  If you’re eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit, you may receive up to $6,431 in the year 2018. The Earned Income Tax Credit increases, plateaus, and then begins to phase out as you earn more income. If you earn enough income, you won’t be eligible for it at all.  Also, some states have an Earned Income Tax Credit program that would be in addition to the federal Earned Income Tax Credit. So be sure to check if your state has this available.  While millions of households already claim this credit, the IRS says that many who are eligible do not claim this credit. To learn more, go to  irs.gov . "} 
{"prompt":"Should I Open a Savings Account for My Kids?","completion":" Before opening a savings account, think about why you and your child are saving money. Here are some common reasons  Pay for  future education expenses Help your child manage the money they make from their job  Give your child a lump sum of money when they graduate from high school  Your reason for saving the money will help you decide where to save the money. There are three main options that may be a good fit for you  529 College Savings Account  If you’re saving money for educational expenses, consider an education savings account, like a 529 plan. A 529 is a savings account specifically for educational expenses. You can invest the money you put into a 529 plan. If you use the money for a  qualified educational  cost, then all of the money is typically tax-free. Depending on the state you live in, the amount you put into the 529 plan may be state tax-deductible. You also maintain control over the account.  Benefits of a 529 Account  The money gets special tax treatment by the IRS 529 plans owned by custodial parents generally don’t heavily impact your child’s financial aid eligibility  Downsides of a 529 Account  You are limited to using the funds for education-related expenses You are limited in what you can invest inside a 529 plan  If you want the flexibility to use the money for anything, then a savings account may be a better fit.  Joint Bank Account with Your Child  These accounts typically require you to open the account with your kids. Both you and your child will own the account. This option gives you the ability to manage the account until your child is mature enough to handle the account alone. Your child can use the funds in the account generally at any time for any reason. A joint account may be an option for a parent with a working child who wants to both save and spend the money in the account.   Benefits of a Joint Bank Account  Joint ownership so you can manage the account The child has access to the account   Downsides of a Joint Bank Account  You’re responsible for what your child does in the account Possible financial aid eligibility impact  UTMA/UGMA Custodial Accounts  The Uniform Transfers To Minors Act (UTMA) allows you to put more assets into the account, like real estate. The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) limits what you can put into the account to mostly cash and investments like stocks and bonds. The account is managed by an adult on behalf of a minor. The minor doesn’t have access to the account until they are an adult. UTMA/UGMA may be a consideration if you want to save (or invest) money to give to your child once they are an adult.  Benefits of a UTMA/UGMA Custodial Account  Lots of investment options Can use the money for any purpose  Downsides of a UTMA/UGMA Custodial Account  At a certain age (can vary by state), the money belongs to the child Possible financial aid impact   To recap, before opening an account to save money for your child, decide the purpose of the savings. The purpose of the savings will help you decide what option is best for you and your child.  "} 
{"prompt":"What’s the difference between withdrawing from a 401k and taking out a 401k loan?","completion":" When life happens and there’s a big bill attached, we often scramble to figure out how to pay it. Ideally, an unexpected expense should be covered by your emergency savings account. If you don’t have enough  savings, consider asking for a payment plan or delaying the bill until you get a tax return or bonus.  If those options don’t work, as a last resort, you may be able to use your 401k plan. It’s considered a last resort because the purpose of a 401k  is to save money you may need when you’re older and possibly unable to work. There are two options to taking money out of a 401k while you are working: a hardship withdrawal or a 401k plan loan.  401k Hardship Withdrawals  You take money out of your 401k plan for a specific  IRS-approved hardship  (prevention of eviction, education expenses, etc.) and you’re not returning the funds. Here are a few details you should be aware of:  With few exceptions, the amount you withdraw is taxed. You may also owe a 10% penalty if you remove the money before you are 59 ½ years of age. The amount withdrawn is restricted to what you need to cover the hardship. You will need documentation to prove your hardship and hardship amount. Many employers will not allow you to contribute to a 401k plan for about six months after your withdrawal. If you choose a 401k hardship withdrawal, you can have additional taxes taken out of the amount received. However, many find they still owe taxes or get a much smaller (or no) refund. Talk to a tax professional to make sure you withhold the correct amount of taxes. If you take out a 401k plan loan, your take-home pay will be less because the loan payments come directly out of your paycheck. Adjust your spending to account for the lower paycheck.   401k Loans  You borrow against your 401k plan and paying an interest rate given to you by your employer. The payments typically last 1-5 years. If you are using the money to buy a home, you may be able to take longer to pay. You pay yourself back through monthly payroll deductions.    Because it’s a loan, you typically do not owe taxes, as long as you are making the payments. Some companies may restrict how much you can take out and how often you can request a 401k loan. Contact your 401k plan for more information. If you leave your job, your company may require you to pay the remaining loan balance back in full within a specific time frame. If you do not pay the money back or roll it over within a particular time frame, the remaining loan amount is typically taxable. You may also have to pay a 10% penalty on the remaining balance if you are under 59 ½.  To avoid having to use your 401k plan for emergencies, open a savings account and start with an amount you can easily save (ideally through payroll deductions). If you get a 401k plan loan, once the loan payments end, consider having the former loan amount automatically deducted from your payroll into a savings account. These steps will go a long way into turning an unexpected expense from a crisis to a minor inconvenience. "} 
{"prompt":"What do I need to apply for Marketplace insurance?","completion":" You need some basic information to start the Open Enrollment process.  First, you need to provide information about your household, including household size (including anyone you claim on your tax return). For each of these people, you need some basic information like birth dates, home addresses, and social security numbers.

{"prompt":"What Is APR?","completion":"Your  Annual Percentage Rate (APR)  is the interest you will pay over the course of a year. This doesn’t tell you how much you will actually pay if your interest is compounded in shorter increments. Our loans are usually compounded monthly, or for most credit cards, daily! YIKES!  If you really want to know how much you’re paying on your credit balances each day, divide your APR by 365 to come up with the daily interest charge. "} 
{"prompt":"What are the biggest money sinks that people can cut out of their lives to save more?","completion":" Many people don’t even realize that they have a money sink, much less what their money sinks are. We are so heavily marketed to and conditioned to spend in America. Using a debit or credit card feels so removed from real money that it doesn’t even feel like spending. It’s easy to spend without paying attention.  If you want to find the leak in your budget, take these steps. You might be surprised at what you find.   Step 1: Take an Inventory of Your Spending  Go to your checking account and pull up 30 days’ worth of spending.  It doesn’t matter what 30 days, just as long as they are consecutive. Every time money came out of your account during that time frame, categorize it by writing it down in a category. Some common categories are food, entertainment, gas, and rent or house payment. Feel free to make any category that fits your spending habits.   Next, add up all the categories. Is there one that made you say “WOW! I had no idea I spend that much on (fill in the blank)!” That is the money sink or leak in your wallet.  Step 2: Reflect on Your Goals  Ask yourself, “Does this spending move me towards my financial goals?” If not, you have just discovered the money sink that you should cut out or reduce in order to save more. Now is the time to decide to do something about it. Sometimes, it’s easier than you think. If you stop every morning for coffee, you could be spending over $1,000 a year just for that one item. By simply preparing a cup of coffee at home, putting it in a travel mug, and taking it with you, you have stopped that leak. Now you have money to put towards your emergency fund or financial goals. You also still have the caffeine you need to get your day started.  Step 3: Remember to Enjoy Life  It’s important to note that if it’s something you really want, it’s okay to have it! Make sure you are purchasing it in a manner that is reasonable and doesn’t damage your long-term goals.  "} 
{"prompt":"How to Pay Bills Without a Bank Account","completion":" According to a  report  by the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) in 2019, 5.4% of households in American were unbanked or had no bank accounts. There are several reasons that someone may not have a bank account. Past financial mistakes like too many overdraft fees or bounced checks can make it hard to open a new account. Some people don’t trust banks or have the funds to meet the minimum balance requirements to open a new account. Others just want to avoid bank fees. If you don’t have a bank account, it can be helpful to know your options for cashing checks, getting paid, and paying bills.    How to Cash a Check Without a Bank Account  If you don’t have a bank account, you will probably still need to cash checks. Whether it is your paycheck, your tax refund, or any other source of income, knowing how to cash a check will help you get your money.  The best place to try to cash a check without a bank account is the bank that issued it. If you get your paycheck, for example, cashing it at the same bank where your employer banks is a good option. This is because the bank can verify that the account the check was written from has the funds in it to cover it. This advice goes for personal checks, too. If you can, try to cash them at the same bank they are written from. It is important to note that you will need proof of ID to cash your checks. There may also be a small fee for cashing them since you don’t have an account at the bank.  Another option for cashing your paycheck, tax refund, or other income is to cash it at a big box store like Walmart and Kroger. Similar to banks, in order to cash a check at a store, you will need a valid ID. The stores may also charge a small check-cashing fee. Often these stores won’t cash personal checks because they cannot verify if the funds to cover the check are in the check writer’s account.  Using a Prepaid Debit Card  While cashing your checks and having access to the funds is important, if you want to also be able to pay bills online, using a prepaid debit card may be a better solution. Prepaid debit cards work like debit cards, but you don’t need a bank account to get one. Some prepaid debit cards allow you to have money directly deposited into them. This means that you can have your paycheck, tax refund, or other income sources deposited directly to the card. You can also find prepaid debit cards that will let you deposit checks remotely using the camera on your smartphone.  Paying bills may be easier with a prepaid debit card than cash. You can use your prepaid debit card to make purchases online and pay bills. Some even offer bill pay services. It is important to look at the fees associated with the card you choose. Some charge reloading fees to add funds to the card. Others charge you to get cash from an ATM or pay bills through their bill pay service.  Final Thoughts  Not having a bank account can make it more difficult to cash checks and pay bills. If you want to cash a check and have the cash for spending, cashing the check at the bank that issued it or a big box store may be the best route. If you want to pay bills online, a prepaid debit card may be the answer.  No matter what route you choose, be sure that you understand the fees and requirements. You want to find the option that gives you access to the features you need for the lowest fees. This will help you meet your personal finance needs while keeping the money that you are making! "} 
{"prompt":"Do I Need to Adjust My Spending? 5 Signs You’re Living Beyond Your Means","completion":" In a time of “buy now pay later,” it’s easy to fall into spending habits that lead to debt. We don’t even need to leave our homes to make large purchases, making reckless purchasing even easier.   Here are five warning signs that you may be living beyond your means:  1. You Aren’t Saving At Least 10% of Your After-Tax Income  We are all advised to save at least 10-15% of our income. If you can’t save 10%, then you may be living beyond your means. Savings instruments include 401(k) contributions, emergency fund contributions, investments, and deposits into your bank account.   2. You Have No Emergency Fund  Part of the reason you need to save at least 10% is to have cash set aside for the inevitable emergency. Putting emergencies on your credit card or taking out a loan will continue the cycle of living beyond your means. I recommend that you have 3-6 months’ worth of your monthly expenses set aside.  3. You’re Living Paycheck to Paycheck  If you find yourself with more month than money, you are living beyond your means. Many people believe they do not have the required salary to set aside savings or cannot afford to reduce their current lifestyle.   4. You Use Credit Cards or Take Out Loans to Pay Bills  Believe it or not, many people borrow money to pay their bills. This is a clear sign that you cannot afford your current lifestyle. If you find yourself not being able to afford food, toiletries, and clothes, it’s time to see if you can make changes.   5. You’re Afraid Your Friends Will Judge You  Social media can wreak havoc on your wallet. Do you ever find yourself buying items to please others? Do you buy items just to post a picture on social media? Evaluate what you really need and stop trying to impress others.   If you think you may be living beyond your means, congratulations! That’s the first step to making a change. Next, I’m going to walk you through the  tips I use with my clients  to help them make and execute a plan to live within their means. "} 
{"prompt":"What Is a Credit Score?","completion":"Your credit score is a number that is calculated by a company and sold to creditors to let them know how you have managed credit in the past. This is how your credit risk is determined (how likely you are to pay your debts on time).  FICO  (Fair Issac Corporation) is the most commonly used score by lenders. It can be worth it to pay for your score if you know you will be borrowing money in 6 months to a year. Otherwise, reviewing your credit reports for accuracy and paying any credit accounts on time is the fastest way to build your credit profile.  Photo  by  CafeCredit "} 
{"prompt":"I’m Married and Filed Jointly, Then the IRS Kept My Refund. What Happened?","completion":" Sometimes you don’t realize it is going to happen. You are expecting your tax refund and it never arrives. You may ask your tax professional or call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040.   Here’s what may have happened: they kept the refund because your spouse owes money. This is often back taxes, both federal and state. But it can also be student loan debt, child support, or other government debt.   What Can I Do?  In some cases, you can set up a payment plan so that you can receive future tax refunds. In some cases, couples decide to file Married Filing Separate for future tax filings. But if you pay to file your taxes, this can increase costs to file. More importantly, this can cause you to lose out on credits or deductions that aren’t allowed when filing Married Filing Separate.  Also, this solution doesn’t help you  now .   What is the Injured Spouse Allocation?  Fortunately, there is another path. And you can do this with your tax return or afterwards if you don’t realize the issue until after the return is filed. The IRS has a tax form for this situation. It is  Form 8379 Injured Spouse Allocation . You can file this form with your tax return, with an amendment, or separately after your tax return is filed. “Injured spouse” in this case doesn’t mean physical or mental injuries. It means that one person’s debt is affecting the “injured” spouse’s share of the tax refund. Form 8379 is used to allocate a portion of the refund to the spouse. It is possible that the IRS will determine a different number than you or your tax professional determines by using the form.   Downsides of Injured Spouse Allocation  The disadvantage of the injured spouse form is that it adds to the processing time. When filed with your joint tax return it can mean it will take 11 to 14 weeks to process your tax return. A Form 8379 filed after a joint tax return is processed can take about 8 weeks to process. Realize that it also slows down the pay-off of the debt. Form 8379 has to be filed each year when filing a joint return if one spouse has debt that is subject to collections from the refund.   Is Injured Spouse Allocation Right for You?  The Injured Spouse option can be very helpful because it often allows you to make sure a large portion of the refund is still received. And preserving some of the refund for you to use can make the longer processing time worth it.  One final point: if you have debt that your refund may be directed towards involuntarily, you may want to let your spouse know before it happens. I’ve found that this is one surprise that spouses don’t like! "} 
{"prompt":"Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA): A Free Way to Get Help With Your Taxes","completion":" Doing taxes can be frustrating. When every dollar counts, many of us don’t want to spend money to meet our obligations as a taxpayer. Many of us don’t want to be working in software, hoping that the right questions are asked and that you provide the right answers. This is where VITA may provide a good option for you.  Who Is Eligible for Tax Help from VITA or TCE?  The IRS’s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program has been around for over 50 years. Typically, it offers free tax help and tax filing assistance to:  People who generally make about $57,000 a year or less Persons with disabilities Military service members and families Limited English-speaking taxpayers  Also, the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) program specializes in assisting those who are 60 years of age or older.  The sites for these programs are staffed with IRS-certified volunteers and are often part of non-profit organization. All the volunteers who prepare tax returns must have training that meets or exceeds IRS standards. Some sites have restrictions on whom they will assist and on what level of complexity they will handle. And others may help people with higher income than indicated above. It is a good idea to make sure ahead of time that they can assist you for your particular tax situation.  I have seen non-profits that are focused on one segment of our society offer VITA services to people in other segments. If an organization may be more convenient for you and you aren’t sure they will help you, ask them.   How to Find a VITA Site  You could use favorite search engine to find a VITA site or call around to non-profits to track one down. But I prefer to use the IRS website – after all, they are paid by our tax dollars! The IRS has a  VITA/TCE Locator Tool . In addition to the location, you can find what days of the year they operate (some are open outside of “tax season”), hours of operation, whether services can be provided using languages other than English, contact information, and whether an appointment is required.   Note that some VITA sites assist you in doing the tax returns. Others do the returns for you much like when a tax professional does your tax return. If you prefer one approach versus the other, make sure you ask before you go.  VITA is a good option if you want in-person assistance, if you meet the requirements of the VITA site for assistance, and your tax return isn’t too complicated. Tax prep fees can easily cost several hundred dollars. If VITA fits your situation, you can keep those dollars. My guess is you can find some good uses for that money.  You can also explore  other options for filing your taxes for free . "} 
{"prompt":"What is a good interest rate?","completion":" You may have heard that there are only two kinds of people: those who pay interest and those who earn it. In reality, we all likely end up occupying both sides of that equation.  The first thing to know about borrowing money and paying interest is that how much you pay depends on your credit score. Your credit score is kind of like your financial report card – it demonstrates to creditors your reliability as a borrower. The higher your score, the more desirable you are as a borrower, and the lower your interest rates will be.   What’s a good interest rate for home loans?  According to  NerdWallet , the average is 4.1% for 30-year  mortgages  and 3.6% for 15-year mortgages as of October 16th. If your  credit score  is Good (670-739), aim for 3.75% for a 30-year mortgage or 3% for a 15-year mortgage. If your credit score is Fair (580-669), aim for around 4.75% for a 30-year and 3.125% for a 15-year. Visit NerdWallet’s  comparison tool  for personalized estimates. Getting approved for a mortgage with a Poor credit score is very difficult. Work to increase your credit score or look into  FHA mortgages , which are more accessible because they are insured by the government.  What’s a good interest rate for a car loan?  According to  Bankrate , the average interest rate for a new car loan is just over 5% for borrowers with a Good credit score, 7.91% for borrowers with a Fair credit score, and 12.17% for borrowers with a Poor credit score. For used car loans, average rates are 6.38%, 10.91%, and 16.78% respectively. According to  NerdWallet , the best rate would be around 3% for those with Good or Excellent credit.   What’s a good credit card interest rate?  You may have noticed that credit cards charge much higher interest rates than car and home loans. That’s because car and home loans are secured debt – the car and home pose as collateral for the loans. If you decide not to make your payments, the bank repossesses the property and sells it to recoup as much of the loan as possible. Credit card debt, on the other hand, is unsecured debt. If you decide to stiff your credit card company, their only recourse is to sue you and hope to recover enough from you to make their efforts worthwhile. This makes it much more difficult for credit card companies to collect unpaid debts. Therefore, they demand a higher interest rate to compensate for the higher risk.   According to  NerdWallet , credit card interest rates range from 12.9% for individuals with Good or Excellent credit to 24.9% for those with Fair credit.  Credit Karma  estimates your credit score and lets you shop for loans and credit cards based on your credit profile.  What’s a good savings account interest rate?  Now let’s talk about the more fun side of the interest equation – earning interest. Savings accounts allow you to set aside money for later while maintaining access to it when you need it. Banks compensate you for providing capital to them by paying you interest. Online banks tend to pay the highest interest rates, because the lack of brick and mortar branches decreases their costs. According to  NerdWallet , the going rate for savings accounts at these banks is around 2%.   What’s a good CD interest rate?  Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are offered by banks and credit unions. These accounts pay you interest in exchange for your agreement to leave money in the account for a specific period of time. According to  NerdWallet , a good interest rate for a one-year CD is 2.25%, and a good rate for a 3-year CD is 2.35%. You can use their  comparison tool  to shop for offerings in your area. "} 
{"prompt":"6 Steps for When Your Credit Is Denied","completion":"First, let’s start with the facts.  There’s a widespread fallacy that a score determines whether or not you get credit. The truth is that lenders use a  variety  of factors to make credit decisions. These factors include your FICO scores, but also take into account your income, your employment history, and your credit history.  This means that someone could theoretically extend you credit even though your score is low or decline your credit request even though you have a high score! The decision will depend on the specific creditor’s underwriting policies.  So if your credit application has been denied (or if you didn’t get the rate or terms you want), here are some steps you should take:  1. Ask Questions  Ask the creditor or insurance company how they evaluated your application and whether they used a credit scoring system. If they use a scoring system, ask them what factors are used in their system, and how you can improve your application. By law, the creditor  must provide specific reasons that your application was rejected .  2. Check Your Credit Report  When your credit is denied, do you know that you can get a free credit report? You usually have 60 days to get this free report from the credit bureau that was used for the decision. Before you reapply or apply to other credits, check this credit report for accuracy.  3. Dispute any Inaccuracies  If you find inaccuracies in your credit report, it’s important to contest them so that they don’t affect your future credit applications. Check out this  sample letter  that you can use to dispute information on your credit report.  4. Write an Explanatory Letter  In addition to inaccurate or incomplete information on your credit report, you may also feel that there are extenuating circumstances that a creditor should know. In some cases, it may even be helpful to  add a short explanatory statement to your credit report .  5. Think about Why You’re Applying for this Credit  This is a great time to revisit your financial goals and plan. How does this credit fit into your short, intermediate, or long-term goals?  6. Take Measures to Improve Your Credit  Consider using a credit-building product, like secured cards or second chance accounts. And focus on the areas that have the greatest impact on your credit, such as a history of on-time payments.  I also want to caution you to avoid predatory lenders if you are denied credit. Be your own advocate and don’t accept credit that has unreasonable terms and conditions. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Start Couponing","completion":" Using coupons can be a great way to stretch your grocery budget. Whether you save $2.00 or $25.00, that is money that you can put towards your financial goals. It’s easy to get started, according to  The Krazy Coupon Lady .  What to Buy with Coupons  She suggests when you are starting out, focus your energy on the expensive items. These are things like laundry detergent, diapers and baby formula. Make sure you are only buying things you need. Don’t be tempted to put items in your cart just because you have a coupon. Buying items that you will never use, no matter how much you save, is still a waste of money.  Where to Find Coupons  You can find inserts of coupons in the Sunday paper. The Krazy Coupon Lady suggests going to the local recycling center for these, or buying discounted Sunday papers on Monday. If you absolutely have to buy a paper on Sunday, try the dollar store. Paying for coupons can negate your savings.  You can also find coupons online. KCL’s data base is a great place to start. There are also P&G coupons that you can bring. Using files or an accordion file is a great way to keep your coupons separated into categories so you can easily find the savings.  How to Use Your Coupons  To start saving, make a list of the items you need to buy. Then go through your coupons and find any that you can use for this list. Pay attention to requirements on the coupon. You may have to buy two, or there may be a certain size you have to buy in order to use the coupon. Also, check the expiration date. Make a note of this on your list so you don’t have to go through the coupons and waste time while shopping.  Once you go to the checkout, hand the cashier your stack of coupons and start placing your items on the checkout counter. When the clerk is done, they should scan your coupons and you get to watch your bill go lower and lower! It’s the best part.  Use Coupons to Grow Your Savings Account  When the clerk gives you your receipt, you should be able to see the “total savings” for that purchase. That is the amount of money you need to transfer to your savings account when you get home. You were going to spend it anyway, so you might as well move that money so that you can save it for something you really want.  It takes a little practice, and you have to get organized and find a system that works best for you, but it will be worth it once you start. "}

We’re spending time with family, celebrating the holidays, and planning for the coming year. This is exactly what scammers rely on to separate you from your hard-earned money.  What to do with a possible scam  The first step to staying ahead of scammers is to be very critical of all communications you receive that aren’t from a trusted sender. When you receive a text, email, or call about taxes:   Stop  – Scammers use people’s anxieties about taxes against them. They count on you taking action without looking too closely, so don’t immediately respond.  Scrutinize  – Look closely at the communication and scrutinize what you see. A good resource for this is  Taxpayer Advocate  from the IRS. You can also contact your state’s Taxpayer Advocate services –  find yours here .  Take Action  – If you believe you’ve been targeted for a scam, report it to your law enforcement’s non-emergency number or the  FTC .   Signs of an imposter scam  Be on the lookout for scams on the phone, online, through email or mail, as well as in person or at a business. Here are some red flags, from the  Consumer Finance Protection Bureau :   Sweepstakes  – Someone tells you you’ve won a sweepstakes that you didn’t enter  Asking for Payment  – Someone tells you to pay taxes or fees upfront  Urgency  – Someone pressures you to take action, such as making a payment or  giving personal information , immediately  Government Official  – A fake government official contacts you to confirm your winnings  Threats  – The IRS says they have seen  a surge of phone scams  where fake IRS agents threaten arrest, deportation, and license revocation.   Choose a trustworthy tax preparer  You’re trusting your tax preparer not only with a lot of personal information, but also to accurately represent you to the IRS. Most tax professionals are ethical and provide high-quality services, but  be on the lookout for scams and identity theft . Watch out for tax preparers who:   Promise very large tax refunds  Ask you to sign a blank return  Tell you how much of a refund you’ll get before looking at your records  Charge fees based on a percentage of the refund   Filing taxes can be stressful, so make sure your preparer is truly on your side and is not taking risks with your financial future.  Can you file for free?  Start by  determining whether you’re eligible for free tax preparation . If you are, this is most likely your best choice because the volunteers are trained to help you find all of the tax credits and exemptions that you are eligible to claim.  If you want to do your taxes on your own, see if you’re eligible for  Free File , which allows you to use brand-name software for free.  70% of tax payers  are eligible to use Free File.

Some quick links if you want to go straight to one of the options above:  IRS Free File website VITA information  and  VITA locator Free File Fillable Forms IRS2Go mobile app  to check your refund status, make a payment, and find free tax prep assistance  File Your Taxes Using Free File  Some of us have been frustrated in the past when we see an advertisement for free tax filing. But then we go to do our taxes, and it turns out that we still end up paying. Here’s the solution. The IRS has a program called IRS Free File. The IRS partners with many tax preparation companies that you may recognize to offer their software for free. It can help you find an option for totally free tax filing software. You’ll be able to know before you get too far in if it will truly be free for your situation.   There is an income limitation. For the 2021 Filing Season (2020 tax returns) your income must be less than $72,000 for 2020 to qualify. This limit is based on your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). For most people, AGI is close to or the same as their Gross Income. Also, the more complicated your return, the less likely you’ll be able to get it done and filed completely for free. The IRS has a list of  forms that the Free File partners offer for free . Partners only have to offer the most commonly used forms for free. One of the advantages of Free File is that once the 2021 Filing Season gets started, you can compare the different Free File partners offers through IRS.gov.  If you file state income taxes, check whether you will be able to file your state tax return for free through Free File. As we roll into the 2021 Filing Season, you’ll be able to  check out Free File partners . A disclaimer: while Free File makes it easier to find a truly free option, there can still be cases where something comes up after you’ve chosen a software option. You may need to file a form that isn’t supported by the free option offered by the Free File partner. Unfortunately, this is normal due to our complicated tax code. If you haven’t filed your return yet, you aren’t obligated to pay. You can go back and choose another option or look for a free in-person option.   Get Help Filing Your Taxes with Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA)  The IRS’s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs offer free basic tax return preparation. But there are qualifications. Generally, VITA is for people earning $57,000 or less, but some locations may go higher. There is also VITA support for people with disabilities and for taxpayers with limited English. Most VITA programs are for older folks, for minorities, and for military service members. If you find one that focuses on a group that you aren’t part of, they may still be able to help you. It doesn’t hurt to ask!  Much like the IRS Free File program, there are typically limitations on the type of forms a VITA location will do for taxpayers. And some locations offer guided tax return assistance, meaning you will be doing the tax return with their help. So, if you want them to do it for you, check ahead of time to see what they offer. You can find a location using your preferred internet search engine, but I prefer the  VITA locator tool . Check during tax season (usually January – April) if you can’t find a location close to you outside of tax season.   File Your Taxes the Old-School Way  You can go to IRS.gov, print out the forms, and read the instructions to do your tax returns by hand. The IRS prefers that taxpayers file tax returns electronically and many states encourage taxpayers to file their state taxes electronically. It will generally take you longer to prepare a tax return on paper. Plus, processing a paper tax return will almost always take longer.  Once the 2021 Filing Season is up and running in January, you can also get  fillable forms online  on the IRS website. Anyone can use these to file electronically. But with this electronic filing, you have to follow the publications and instructions on your own. It doesn’t include software to help with preparing tax returns.   So those are some free tax filing options. Maybe you can’t avoid taxes, but perhaps you can avoid  paying  to fulfill your tax obligation when your situation isn’t too complicated.  ***  SaverLife is a nonprofit that helps you save money with helpful tips, a supportive community, and prizes to reward you on your savings journey.

{"prompt":"Do I Qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness?","completion":" To participate in Public Service Loan Forgiveness, make sure that you meet all the requirements. You must have the right type of loans, the correct occupation, a full-time job, and the correct repayment plan. Plus, you need to make eligible payments for ten years. After ten years, if you meet all of these conditions, you are eligible to have the remaining balance on your student loans forgiven.  Let’s dive into each aspect of Public Service Loan Forgiveness qualifications.  Check if You Have Qualifying Loans  Only Direct Loans qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. You can check your loan type with your student loan servicer. If you do not have direct loans, you can consolidate your student loans into a direct consolidation loan to qualify.    Does Your Employment Qualify?  Any full-time job in a government organization at any level or with any non-profit organization that is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) will allow you to qualify for public service. Government positions include jobs at the federal, state, local, and tribal level. Time spent working full-time for the Peace Corps or Americorps as a volunteer can also count as qualified employment.  You must work a qualifying job for ten years. But you should note that you don’t have to work the same qualifying job for the entire time. Nor do you have to work your ten years consecutively. But you do need ten years of qualifying payments while working for a qualifying employer to complete the program.  Qualifying Repayment Plans and Payments  To qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, you have to be on the right repayment plan. All income-driven repayment plans currently offered by federal student loan servicers qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness.  Payments made under the standard repayment plan also qualify. But this plan allows for full repayment of your balance in ten years, so there would be nothing left to forgive. For your payments to count, make all of your payments no later than fifteen days after your due date and always pay the full amount indicated on your bill.  Submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness  Employment Certification Form  annually to be sure that your employer qualifies for the program. I recommend filling this form out every year even if your employer has not changed. This will help you be sure you are still meeting all the requirements of the program.  Note that there’s only one student loan servicer that is a part of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, FedLoan.  If you have a different servicer, when you fill out the Employment Certification Form, send it to FedLoan, and your student loan servicer will be changed to FedLoan.  ***  After completing your 120 payments, fill out and submit the  Public Service Loan Forgiveness Application for Forgiveness  to be sure your payments are counted and your loans are forgiven.

{"prompt":"I just completed a chapter 13 bankruptcy. Can I apply for a personal loan?","completion":"“Hi, I just completed a chapter 13 bankruptcy and would like to know if I can apply for a personal loan. Thank you.”  Submitted by David N.  Thanks for your question about life (and credit) after bankruptcy. This is a common situation and the good news is that getting  Chapter 13 debt relief  is not fatal for your financial future.  Is a personal loan the right choice?  If you are planning to obtain a personal loan, consider the following before applying:   What’s the point? What will getting the loan do for your situation? Will it help you pay higher interest debt? Do you need it to pay living expenses or other financial goals?  How will you manage the additional financial responsibility of the personal loan?  Are there other options? Can you increase your income, lower your expenses, or a combination of the two?  How will applying for a loan impact your credit score?   Applying for a personal loan  If you feel confident that getting a loan is the right financial choice, consider the following:   Be proactive – get your credit report so you know what the potential lender will see.  Create a budget based on your current situation so you know exactly what you can repay. You likely did this step during the Chapter 13 process. Has anything changed since then?  Shop around and consider all of your potential lenders:  Credit unions (they tend to be more willing to look at your entire situation, not just the bankruptcy)  Online peer lenders  Avoid predatory lenders    What interest rates are being offered?  Are the repayments (of the new loan) manageable considering your Chapter 13 repayment plan?  What time frame is best for repayment? How will that impact your other financial goals?   Getting a personal loan is not a substitute for building a money management strategy to stabilize your financial situation. But if it can help you reduce the “cost of money” by lowering the interest rate on existing debt, it may be a good move. "} 
{"prompt":"How Can I Involve My Kids in Everyday Budgeting and Financial Decisions?","completion":" The home is the perfect place for kids of all ages to learn and practice personal finance. Here are some specific ways you can involve your kids in everyday budgeting and family finances, all while teaching important life lessons.  Consult Your Kids When Making Your Monthly Budget  Let your child know that you’re looking ahead to the next month and ask them for input on the family’s budget. This is their opportunity to give you advance notice of expenses they think are coming up. Maybe there’s a special school or sporting event that has a cost. Maybe their birthday is coming up. Your preteen son may tell you his shoes are getting tight ( again ) and he needs a larger pair of shoes.  Of course, your child may also want to add an item that the family cannot afford at this time. This is a perfect opportunity to teach one of the tougher lessons of personal finance. Some good things that we want need to be delayed so we can meet the family’s needs first.    Involving Your Child in the Budget Is a Win for Both of You  This will help you to craft a budget that looks ahead and foresees expenses, instead of keeping them as a bad surprise during the month. This will help the child by modeling the importance of creating a monthly plan for how the family’s income will be spent, saved, or given away during the coming month. It will also help them with the fundamental skill of thinking ahead and planning for the future. That skill will serve them their whole life.  Tip : A monthly budget is a helpful financial tool. If you’re not yet using it, check out this  SaverLife article .  Give Your Kids Insight into Your Daily Finances and Decision-Making  This is easier than it may sound. Think about what financial tasks and goals you have and then, age-appropriately, let your kids in on those things by talking to them as the task naturally occurs. For example, most parents are encouraging (maybe begging) their kids to turn off the lights when they are not being used to “save electricity.” Now take it a step farther and share with your child the electricity bill. You can note that it’s often higher in the winter when you need to heat the house and discuss what things in the house use electricity. You’re building knowledge and connections between a lifelong task (turning off the lights) and its impact on finances.  Note : Choose topics that are helpful for your child to have a positive lesson in personal finances. Financial information that is stressful or involves conflict should be left to the adults in the family.  Help Your Children Understand How to Find Trusted Financial Resources  Today, marketers and those who make money off of particular products are offering lots of advice. But be aware that they are offering advice that helps them, and not necessarily you. So, who can you trust? The first place I recommend for financial education resources is the federal government’s consumer protection agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  The CFPB’s mission is to make sure “banks, lenders, and other financial companies treat you fairly.” The CFPB has free resources for consumers, parents, and educators on nearly any financial topic you can imagine.  Their goal is to help you “make informed financial decisions and build financial skills.” For teaching personal finance to kids, see their section  Money as You Grow .  Many resources are available in English and Spanish.  Experience Is the Best Teacher  In addition to the ideas above, I’m sure you’ll see many opportunities to involve your child in personal finance and budgeting. They may not thank you now (although some will), but their grown-up selves will surely appreciate and benefit from your efforts. "} 
{"prompt":"Should I itemize my deductions or take the standard deduction?","completion":" The goal of deductions is to lower the amount of taxable income the IRS will use when calculating the amount of tax you owe. The decision of whether to itemize your deductions or take the standard deduction comes down to one question.  Which deduction is bigger and will lower your tax burden more?  Currently, the standard deduction for a single filer is $12,200 and for married filing jointly it’s $24,400. If your itemized deductions equal more than these, you will want to itemize using form Schedule A.  What can I itemize?  Listed on Schedule A, itemized deductions include:  real estate property taxes home mortgage interest charitable contributions state and local income taxes casualty and theft losses  There is a section on the form for Other itemized Deductions. You can find instructions on the  IRS website .  If the total itemized deductions from your Schedule A are less than the standard deduction, use the standard deduction. If the itemized deductions are greater than the standard deduction, use the itemized deduction amount. "} 
{"prompt":"6 Easy Steps to Set a Budget that You’ll Actually Stick To","completion":"Whether it’s something you need or something you want, creating a budget can help you keep your spending in line so you can reach your financial goals.  Creating a budget may seem daunting, but this video walks you through setting up a budget that you can actually stick to. Once you know what your goal is, creating a budget to achieve that goal comes down to six steps:   Know your income : Make sure you’re using your net income (how much money you bring home),  not  your salary. Taxes, insurance, and 401k contributions may all cut into your income before you actually see that money.  Determine your fixed expenses : These are expenses that don’t change much throughout the year, like rent or mortgage, car payments, insurance, and student loans.  Determine your variable expenses : This includes expenses that change based on how much you use them, like your phone bill, groceries, clothes, and entertainment. You have a lot of control over these expenses.  Prioritize : Determine what’s really important to you. What do you feel is truly necessary in your life? Take an honest look at what you truly need, and what you just want. You may find that it’s worth it to you to sacrifice some of your variable expenses in order to reach other financial goals.  Follow your spending and review monthly : Hold yourself accountable by following your spending every month. It’s easy for small expenses to start adding up!  Keep track : Find a way that works for you to track your spending. There are lots of options out there, from old-fashioned pen and paper to an online app.   As the video explains, budgeting is doable; you just need to commit to being disciplined, planning your expenses, and prioritizing them thoughtfully.

Use a  Spending Tracker  Track income and expenses using this easy app for iOS or Android. There’s no need to set up any budgets in advance. Just install the app and start tracking.  Spend it/Write it  Use a good-old fashioned pen and paper to write down what you spend. Try to track daily, missed days usually = missing dollars. Checkbook registers are a cheap and easy way to keep your spending details in one place.  Use a Paper Tracker  Print the tracker and carry it with you during the week. If you don’t write down what you spend right away, be sure to hold on to your receipts so you can put in the details later. Keep receipts and total them up at the end of each week.

{"prompt":"How to Teach Your Kids to Budget for Their First Jobs","completion":" First of all, congratulations! Your teen has their first paying job. This is a milestone and a time where they’ll learn new things about work, life, money, and themselves. This is an excellent time to teach foundational principles and practical budgeting. Your teen can also earn more financial independence.   Save. Spend. Give.  All the things we can do with income boils down to these three essentials.  Save : Setting aside money, which will be spent in the future.  Spend : Buying items or services to meet current needs and wants.  Give : This includes gifts to charities and religious or church-based giving.  Your Teen’s Money Style  Your teen (and you) likely naturally lean towards being a spender, saver or giver. This is your  money style . It’s important to encourage balance. If you have a child who really just wants to spend money, help them see the benefit of saving for a future need or want. Perhaps you have a tender-hearted giver or a devoted saver-only. They’ll need your perspective to understand it’s also healthy to spend for their own needs and wants. Meet your teen where they are at and help them grow from there.  Set Goals for Each Category  Help them to set written goals for each category. They can ask themselves these questions.  Save : What future needs or wants do I need to plan for before they happen?  Spend : What current needs or wants do I have? Give : What values or causes do I want to support?  Practice Budgeting  Every month, before the next month begins, your teen should estimate how much income they expect to earn that month. Then reflect on their written goals and document how much of their money will they save, spend, or give. This can be very simple at first, and can expand as the teen earns more or has more goals. If they work more or less during the month, they can adjust their simple budget to show what actually happened. Here’s a sample:  Jamie’s Budget, April 2021  Income : 10 hours X $12 an hour babysitting = $120        Expense : Where is it going? Save 70% of earnings ($84) for my goal of $240 for an art class in July 2021. Spend 20% of earnings ($36) on one new book & one movie with friends. Give 10% of earnings ($12) for charity or church. This adds up to $120!  You can increase financial independence and support the practical skill of budgeting by giving them more responsibility for their discretionary spending. Discretionary spending is the fun stuff: special clothing, entertainment, etc. They’ll get to practice on a small scale the decisions and choices that grown-ups make when they have limited amounts of money, but many wants. Your child may have to choose between a new clothing item and an evening out with friends (post-pandemic). They may have to decide whether to buy something now at a higher price, or shop around for a sale price. They’ll have to prioritize, which is a key life skill.  Start Simple  These tips are just the beginning, but it is helpful to start simple. Your teen can build a solid, personal finance foundation, through balancing  Save, Spend, and Give , setting goals that address both future and current desires, and monthly budgeting. "} 
{"prompt":"Debt Consolidation: What is it and is it right for me?","completion":"If you’re dealing with multiple loans, chances are you’ve heard of debt consolidation (think of those obnoxious radio or tv ads). But what exactly is debt consolidation? Put simply, debt consolidation allows you to consolidate all of your debts into one payment. This will combine all your debt amounts, and it  may  offer a lower interest rate –  but not always .  Secured or Unsecured?  Debt consolidation comes in different forms, including secured and unsecured. If your debt consolidation is unsecured, that means that it is still a signature loan. If it is secured, you have to put up some asset (like a car or house) as collateral – which you are then at risk of losing. Some people use a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay off credit cards, but in my book, that’s a big risk and can have many consequences including high costs and even foreclosure if you are unable to pay the debt.  Debt Consolidation, Debt Settlement, and Debt Management  There’s a dizzying array of options out there that may help you with your debt. Debt  consolidation , settlement, and management all refer to different processes with different drawbacks and benefits.  Let’s start with debt settlement. This is when you negotiate for a lower rate or balance. Debt management is when an intermediary company negotiates on your behalf with your creditors, then you pay the debt management company and they pay your creditors.  Questions to Ask Before Choosing Debt Consolidation  Depending on your circumstances and the options you have, debt consolidation may or may not be the right choice for you. Here are things I want you to think about and research in making your decision:   What are the fees?  What are the interest rates? Use a  Debt Consolidation Calculator  to check your consolidated rate. Be careful because the rate is sometimes higher on consolidation loans (and don’t forget the fees!).  What is your budget? Use a calculator to make an honest assessment of what you can afford to pay towards debt reduction.  Do you have an emergency fund? Balancing debt reduction and saving is tricky – but my word of advice is to always  put  yourself  in the front of your line . Saving for emergencies, even a small amount, is a good habit to build.   DIY Debt Consolidation  Beyond the many debt consolidation options on the market, I want you to also consider building your own consolidation plan using zero interest cards or short term lower interest loans through a bank or credit union. But as always, make sure you’re still asking yourself the central questions I’ve outlined above.  Your Money Mindset  I’ve often seen that consolidating debt actually leads to acquiring more debt: the newly consolidated debt plus new debt from continuing to use credit cards. Here’s where your money mindset comes into play. Whether or not you opt to use debt consolidation, you may need to shift your behaviors to meet your financial goals and to be successful with tackling your debt. You may find that creating your own debt management plan is best for your money AND your mind.  Where to Learn More  Debt consolidation is complicated, and there’s a lot to consider when deciding if it’s right for you. Nolo, my go-to online resource for legal issues,  walks you through some additional important considerations , including a more in-depth comparison of choosing a secured or unsecured debt consolidation plan. Another great resource is  this article  from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  Whew! That is a TON of information on debt consolidation. Consolidating your debt is a big choice, and I want to make sure you’re equipped to make the right decision for you. "} 
{"prompt":"What’s the difference between money market, savings, and checking accounts?","completion":" Although these types of accounts are similar, they have important differences.   What is a checking account?  A checking account is designed for day-to-day use. There are many options when it comes to checking accounts. The most popular options are free and allow you to make as many withdrawals as you want. Sometimes the bank or credit union will require a monthly automatic deposit into this account, and some checking accounts pay a  very  modest interest rate.  What is a money market account?  A money market account is technically a checking account, but with more restrictions. Money market accounts often have a $1,000 minimum balance requirement. If your balance drops below the minimum requirement, some banks will charge a monthly service charge. You are limited to six withdrawals a month on this account, three of which can be checks. Due to these restrictions, the account pays higher interest than a normal checking account. The interest rate is often tiered, so the more money you have in the account, the higher your interest rate.  What is a savings account?  A savings account also has limited withdrawals, but usually only a $100 minimum in order to avoid a monthly fee. This account generally has a higher interest rate than a checking account, but lower than a money market account.  Other types of bank accounts  Banks and credit unions now offer “hybrids” of each of these accounts. Each account type has their own requirements and benefits to entice you to bank with them. The market is quite competitive and new products are always being added. Shop around to find the account that is best for your banking needs! "} 
{"prompt":"Steps to Get Retirement Ready at Every Age","completion":"You’re never too old or too young to prepare for retirement. Sure, starting early is best (you can do more with less), but if you’re just getting started, focus on what you CAN do rather than what you missed out on.  Here’s the deal.  If you’re in your 20s:  Get ready!  Start NOW and save regularly. Include retirement savings as part of your monthly budget and create a habit of saving. There are a lot of options and choices, but just keep it simple (and consistent). A friend of mine offers some  solid and trusted advice  on getting started early to increase your chances of retiring comfortably, or even EARLY.  If you’re in your 30s:  Get focused!  Start by  running some retirement calculations  to get a snapshot of where you are now and what it will take to reach your goal. It’s easy to think you have plenty of time but I promise that if you take care of your “older self” today, you’ll be happy you did.  If you’re in your 40s:  Get serious!  Do everything you can to shift your savings into high gear. If you are behind, keep debt low and prioritize long term savings. I like  these tips  to help you get on track even if you are starting with no retirement savings at all.  If you’re in your 50s:  Get creative!  If you haven’t started saving you may need to create a plan that includes options for working longer. Numbers matter, so check out tips for the younger folks and then turn your attention to creating the life YOU want in retirement. My favorite book on this topic is  The Number  by Lee Eisenberg. Check it out. (Literally! Save your money and see if you can find it at your local library.)  What does your retirement look like?  “Retirement” means many things, so first decide what it means to you. When I was 44, I realized I was not going to have enough to retire at the traditional age of 67 (my full retirement age according to the  Social Security Administration ) so I knew I would have to come up with a solution. I chose to go back to school and that meant longer work life AND student loans. Now, if I hadn’t been willing to do that I would not be writing to you right now (see, we would have BOTH missed out) but I took the (calculated) risk, found something I love and became an expert. This means that I’m going to be working well into my 70s – but doing something I love! "} 
{"prompt":"What does it mean to “pay yourself first”?","completion":" Hi, I’m Saundra Davis, SaverLife’s financial coach. Let’s talk a little bit about the golden rule of saving:  pay yourself first .  So many people say, “I’m going to wait and save after I’ve paid all my bills and I’ll save what’s left,” but we all know what happens then. Very seldom is there anything left.  So the idea of paying yourself first is to prioritize taking good care of your financial future by putting yourself in the front of your bill-paying line. That’s right, sometimes it’s even helpful to think about paying yourself as a bill that you pay, putting a little bit aside each month. It doesn’t even really matter how much it is.

{"prompt":"My kids are 4 and 7. Is it too late to open a 529?","completion":"“My son is 7 and my daughter is 4. Is it too late to invest in 529 plan for them? What would be a better alternative to save for their college and financial future?”  Submitted by Stella D.  It is never too early or too late to start saving for college (or for anything, for that matter). Here are a few things to keep in mind:  What’s the Big Picture?  Plan your savings with your  entire  financial life in mind. For instance, if you have high-interest debt, create a repayment plan that reduces or eliminates that before you go all-in on saving for college. This is a common dilemma because most of us have multiple financial goals and we want to accomplish them all. Minimizing or eliminating debt will free up more cash to save and will reduce the interest you pay.  With that out of the way, there are a few options to save for college.  Benefits of a 529 Account  A  529 account  is a tax-advantaged savings plan that has many different uses for college or education funding. The tax advantage is that you don’t pay taxes on the investment gains if you use the funds for qualified education expenses.  529 accounts are popular because family members and friends can contribute on birthdays and other occasions. While this may not be exciting to your children when they are young, it will certainly put a smile on their faces when they are off to college.  Most often, the asset allocation (picture a pie chart of different types of investments) begins to lean toward a more conservative approach as your children get older.  Because you are starting later, you may need to be more aggressive with your saving amount to reach your target. Figure out that amount using this  college savings calculator .  Other Options  Other than a 529 account, here are some of your options:   Pre-paid tuition if you know where your child will attend school.  UTMA/UGMA (UGMA stands for the Uniform Gift to Minors Act. UTMA stands for Uniform Transfer to Minors Act) custodial accounts. The tax breaks may not be as generous and you cannot control how your child spends the money once they reach 18 (or 21 in some states).  If your child is earning income, consider a Roth IRA which can be used for qualified education expenses and can serve as a base investment for their future. It’s a good way to start them thinking about saving for retirement while they are young!  Parent retirement accounts  are also an option. Look carefully at all of the impact on your long-term financial preparedness before taking this step.   Building Your Savings Plan  Whew, so many decisions and those little ones grow up so fast. Saving for the future is ALWAYS a good choice and fortunately you have several choices (which is sometimes a challenge, right?). Let me break it down:   How much do you think your child will need? Use that calculator I mentioned above to come up with an estimate.  How much can you afford to save? (Got a budget?)  How many years before your child heads off to college?  Are you likely to need that money for K-12 education?  Is your child likely to be eligible for need-based scholarships?   The  “I Have A Dream” Foundation  provides individualized social, emotional, and academic support to young people from low-income communities from kindergarten all the way through college, along with guaranteed tuition support. This is just one of many programs in the U.S. designed to help families save for college.  As you face all of these facts, keep in mind that even if you are unable to save  all  of the money your child will need to attend college,  research shows that saving a little goes a long way , so choose an approach and then take action.

{"prompt":"How Early Should I Start Talking to My Kids About Money?","completion":" Do you ever wonder what is the right age to talk to your kids about money?  Or what should you be talking to your kids about to help them understand and manage money well?   Talking About Money Is Probably Easier Than You Expect  Most kids are naturally interested in money, or the things that money can buy, at an early age. This may come in the form of the tempting candy in the grocery check-out line or a desire for french fries from the drive-thru. You can use this natural interest to help your children build foundational financial thinking skills that will help them throughout life.   Use Daily Life Events to Teach Your Children Key Financial Principles  Where Does Money Come From?  It’s understandable that children don’t always know where money comes from. To them, our cash or credit card just appears from our purse or wallet. Make the connection for them that the money you spend is earned through work. Maybe you leave the home to go to work, or work from home, or maybe your work is taking care of these precious children. Whatever the case, help them understand the connection.  Another way we receive money is from gifts. If they receive a birthday gift, they learn that money sometimes comes as a gift.    Explain Wise Purchase Decisions  When you are out shopping, explain the choices that you are making when you choose one product over another. You are looking at the price, how much you need, the quality of the item, and how suitable the item is for how you’ll use it. If they’re trying to choose between two items, talk with them about the benefits of each item, and the downsides of the item. Ask them what is most important to them. This helps them flex their decision-making muscles.  Working Toward a Long-Term Goal  Another lesson to share with your children is that it can take time to meet a financial goal. Perhaps you’re building an emergency fund. You can involve your children by telling them about your goal and sharing specific examples of the trade-offs you make to put money aside for those goals. When you reach a milestone toward your goal, celebrate with them. Make some noise and do a happy dance together!  Understanding that many of our goals take time and perseverance, and even that there are setbacks along the way, will help them in many areas of life.  Teach Them about  Needs Versus Wants  This can be tough for children. In the moment, a drive-thru french fry may seem like a need. Here you have the opportunity to teach them that food is a need, but the particular type or method of getting food is a want. For example, you could help them see that for the same amount of money you can make many more french fries at home using the bag of frozen fries and even more using a bag of potatoes bought at the grocery store. This small teaching moment will help them see the difference between a need (the priority for your family’s money) versus a want (a treat and nice-to-have after our needs are met).  Here’s the example I might use to talk through with your kids:  French Fry Options Medium Size (Drive-Thru): ¼ of a pound for $2.99 Frozen Fries (Grocery Store): 2 pounds for $2.96 Bag of Potatoes (Grocery Store): 5 pounds for $2.67  Ask your kids which they would choose and why, and talk to them about the trade-offs of time, convenience, quality, quantity, and money.  Get Some Fun Help from Kid Experts  Sesame Street has a fun website called  Finances for Kids . On the site, there are videos of Elmo learning about these financial fundamentals. What will Elmo decide to buy with his dollar? What will Elmo learn about where money comes from? Cookie Monster and kids relate to how it can be tough to wait for things they want. There are also printables for parents and caregivers and other resources to help your little one.  Lifelong Financial Learning  Your money discussions with your children will change and evolve as they grow older. The conversation may change from the candy at the grocery check-out, to the latest fashionable clothing, shoes, or technology, to money decisions related to work, college, or a trade school. However, the key principles are understanding where money comes from, how to make wise purchase decisions, and needs versus wants. These will be constant themes that will serve them well at any age.

{"prompt":"Your Guide to Getting Out of Debt","completion":" There are a couple of ways to get out of debt and back on track. It may seem overwhelming, but you can do this!  It’s time to budget  To start with, make a budget. Total up all your monthly take home pay.  Next, subtract all of your expenses. You will want to subtract your housing, car, gas, food, entertainment, clothing, and insurance, just to name a few.  Where is your money going?  If you aren’t sure where your money went, go to your checking account online. Take a 30-day period and categorize all your spending. If it’s groceries, put the dollar amount under the heading “groceries.” Do the same for eating out, snacks and drinks, entertainment, clothes, or any other category you discover.  Add up the columns so you have an idea of what you spend on each one for a month.  Put it all together  Put your expense figures into the budget. Then subtract the total spending from the total income. Hopefully you have a positive number. If not, go through each category and decide where you can cut back until you do have a positive number.  Doing this will allow you to free up extra money to put towards your debt, and will also keep you from going further into debt because you are running out of money each month.  Your debt reduction plan  To set up a debt reduction plan, I recommend  this free website . You will put in all of your debts, including the dollar amount owed, the interest rate, and the minimum payment. From there, you put in the extra money you have to apply each month. It will calculate how long it will take you to get out of debt, and even print you a calendar showing how much to pay monthly on each debt.  Is credit counseling right for you?  Another option is to work with a non-profit credit counseling agency.  They will negotiate lower payments, a lower interest rate, or both with your creditors. From there, you pay them a small monthly fee along with the total new monthly payments and they make your payments for you.  This can be extremely helpful if you are feeling overwhelmed, are receiving phone calls, or can’t get out from under the debt due to huge interest rates.  You can find a legitimate credit counseling agency with the  National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) .  The burden of debt can be overwhelming. Making a plan to tackle this debt can help lower your stress level and allow you to see a way out. With some hard work, you can be debt free.   We’re all rooting for you! "} 
{"prompt":"5 Tips to Stay Out of Debt on Black Friday","completion":" Your No-Debt Black Friday Survival Guide  As a veteran, I often get eye rolls from my kids when I use military analogies to describe events. But as a financial coach, I can’t help but see Black Friday as an epic battle. You’re knee-deep in the trenches of holiday shopping goals and you’re experiencing the rapid fire of sales ads coming at you from everywhere: TV ads, mail, emails, texts, and Facebook ads (my daughter says Facebook is like Instagram for old people, so fill in the blank to whatever social media site you use). Without a survival plan for your finances, you are one flashy Black Friday sales ad away from going into debt. You have to prepare both financially and mentally for Black Friday.     I know from experience. I was going through “mom” guilt right as I saw a flashy Black Friday sales ad for a $150 toy that is a “must have” if you “really love your 3-year-old kid.” This was too much to bear and I bought the toy. At Christmas all she did was play with the box and completely ignored the toy. To date, that’s the most expensive box I’ve ever bought.   Below is your “No-Debt Black Friday Survival Guide” with the mission to protect your finances from debt at all costs!  1. Assess Your Resources  Write down who you want to buy gifts for on Black Friday. Review your spending plan to see how much you can spend on Black Friday without going into debt or compromising your other financial goals. Once you have this number, write it in large print, circled and highlighted on top of a sheet of paper and go to step 2.  2. Define the Mission  Using the sheet from Step 1, write down exactly what you want to buy on Black Friday BEFORE Black Friday and why you must buy this item. Write down how buying this item will impact your ability to reach other goals like getting out of debt, buying a house, or even finishing your holiday shopping without going into debt. Decide if it’s really worth it. Remember: A sale is not an excuse to buy an item you cannot afford.  3. Examine Your Enemies for Weaknesses  If after doing #2 you still want to shop on Black Friday, the next step is to examine your enemy (the store) for weakness, which are sales ads. Start early and research your favorite store websites along with  Black   Friday   websites  to find the best deals.  4. Map Out Your Shopping Battle Plan  Map out where and when you are purchasing your items. You are committing to only purchase the items on your plan and nothing else as well as to stick to your budget. If you need motivation, write “No Debt Black Friday” at the top of your plan to keep you focused.  5. Triage If Needed  If you have a Mercedes shopping list with a Kia holiday budget, you may have to triage. This means deciding who you’re going to give gifts to and how much you’re going to spend on each person.  Get creative! One of the best gifts I ever got was a voucher from a friend offering free babysitting. And one of my friends gave me an awesome homemade cake. If you have young children or super cute animals, use these weapons of mass cuteness to your advantage:  Snap pictures on your phone and print them at your local CVS, Walgreens, or Rite Aid or use your home printer Shop for inexpensive picture frames at your local dollar store or thrift store   Give as inexpensive gifts!  With a survival plan you can emerge from Black Friday victoriously conquering tempting sales ads without debt.  "} 
{"prompt":"How to Pay Down Your Debt","completion":"“The ONE aspect of our financial lives that causes the most distress”  (cue Jeopardy music)  “What is DEBT?”  Correct!  Yup, you guessed it (or maybe you’ve lived it).  Debt is the number one cause of financial stress in the U.S.  The “right” way to pay off that debt is a constant source of confusion. Even financial experts can’t agree on the best approach to tackle this debt trap. Fortunately, we have a tool that makes setting up a debt elimination plan a walk in the park.  PowerPay  is a free tool that helps you quickly set up your debt payment plan AND shows you exactly how long it will take to be debt free. You’ll input your outstanding balance and the interest rate for each of your credit accounts and like MAGIC you’ll have a repayment plan that puts you on track to no debt.  Two strategies for paying down your debt  There are two basic approaches to debt elimination.  The “avalanche” method : paying the highest interest first. This saves you money in the long run because you’ll get out of paying more in interest. The avalanche method is usually the best method if you are trying to reduce the amount of interest you pay.  The “snowball” method : Pay off your smallest balances first, as quickly as possible. As you pay down smaller debts, you’ll have more money to put towards your bigger balances. you may want to choose the snowball method if you think getting some early wins will help motivate you.  Should I save or pay down my debt?  Many people ask, “Should I save OR pay down my debt?” We recommend a balanced approach to these two financial goals. It may make sense to reduce your saving while you pay down the debt, but don’t ELIMINATE savings. Remember,  paying yourself first  is the golden rule. Plus, you need emergency savings in case something unexpected happens. Even if you just save $20 each month, you will continue the savings habit you started.

{"prompt":"How to track and trim your subscription costs","completion":" The subscription industry is huge in our world today! The average person spent  $237.33/month on subscription services  in 2018. These services include internet, cell phone coverage, streaming services for video and music, food delivery, health and fitness apps, and more.  With the vast number of subscriptions you can sign up for and the large portion of your monthly budget that they can consume, it’s important to keep track of all of your subscriptions. Be sure to cancel or pause any you aren’t using to save yourself money.   While there are apps and websites to help you keep track of your subscriptions, sometimes for a fee, I think you can learn a lot by keeping track of them yourself. Not only can you do it for free, it also will give you better insight into what you are spending your money on and whether or not some of your services are worth it. There are two methods that I recommend to my clients when trying to keep track of all their subscriptions in our crazy world.  Build a Subscription Tracking Calendar  The first method is to create a subscription tracking calendar. Using the calendar app on your phone or your computer, create calendar notifications for each of your subscription services. If a subscription is monthly, create a notification each month on the day it is due. In the event name, include the service and the amount. If you don’t have the subscription on auto pay, include a reminder a day or two before to be sure that you pay the bill. If the bill is annual, add a notification for the date each year that it renews. Again, add the amount and set a reminder for yourself so you can take the bill into consideration and adjust your budget. Give your subscription reminders all the same color so you can see at a glance when looking at your calendar when they are due.    This method of tracking subscriptions may seem a bit tedious. But if your subscriptions aren’t automatically billed to a card or account, or you are finding yourself repeatedly with more month than money, this method can help you find areas to tighten your budget. It can also ensure you don’t miss payments.  Create a Subscriptions Spreadsheet  If most of your subscriptions are automatically paid or you don’t want to clutter up your calendar, I recommend building a subscriptions spreadsheet. You can do this in whatever spreadsheet software you regularly use. Key pieces of information to include in your spreadsheet are:  what the subscription is how much it costs the frequency that you are billed for it (monthly, quarterly, annually the payment due date what account the bill is paid from if it is paid automatically the web address for managing your subscription and (optionally) your login information  Update your spreadsheet whenever you sign up for a new subscription so that you have accurate information.  This method allows you to keep more information about your subscriptions and to track your spending over time. This can give you insight into your spending habits and allow you to reflect on your different services and how much use you get out of them.  No matter what method you choose, find one that will work for you and that you can maintain. It’s also important to remember when trial periods end, and you will start paying for a subscription. This will allow you to cancel the service if you don’t find yourself using it. In today’s world, subscription services seem to be a fact of life. Developing a strategy for managing them that works for you and that you can maintain is key! "} 
{"prompt":"Why You Need a Financial GPS","completion":" The last partof my morning routine goes like this:   Get in the car. Open Pandora (the free version, of course). Select the Nelly & St. Lunatics channel.  Open the Waze app. Select location labeled as Work.  Back out of my driveway; I’m on the way!  You might think that it’s silly for me to use a navigation or GPS app to get to work every day. You may be wondering if I even know my way around where I live! A GPS app helps me overcome issues that arise while en route: traffic building up, accidents, flooding, or objects in the road. It alerts me to problems that are arising and suggests a different route if needed. It doesn’t change the location I travel to, but it helps me adapt my path so that I arrive more quickly.  Your budget or your spending plan is your financial GPS .  What’s Your Location?  In your budget, the location you’re traveling toward is your  financial goal . Take the time to soul search and figure out what resonates for you. In my experience as an Accredited Financial Counselor, not having established goals is the biggest mistake I’ve seen when it comes to budgeting. Goals are motivational and exciting. They help keep you on track. Without goals, it’s very difficult to follow your plan because you don’t have anything set that you’re working toward. Without financial goals, it’s like taking a drive with nowhere to go.  You budget to reach the goals that are important to you. You budget so you have less stress, build memories on a family vacation, and spend time with your children when you buy an ice cream cone once a month. Every single one of those goals is important not only to you but to your family. This is what you’re traveling toward in your budget and is the location you arrive at.  What’s Your Route?  The route you travel is the budget or spending plan itself. When traffic is building up, a GPS helps to send you a slightly different path. In other words, your budget adapts to your circumstances. In order to be as effective as possible, these updates need to happen in real time. Your budget is something you need to revisit and revise regularly.  When you’re first building your budget, you want to get as specific as possible to flesh out the details. Make a list of all of the bills you have to pay on a monthly basis. You and I both know that you have many more expenses to cover, so doing this only gets you part of the way there. What else do you pay for?  It’s very difficult to fully understand where your money is going without looking in the past. Look over your bank, credit card, and payment apps (such as CashApp, Venmo, and PayPal) over a set period of time. Since we’re in the month of May right now, I’d suggest looking at April 1 through April 30. Add up your variable expenses within categories — these are the expenses that fluctuate from month to month. Groceries, dining out, gas, and entertainment are some examples of variable expense categories. Repeat for at least one other month, for example, March 1 through 31. Create an average by adding the category totals and dividing by the number of months used in the spending review.   Here’s an example of how you’d figure out your average monthly spending on groceries:  April groceries = $753.20 March groceries = $748.50 February groceries = $588.10 Grocery total for three months = $2,089.80 Average grocery cost (divide total cost by three) = $696.60  Now you need to ask yourself some questions.   Which of these need to stay the same? What categories cause you discomfort when you look at the numbers? Do you want to change those categories? What changes can you reasonably make given your family’s needs and activities? Gas is a difficult variable expense to change in most cases because you need to get to work, drop your children off at daycare, and run other errands essential for your household. Other categories might make sense to change, though. Dining out and entertainment are often categories that can be trimmed back.  What expenses do you cover over the year? Back to school, holidays, birthdays, and property taxes are some of the big ones that come to my mind. It’s wise to prepare over time; think of what your game plan will be in your budget. Some of these may even be the financial goals you’re working toward. Remember, this is the location you’re traveling toward, so allocating some of your income for these goals is key.  Do You Need to Reroute Your Path?  When there’s an unexpected expense or change in income, sometimes our budget has to reroute us just as a GPS would guide us around a traffic build-up. It’s okay if you can’t save the $100 you planned this month because you can use your budget to save $25 extra over the next 4 months to make up for lost ground. The ability to change routes is the great part about using a budget!   You’re still travelingto work, but you might use a different highway. Only now, you’re not stuck inthat traffic jam for an hour; you’re arriving on time. You might adapt a couplemonths of your budget, but you’re still able build a sandcastle at the lakewith your daughter on your family vacation. "} 
{"prompt":"4 Questions to Figure Out How Much Money You Need to Retire","completion":" That is a hard question, which I can only answer with a lot more questions!  Question 1: Timeline  The first question you need to ask yourself is: when do you want to retire? This will help you figure out how much time you have to get where you want to be.  Question 2: Expenses  Second, what will your living expenses be when you retire? Will you be in a high cost of living area? Do you expect you will have paid off your home already? Or will you have a mortgage or rent payment? Figure out the same for your car. And don’t forget food, utilities, gas and car insurance, along with medical insurance and medical bills.  Question 3: Retirement Goals  Next, what are your retirement goals? What is it that you want to do in retirement? Do you see a life of travel or do you want to stay home? Will you want to do some upgrading to your home or start that business that you always wanted to start? You need to factor in all of these expenses in addition to your normal, day-to-day expenses.   Question 4: Income  Determine what you can expect your Social Security income to be. You can do that by going to the  Social Security Administration website  and registering with MySocialSecurity. This will allow you access projections from the Social Security Administration.  Also, will you have a pension from a former employer or are you building your own savings in a 401(k) or IRA, or both? This is where your savings should be. If you haven’t started yet, the sooner you start saving the better.  Your time is worth more than your money  when it comes to retirement savings.   Next Steps for Retirement Planning  This can all be a little (or a lot!) overwhelming. There are experts who can help you run the math on all of this, and they can make projections on the earnings of your savings. This is where time comes into play. The more time you have to save, the harder your money can move you toward your retirement goals.  If it’s within your financial limits, I would recommend a Certified Financial Planner who is Fee Only. They have software that can calculate what you will need in order to get the retirement you want. Certified Financial Planners can be expensive, so shop around and also check with your HR Dept. You might have an employee assistance program that would be discounted. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Prepare for a Family Financially","completion":"Since we know that everything affects everything, let’s talk about how our financial lives are impacted by our families. Over 80% of SaverLife members live with at least one other person—be that a parent, child, partner, or roommate—and even if you are single, you may have heard that having a baby can really break the budget (that may be enough to freak you out!). Every family is unique and every family has different priorities and goals. You may be saving for your kids’ education, your dream wedding, a family vacation, or a safe place for your kids to grow up.  Every change in family structure, whether you are getting married, moving in with a partner, or having children—is a big financial decision that involves navigating a complicated financial landscape. Here are some ideas for icebreakers to start important conversations about family changes.  Getting Married  If you’re preparing for a new marriage or partnership, here are some questions I think you should spend some time answering for yourself, and also discussing candidly with your partner:   What is your current financial situation?  How do you live with money now?  What is your money “profile”? Are you a saver or a spender?  What financial expectations do you have for your partner? These could be expectations about the decisions they’ll make or their financial behaviors.  How will you handle  differences in money habits and attitudes ?  How will you determine individual and shared financial priorities?   If you’re able to talk honestly about these issues and feel confident that you’re on the same page with your partner, that’s a really good place to start your financial journey together.  Your Growing Family  Likewise, having or adopting a child will impact all aspects of your financial life and brings its own sets of challenges and rewards. Here are some more questions that you should spend time answering:   What are your core values about money and family?  What adjustments are you willing to make to accommodate this change?  How will you address unexpected health issues, special needs, job changes, and income fluctuations?   In addition to these big-picture questions, there are also some logistical issues that you need to sort out, including:   Medical expenses: What is covered by your insurance? What are the gaps?  Cash flow: What will change?  Insurance: What must change?  Taxes (BONUS!): Your cute little tax deduction!  Estate planning and guardianship arrangements: Who will take care of your little one if you can’t?  Long-term savings: What do you hope to provide for your child for college? (And what are your own expectations for retirement?)   With a baby, there are both one-time expenses and ongoing expenses. How will you address both? A cool resource from  BabyCenter  can help you come up with a rough estimate of first-year baby costs.  Of course it’s not possible to think about everything, but you can plan for changes you are anticipating (even if they are far off into the future) by taking a few steps to build your financial security.

{"prompt":"What Will Hurt Your Credit Score?","completion":"    When you are working hard to build your credit score, it’s important to do things that will help your score go up. But it’s equally important to understand what will hurt your score. When you understand what can hurt your credit score, you can change your behavior and take steps to avoid certain actions so that your score continues to grow. Here are four things that can hurt your credit score. Keep these in mind as you manage your money.  1. Paying Late or Missing Payments  Your payment history makes up 35% of your FICO credit score. Making your payments late or missing payments altogether will hurt your credit score. This factor is the largest single portion of your credit score, so each payment you make or miss can have a big impact. Missing your payments also signals to lenders that you are a risky borrower and might have more debt than you can manage.  To avoid missing and late payments that drag down your score, be sure to only put charges on your credit card that you can pay off. Also, do not borrow money unless you can make the payments. If something happens and you are unable to make a payment on time, reach out to your lender or creditor. They may be able to adjust your due date so you can pay on time and maintain your credit score.  2. Using Too Much of Your Credit  Your credit usage accounts for 30% of your FICO score and using too much of your available credit can hurt your score. Creditors look at your credit utilization ratio, or how much of your credit that you are using compared to how much credit you have, to determine if you are a risky borrower. Ideally, creditors want to see you use less than 30% of your available credit.  To keep your credit usage from negatively impacting your credit score, aim to use less than 30% of your available credit. So, if you have two credit cards, each with a $500 limit, you have a total available credit of $1,000. Do your best to keep your total usage below $300 to keep your credit usage from hurting your credit score.  3. Opening Too Many New Accounts  Another thing that can lower your credit score is opening too many new accounts in a short period of time. New accounts make up 10% of your FICO credit score. Opening too many accounts at once causes lenders to worry that you may be taking on too much debt and causes your score to drop.  Instead of opening several accounts all at once, just open new accounts when you actually need them. And be sure that you have a plan in place to make your payments. This will help keep your credit score higher.  4. Closing Credit Cards  While it may seem counterintuitive, closing credit card accounts can actually hurt your credit score. Fifteen percent of your FICO credit score comes from your length of credit history. If you close your older credit cards because you aren’t using them anymore, this actually shortens the length of your credit history, and hurts your score. Closing a credit card also decreases your available credit, which can in turn increase the percentage of your total credit you use.  Remember, you want to keep your credit usage under 30%, so closing a card can hurt your credit score in this area as well.  Instead of closing a credit card, just don’t use it. You can put it in a drawer or another safe place and hold on to it. This will keep your credit history length intact and also will not increase your credit utilization ratio. This will help keep your credit score up.  Managing Your Credit Score  It’s important to understand what can hurt your credit score and how you can protect yourself. By paying your bills on time, managing how much credit you use and how many accounts you open, and by keeping your cards open even if you don’t use them, you will be well on your way to building good credit. Credit is a great tool to have on your personal finance journey. And using your credit responsibly can help you as you work towards your financial goals.

{"prompt":"How Distinguishing Between Needs and Wants Can Help You Build a Better Budget","completion":" In order to create a budget that not only works, but that you can thrive on, it helps to consider your needs and wants. It can be hard initially to see any of your spending as a want because you can’t see your life without it. But if you take a step back and evaluate your needs and wants, you will find ways to budget better. This will have a positive impact on your financial life as a whole.  What is a Need?  A need is a good or service that you must have in order to survive. The number of needs a person has is limited. For the most part, needs are consistent from person to person. This category includes shelter, clothing, food, gas and electricity, transportation, and healthcare.  What is a Want?  A want is something that you desire to make your life better or more fulfilled, but doesn’t impact your immediate survival.  Wants can include eating out, entertainment, travel, gym memberships, designer clothing, and anything else that you would like in your life. Unlike needs, which cover a more limited range of expenses, wants are limitless and vary greatly from person to person.  It’s important to remember that some basic expenses are a need but can also become wants depending on circumstances. Transportation, for example, is a need at the basic level. You need a subway pass or a car to get to work, get groceries, and take your kids to school. You don’t, however, need to go all of these places in a luxury car. That is a want.  Dividing Your Expenses  Now that you understand the difference, divide up your expenses as either needs or wants. To do this, look at all of your monthly spending and give each expense the category of need or want. Remember that you may need your cell phone to communicate, so it can be labeled a need. But no matter how much you feel like you can’t live without it, your streaming service is probably a want.   If you aren’t sure if an expense is a need or a want, it can help to think about it from a slightly different perspective. You can apply the MoSCoW model, which stands for Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have, to the expense. If the expense is a Must have, it is a need. If it is a Should have or a Could have, it is a want. But if it is a Won’t have, then you can cut it from your budget. As you work on your budget, you can prioritize the Should have spending over the Could have spending to incorporate your values into your budget.   Building Your Budget   Knowing the difference between your wants and your needs can help you develop a budget you can actually stick to. To start, define your income. This will let you know how much you can spend and save in a given month.  Next, budget for all your needs. Start by subtracting your necessary monthly spending from your income. Once all of your needs are accounted for, you can start adding your wants into your budget. Include your high-value wants into your budget first. This will allow you to cover the expenses on the things you really value before worrying about the things that aren’t as important.  A Few Things to Remember  Needs and wants can change over time as your circumstances change, so be flexible and consider your budget often.  Remember to factor debt repayment into your budget. It may not feel like a need, but to keep your credit score up, stay out of collections, and pay less interest over time, those payments still need to be made. Saving is also not necessarily a need or want, but something you should factor into your budget.   If you make sure that your needs are taken care of first, you will be able to use what is leftover to cover some of your wants. This will help you create a sustainable budget, move your personal finances forward, and reach your personal finance goals. "} 
{"prompt":"Grab a Friend! Social Strategies to Help You Save","completion":" There is strength in numbers! This is especially true when you’re trying to reach your goals and change behaviors. Weight Watchers uses this principle to support healthy eating, and Alcoholics Anonymous uses it to encourage sober living. Emerging research shows that peer support can increase your confidence and sense of control. Social support also makes you more likely to succeed in changing your habits. By participating in social savings strategies, you can capture these same benefits with your financial goals and savings habits.  Socializing your financial goals and savings strategies is when you get together with people to support each other and fulfill your aspirations. These peer support groups can be loose and informal with your friends to help each other save. They can also be formal and structured with agreed-upon savings amounts. Social strategies can include technology, but they don’t need to.  Let’s explore some options for getting social with your financial goals and savings strategies. These strategies can help you save more by providing mutual accountability, shared support, and peer learning.  Vision board party  A vision board is a collage of visual images or words that represent your financial goals or dreams. You can make one by hand using magazine cutouts, photos, or stickers on a poster board. You can make one digitally through a website like Pinterest. Creating a financial vision board with your friends can be fun. But it’s also a tangible way to see and support each others’ goals and plan how to achieve them.  Savings Club  Social savings clubs are small groups of people with similar savings goals who commit to gathering together and regularly saving a specific amount for a period of time.  For example, if members of your group are saving $600 for an emergency savings fund over six months, each individual commits to save $100 by each monthly meeting. Alternatively, your group could commit to doing something like the 52-week money challenge where you gradually increase your savings by a dollar a week over a whole year.  Lending Circle  Lending circles are when a small group of friends or family saves together and lends each other money. The group agrees on a monthly amount that each member contributes. Each month, a new member of the lending circle receives the “loan” until everyone in the group gets paid.  If a lending circle has 10 members who contribute $100 each month, each member receives $1,000 over 10 months.  Financial Support Group  In a financial support group, members provide each other with emotional support. They share information and personal experiences related to financial goals, saving habits, and relationships with money. Peer-led financial circles are collaborative and creative experiences that can increase self-awareness and self-confidence, and in turn your financial health.  Socially-Networked Savings Account  Online savings accounts like  SmartyPig  allow you to announce your financial goals to the world, network with other savers, and ask for help from friends and family.  –  The idea behind social saving is that the more support you get, the more successful you will be in reaching your financial goals. You can mix and match these options or get creative with other possibilities. Many studies (as well as my own personal experiences) show that you’re more likely to complete a goal if someone is holding you accountable for it and providing you with emotional and practical support. Saving can be more fun and meaningful when you involve your friends and family on your financial journey! "} 
{"prompt":"Should I use money in a mutual fund to fix my basement?","completion":"“I have some money in a mutual account that I transferred from an IRA account. I want to use some of this money to fix my basement. Should I?”  Submitted by Pauline B.  I’m going to have to make a few assumptions here to respond to your question.  It seems you transferred funds from an IRA into a mutual fund (taxable) account. To do this, you may have faced tax consequences if you weren’t at least 59½ years old (the penalty-free withdrawal age). If your mutual fund is not an IRA or other tax-advantaged account, the only decision you need to make is whether basement renovation is your financial priority.  There is no “right” answer about what you should or should not do with your money. The real question is, what is your overall plan for your resources? What impact will using the money have and what would happen if you don’t fix the basement? When my coaching clients are faced with a decision I ask them to do the following:   Write the pros and cons of the idea/change (in your case, fixing the basement).  Write the pros and cons of doing nothing (in your case, keeping the money in your account).   If your cash flow is good and you don’t have other financial concerns, which of the options is more satisfying for you? Once you make that decision, establish a budget for the repairs and decide how much you want to keep in the mutual fund. "}

{"prompt":"Are there debt consolidation companies for poor credit scores?","completion":" Submitted by Sara K.  A Debt Management Plan (DMP) that is offered by a non-profit credit counseling agency can be an excellent tool for getting out of debt. Anyone can use these plans, whether they have poor credit or great credit. Credit cards, collections, and medical debt are eligible for these programs.  How a Debt Management Plan works  Every month, you make a payment to the agency, and then the agency in turn sends a payment to each of your creditors. That means that every 30 days, the creditor is getting a payment.  Because you are working with a DMP and not going to a debt settlement company or filing for bankruptcy, your creditors are motivated to work with you. Often, they will either lower the monthly payment they are requesting, lower the interest rate, or both! Each creditor tells the plan what they are willing to do.  You are paying back the full amount of principal, but with a lowered interest rate. That makes it easier to tackle this debt much more quickly. By law, each credit card must be paid in full in 60 months.  How a Debt Management Plan can affect your credit  The DMP does not report to the three major credit bureaus. However,  because the debt remains with your creditors, they continue to report the payment every 30 days. This can build your credit history.    If you are already behind when you come into the plan, some of the creditors will even age up the account once they have received two to four payments. This is basically a fresh start, as they will no longer report you as late. If the card isn’t eligible for a re-age, you are encouraged to slowly make up the past due amount by paying a little extra each month. The late fees stop when your credit card is enrolled in the program, so paying $10-$20 month will make a difference.   Your credit cards will be closed when they go into the plan. You might see a small dip in your credit score because of this. But because you are continuing to make a monthly payment you can afford, you are building a great credit history. And because the interest rate is lower and you’re paying back so much more of the amount you borrowed, your credit score will most likely rebound and improve. Payment history and amount owed make up 65% of the calculation for your credit score. A DMP helps in both of these areas.  How much does a Debt Management Plan cost?  There is a small fee associated with plan. The state you live in will determine that fee. These plans are administered by non-profit agencies, but they do have to keep the lights on! The savings of interest on the credit cards will likely cover the cost. Plus, the counselor you work with will be able to disclose this information to you before you enter the program.  If you’re interested, find a  non-profit Debt Management Plan administrator in your area .    "}

{"prompt":"I want to buy a house, but my credit isn’t good. What can I do?","completion":" I want to buy a house, but I have bad credit. Should I file bankruptcy? What should I do?  Submitted by Marcella S.  Buying a home is many people’s idea of achieving the American Dream. But the road to homeownership can be stressful, confusing, and overwhelming. When I purchased my first home, I had no idea about the home buying process. I experienced all three feelings as I went through the process for the first time. Being prepared to purchase a home is particularly beneficial when buying a house for the first time.   Get Mortgage Ready  You must first become mortgage ready to purchase a home. Three primary steps convey mortgage readiness to a financial institution. One, all lenders review the borrower’s credit history and credit scores from all three credit bureaus and choose the middle rating. This is known as a tri-merge. It’s a good idea for you to  pull all three credit reports  for free ahead of time. This way you know what aspects of your credit report needs correcting. Second, they analyze your capacity to repay the loan by looking at your debt to income ratio. Third, there is a review of the collateral value (the house) you are buying to determine what it’s worth.  Each financial institution sets its criteria for qualified credit history and credit scores, debt ratios, and collateral values. So you may need to shop around with a few lenders before you find one that will work with you.   Options for Low Credit  If you don’t have good credit, you may be required to have additional funding and an alternative form of credit like the following:  Larger Down Payment : A down payment reduces the risk for the lender. You have skin in the game. They have a buffer. Cash Reserves : Even with a sizable down payment, it’s helpful to have ample cash reserves on hand. Rent History : Be able to verify that you’ve paid your rent-on time consistently for 12 to 24 months.    Is bankruptcy a good option?  If you file bankruptcy, that will only make your credit worse. So that’s probably not a good idea if you want to achieve your objective of purchasing a home in the near future.  I wish you the best in your homeownership pursuit! "} 
{"prompt":"What is the Health Insurance Marketplace?","completion":" The Health Insurance Marketplace is an online system run by each state that lets people compare options and shop to  find an affordable health insurance plan  that works for them.   Through the online Health Insurance Marketplace, you can look to see what options are available if you want to purchase insurance. With the Health Insurance Marketplace, you can compare plans and their costs in terms of premiums, deductibles, and how much you can expect to pay out-of-pocket. You’ll also be able to find out if you qualify for any form of public health insurance. Depending on your income level, you might qualify for Medicaid. Any dependent children in your household might qualify for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). If you are over the age of 65, you can find out about your Medicare options.  By shopping the Health Insurance Marketplace, you’ll also find out if you qualify for two kinds of savings:  Advanced premium tax credits, which bring down your monthly health insurance premiums. Cost sharing reductions, which lower your out of pocket costs, like deductibles and copays. If you qualify for a cost sharing reduction, you can only use it if you enroll in a Silver plan.   Nearly 9 out of 10 people who enroll in a Marketplace plan qualify for at least one kind of savings. New data shows that in 2020, at least  one third of people can find a plan for less than $10/month .   After you’ve done your research and compared plans, you can enroll in your new health insurance plan online through the Health Insurance Marketplace. "} 
{"prompt":"6 Steps to Become Debt-Free","completion":" Think of a goal that you’ve set for yourself. Maybe there’s a book that you want to finish, you want to start exercising three days per week, or you want to take the first step in changing careers. Those are all great goals, and there is one more that I want to put on your radar.  I want to talk about a practical goal that many people work towards every day: Living debt-free. For some people, this goal might seem more daunting than the others. For other people, living debt-free is a boring or tiresome goal. The truth is, it’s one of the most important goals you can have, and one that is very possible to reach.  The first thing we need to do to get out of debt is to understand what debt is. Simply put by Oxford Languages: debt is “the state of owing money.” Owing money on a car, student loans, credit cards, etc. puts you in debt. It may sound scary, but remember, it is possible to get out of debt and live debt-free. Just like with any goal, getting out of debt and staying out of debt takes work and commitment. Here are some suggestions that you can use to reach your debt-free goal.  1. Determine how much you owe  Add up all of your debt. Then decide how much you can pay toward your debt each month. You can determine how long it will take to pay off your debt by dividing how much you owe by how much you will pay each month. If you owe $1,000 and you pay $100 toward that debt each month, it will take about 10 months to pay off your debt. ($1,000/$100 = 10 months)  2. Determine your cash flow  It is important to know how much money is coming in as well how much is going out. Once you know where your money is going, you can adjust your cash flow to minimize extra costs so that you can put more money toward your debt.  3. Create a spending plan  A spending plan helps to keep you on track as you work toward your goal of living debt-free. It prioritizes  needs and wants , and it helps make your cash flow more predictable.  4. Save for emergencies  Sometimes the unexpected happens, and sometimes the unexpected is unexpectedly expensive. It helps to have a safety net, just in case. This is another area where a spending plan and adjusting your cash flow comes in handy. In addition to paying off your debt, set aside at least 10% of your income in a savings account. This may not be possible right away, but it is important to start by setting aside as much as you can to help with emergencies.  5. Find a financial coach  It is much easier to reach a goal if you have an accountability partner to help you! A financial coach will help you with these steps and more so that you don’t have to go it alone.  6. Be patient  It took a while to accumulate debt, so it will take a while to get out of it. Just keep working toward your goal and you can reach it!  Working toward living debt-free can seem like daunting goal, but it is attainable and important. With hard work and commitment, you can live debt-free! "}

{"prompt":"Do I need to file a tax return if my only income is Social Security?","completion":" Submitted by anonymous.  That’s a great question, as many Americans’ only source of income is Social Security. Social Security income is taxed for federal and state income tax purposes. If your earned income exceeds IRS 2019 filing guidelines, you are required to file a tax return with the IRS and in most states.  Do I need to file a state tax return?  State income tax is limited to earned income in some states, like North Dakota, where state income tax rate is 1.1%. Some states exempt earned income altogether. These include Alaska, Wyoming, Washington, South Dakota, Florida, Nevada, and Texas (as well as Tennessee, which only taxes interest).  Do I need to file a federal tax return?  Under 2019 IRS filing guidelines, the minimum income amount at which you need to file depends on two main factors. The two factors are status and age. Status means whether you are filing as single, married, head of household, or married filing separate. If you are under age 65, are single, and have Social Security income below $12,200, you generally don’t have to file a federal tax return. If you are older than 65, the amount goes up to $13,850 before you must file a federal tax return.  Hopefully, this answer is what you need to know about filing taxes with just Social Security income.  "} 
{"prompt":"When Should I Start Investing?","completion":" You may have heard the Chinese proverb: the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now. The same is true with investing. If you think you’ll have time to get started later, you should see  how that’s working out for older generations .  The Power of Compound Interest  If you wait to invest, you miss out on a huge advantage – compound interest. An urban legend says that Einstein once called this the most powerful force in the universe.  Compound interest means the money you invest earns interest, and your interest earns more interest. This allows the growth of your money to accelerate with time. If you start early, you will give your invested dollars a better opportunity to build on each other. The following example shows the true power of this:  Amber saves and invests $5,000 a year between the ages of 25 and 35, and then she stops saving. Jeff does not start saving until age 35. He then saves and invests $5,000 a year for the next 30 years.  Amber has saved a total of $50,000 (10 times $5,000) and Jeff has saved a total of $150,000 (30 times $5,000). They both earn an average of 10% a year on their investments ( average historical return of stock market ).  Who do you think has more money at age 65?  Amazingly it is Amber! She has a little under $1.4 million. Jeff ends up with $822,000, 41% less than Amber, even though he saved three times more of his money. This is because he started 10 years later. This is why it makes sense to start investing sooner rather than later. You can play with the numbers yourself using a  compound return calculator .  Should I Pay Off My Debt First?  This question comes up often. I usually recommend setting aside some income to invest while paying off debt. Even if the interest rate on your debt is higher than the expected return on your investments, it is psychologically important to see your wealth grow as your debt goes down. Otherwise, it can be tough to stick to your debt reduction plan. For instance, you can set aside 10% of your income for debt repayment and 10% for investing. Once your debt is paid off, you can double your investment contributions. No amount is too small – even  $50 per month  can go a long way.   Check out more articles on  paying off debt .

{"prompt":"What is a Sinking Fund?","completion":" A sinking fund is a way for corporations to put aside money at specific intervals in order to pay a bond or a debt that will be due at a later date.  You can use this same strategy to achieve your goals or pay for expenses that aren’t due on a monthly basis. By planning and putting away a little bit each paycheck, big expenses can be less of a burden.    Let’s say you pay your car insurance every six months, and that bill is $600 each time. Based on when the bill is due, you can figure out how long you have to save the full amount. For our example, let’s say you have six months.    To calculate how much to save, take the total due and divide it by the number of months you have. In our example it’s $600 divided by 6 which equals $100 per month. You would put your “sinking fund” requirement right on your monthly budget for $100. Or if you’re paid twice a month, you can even break it down further to $50 per paycheck.  I suggest moving the money for your sinking fund out of your checking account and into a savings account. Out of sight and out of mind! This can prevent you from spending the money on other things. Then, when the bill arrives, simply transfer the money back into your checking account and pay the bill.  The next month, start adding back to the sinking fund for the next time your insurance is due. "} 
{"prompt":"How To Talk about Finances with Your Children","completion":" It’s important to talk openly with your family about your financial goals, values, and situation on a regular basis. However, that’s easier said than done. As early as preschool, you can start talking to children about money and building their financial skills in age-appropriate ways. For preschoolers, you might focus on the skill of waiting (delayed gratification) or counting. For high schoolers, you might discuss healthy habits and help them open a bank account.  When you work together as a family to set financial priorities and follow a plan, you’re more likely to stick to it. Collaborative planning helps everyone make day-to-day financial choices that are in line with your goals, values, and financial reality.  If you don’t already talk about your finances as a family, there is no time like the present to start. Whether money is tight or not, here are some tips to consider:  Start with Goals, Values, and Essentials.  To help you make financial decisions, what is vital to the family? What does your family need to survive and thrive? Gather your family and talk about what is important to you collectively. Try to agree on the top priorities that you all intend to focus on together.   Establish a Schedule to Talk about Your Finances as a Family.  Think about how often you want and are able to check in. Weekly, monthly, or some other interval? Use these meetings to check in on how things are going and troubleshoot any issues.  When Changes Arise, Meet as Soon as Possible.  Such changes could include an economic recession, job loss, or a health situation. Be proactive and transparent about what this means for your financial situation to help your family manage their expectations.  Practice Clear Communication.  Practice communicating your financial concerns ahead of time. That way, you can deliver them calmly and clearly. This will increase the chances that your family will hear them and respond in ways that address the concern. Talking about financial challenges can be emotional and create conflict.  It’s no guarantee, but practice will help you deliver your message in ways that bring people in to resolve the situation.  Work Together to Make Tough Decisions.  When money is tight, it can be hard to balance the essentials and what everyone wants. If you’re struggling to make ends meet or want to build up your emergency fund to weather a recession, your family decisions become about trade-offs in priorities and trying to spend less than what you are bringing in.

{"prompt":"Keep It in the Family: How to Pass on Money and Assets to Family Members","completion":" Creating a plan for how you will pass on money or other assets (anything you own) is called  estate planning . Many people think that if they don’t have a lot of money or assets (like homes, cars, and jewelry), they don’t have an “estate.” But the fact is we all have an estate.  How you transfer your estate to the next generation is often referred to as a financial legacy. This legacy is the foundation for building inter-generational wealth.   The Emotional Side of Estate Planning  Transferring wealth is practical, but it is also an emotional process.  You have to consider something that most people don’t like to think about – what will happen to your family or heirs when you are no longer here. It can be sad to think about that reality, but the real question at stake is how we prepare ourselves and our families to continue to build on the financial wealth you have created.  Kathleen Burns Kingsbury, a wealth expert, suggests  the following questions  to ask yourself as you are preparing your estate:  What lessons did you learn from your parents about money and finance that you would like to pass onto your heirs? What family values would you like to pass down to the next generation and how do you plan on communicating this family legacy? What concerns do you have about your adult children when it comes to inheriting and managing the family wealth?  Simple Will or Trust?  There’s no right answer for everyone for whether a simple will or trust is better. It all depends on your circumstances. I recommend that you start by  learning about your options . (Note that this site sells products and services. I am not recommending that you buy anything there; it’s just a good place to compare your options.)  Once you decide what you need, consider the most appropriate way to get the service, including pro bono financial planners, nonprofit agencies, or paid financial or legal experts (usually an attorney for estate planning).  Beneficiary Designations  You should designate someone as your beneficiary for all of your accounts, including your employer retirement accounts as well as your checking and savings accounts. Make sure you keep these designations up to date if you have life changes (like if you move, marry, divorce, or have children). Do you  really  want your ex to get all of your stuff?  On a bank account, this is sometimes called a TOD (transfer on death) instead of beneficiary designation. It means that your beneficiary will be able to access the account without the intervention of a court or  probate .  If you have children under the age of 18, you should have at minimum a simple will with guardianship arrangements (need to do this? Go ahead…I’ll wait). The guardian may be the person you designate for the accounts if you are leaving funds for them to care for your dependents.  If you have insurance policies, keep good, updated records about the policies, the beneficiary, and the claim forms.  Record-Keeping  Keep all your records in one place and make a list (written and digital) of all of the above. Let your beneficiary know where that document is so that it’s easy to find.  What to Do Now  I know this all might sound like a lot to do. Well, it is! Estate planning is a big, important topic and I encourage you to learn more before making decisions.   But there are a few things that I encourage you to do as soon as possible:  Guardianship : If you have minor children, make sure you’ve arranged guardianship for them. Decide now who you want to care for your dependents and talk to them. Get a document establishing this in place even if you still need to work on other issues. Records : List your accounts! Know and list every bank, investment, retirement, employer retirement, and insurance account.  Don’t let perfection get in the way of progress. Gather all your documents and communicate your wishes to the person who will be in charge of executing your plan.  This is a great time to think about what is most important to you. Then take steps to make sure that everything you have worked hard for will be passed along according to your wishes! "} 
{"prompt":"I just paid off a house that I got on land contract. How do I add it to my credit report?","completion":" Submitted by Renee K.  This is a great question. Before your question, no one has ever asked me about this, so thank you for letting me get this info out!  What’s a land contract?  A land contract is an agreement between a buyer and seller. The buyer purchases property directly from the seller without the involvement of a bank.  Benefits of a land contract  For some people, a land contract is a great option for purchasing a home if they can’t get a traditional mortgage. It can let you buy a home while showing on your credit report that you don’t have as much debt in comparison to your income. This is called debt-to-income ratio.  Drawbacks of a land contract  On the flip side is the reality that the payments you make go directly to the seller instead of a bank. This means your payments may not be reported to the credit bureaus. You may miss out on the benefit of building an on-time payment history with the payments you make. You might think that as long as you have a record of your payments and the seller agrees with you, then you can report this payment history to the credit bureaus yourself. Unfortunately, that’s not the case.  Getting your payments reported to the credit bureaus  You are not able to report the payments to the credit bureaus. Only the creditors can report. That means you’re at the mercy of the seller in this situation. You can ask the seller to report your payment history to the credit reporting agencies. That would allow the payments to be added to your credit report.   But, more often than not, individuals who act as creditors in a land contract arrangement do not report payment history because they have to pay a fee to register with the reporting agencies and report payments. Consider negotiating with the seller. It may be to your benefit to offer to pay the fee if they are unwilling to do so.  Even if your credit report doesn’t show the payments, be proud of yourself for taking on the challenge of paying for your home and making all the payments so that you own it outright. That feeling of freedom can’t come from your credit report. "} 
{"prompt":"What can I do if there are loans on my credit report that aren’t mine?","completion":" Your credit history is an  important factor  for obtaining a loan, renting an apartment, and sometimes getting a job. However, it’s not uncommon for a credit report to contain mistakes. For example, your credit report may show an unpaid medical bill for services that were paid by the insurance company. It may show a student loan with monthly payments even if you paid off that loan last year. Your credit report might have an account on there that is not even yours.  These are mistakes that you can correct. In fact, you have the right to get mistakes corrected at no charge. Left uncorrected, mistakes could hurt your chances of reaching other financial goals. So, what do you do?  Order your credit reports  Your first step is to order and review your credit report from all three of the major credit reporting agencies (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to see which of your credit reports has mistakes. Because they are three separate companies, each credit reporting agency can have slightly different information. You can order free copies of your credit report from all three agencies at Annual Credit Report  online  or by calling 1-877-322-8228. You also can order copies directly from the three agencies. Under Federal law, you are entitled to receive one free copy of your credit report from each credit reporting agency every 12 months.  Follow instructions provided  If you discover an error on your credit report, follow the instructions provided with your credit report on how to correct errors. You can report errors to any of the credit reporting agencies by:  calling the credit agency using the dispute portal when you get your credit report sending a written letter, including documentation, to the appropriate agency  Provide documentation  Send any additional information that is needed to correct the error. The credit reporting agency will tell you what you need to send. Get in the habit of keeping your financial records in order so it’s easy to show where a mistake has occurred.  In the medical example above, call the medical provider to confirm that the insurance company paid the bill. Ask the hospital to send a letter of explanation to the credit reporting agency. To correct the student loan problem, send the credit reporting agency a copy of the document proving the loan was paid with a letter asking for a change in your record.  If an account is not yours, first contact the creditor listed on the credit report. Request more information about the account to help you determine whether the account belongs to you, is the result of identity theft, or was simply reported in error. You can dispute the information if you determine the account does not belong to you.  If you think it’s fraudulent, include in your explanation that you believe the account may be related to identity theft. You can dispute the account as fraud and ask the credit agency to add a security alert to your credit report. That alert will notify creditors that your information may have been compromised.  Explain the issue  Explain the problem in a brief letter. The agency must investigate your complaint within 30-45 days and get back to you with its results. As part of the investigation, the credit reporting agency will check with the creditor whose information you are questioning. If the agency finds that the information in the credit report is incorrect, the creditor must notify the other major credit reporting agencies of the error so they can update their information.   Contact a credit if unresolved  Contact the creditor directly if the credit reporting agency disputes the error and you still believe your credit report is inaccurate. When you resolve the dispute, ask the creditor to send a correction to the credit reporting agency.   If still unresolved, tell your side of the story  Write a consumer statement of your side of the story if the issue remains unresolved.  You may write up to 100 words to explain the situation. Employees of the credit reporting agency are often available to help you write your statement. Your statement will appear on your credit report moving forward.

{"prompt":"Is 58 too late to try to buy a home?","completion":" Submitted by Darlene D.  For many people, homeownership is an essential part of achieving the American Dream. I applaud you for pursuing your home ownership goals.   In my professional opinion, it’s never too late to buy a home as long as you can afford the mortgage. With modern health advances, people live much longer. So even at the age of 58, having a 15 or sometimes 30 year mortgage is not out of the question for many people. Also, owning a home has many advantages that add value to your financial and personal life.  By owning a home you build equity through appreciation, meaning your house may increase in value over time. At the same, homeowners get important tax breaks. The U.S. Tax Code lets you deduct the interest you pay on your mortgage, your property taxes, as well as some of the costs involved in buying your home. In addition, building equity in your home is a ready-made savings plan. And when you sell, you can generally take up to $250,00 ($500,000 for a married couple) as gain without owing any federal income tax.   On a personal level, owning a home is a great source of pride for many people. It’s tangible proof that you too can own a slice of the American Dream. If you are serious about buying a home, you may want to find a HUD-approved housing counseling agency to assist you with homeownership education and financing information. Happy house hunting! "} 
{"prompt":"How can I get a loan for a cheap used car?","completion":"Hello, Saundra! How do I go about finding and choosing a certain type of loan (if one exists) that would enable me to quickly buy a cheap used car (around a couple thousand) that I could be able to pay back (with no job/income) with only the money I have saved from last semester’s student loan refund and the following ones I’ll be receiving each semester for next few years? I’ve tried searching for too long now to find a vehicle for $1,000 or under, but I’ve been unsuccessful. It’s too difficult and I think it will be easier with a couple more thousand. Thank you in advance!  Submitted by Joan H.  First, congrats on saving that student loan refund! You are absolutely right that you will have more choices for a reliable car if you have additional cash. The question is, what price (the cost of money) will you pay for that cash?  My favorite choice for loans is the local credit union. When I was a (very broke) student I opened a savings account at a local credit union. For more than 10 years, I only had $10 in that account. They never cancelled the account even though I wasn’t a profitable (fee paying) customer. Fast forward 20 years, they now hold my mortgage and they are my first choice for all loans.  So, where do you begin? If you don’t have a banking relationship, consider opening an account with a credit union in your community. There are also online options, so you have many options. The interest rate on car loans is based on your credit score so check your credit reports before you apply so you know what to expect. If you need help with this step, contact a  reputable credit counseling agency .  You may have noticed that I did  not  recommend one of those auto dealers that offers credit at their store. That is a “buyer beware” situation as the cost of credit (fees and interest) is usually very high. They often bait you with a low payment to distract from the high interest rate and total cost of the car.  Bottom line: A credit union or bank will be your best option for an auto loan. Try to secure funding before you shop to help you stay within your budget. Check out this  credit union website  for info on how to prepare for a purchase. Good luck and drive safely!

{"prompt":"How much should I save if I’m in debt?","completion":" How much should I save monthly if I am in debt? Or what percentage of my income should I save if I am in debt?  Submitted by LaTisha V.  When we have debt, our priorities can change completely.  To start, we have to remember that not paying our debt will negatively impact our credit history and therefore take away other opportunities in the future.  In your situation, your income not only needs to cover your basic needs, but also your monthly debt payments. This means your savings capability will be reduced. However, this does  not  mean that it totally disappears. Saving is (almost always) possible.  Let’s start with the fact that there is no such thing as an ideal distribution of our income. Our needs are subjective and therefore we cannot answer this question with a mathematical formula. We all earn different amounts, we have different consumption habits, and our preferences change all the time. Even though experts recommend that we should aim to save 10% of our monthly income, you need to adapt this rule to your lifestyle. If you can do more, that’s great! On the other hand, if you can only save a few dollars a month, that is also great!  Anything you can save is better than nothing.  You can always start with something small and grow from there. Saving is more about consistency than quantity. Get in the habit and the numbers will follow. And if you have debt and your savings capability is diminished, it’s good to remember that the money you use to pay your debt can eventually be reallocated to savings once your debt is repaid.  So, how do you see your panorama now? Are your savings goals realistic? Or do you have to change them? How much can you start saving today?  Everyone must find their own financial balance. "} 
{"prompt":"Do I Qualify for Teacher Loan Forgiveness?","completion":" If you are a teacher or work for an educational service and also have federal student loans, you may qualify for Teacher Loan Forgiveness.  Requirements for Teacher Loan Forgiveness Eligibility  To qualify for Teacher Loan Forgiveness, you must have direct loans or FFEL Program loans borrowed after Oct. 1, 1998. You also need to be employed full-time for five complete and consecutive years as a highly qualified teacher. Additionally, the school where you teach must be an elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency. It must serve low-income students. See a  full directory of schools and agencies  that qualify under this program.  What is a Highly Qualified Teacher?  You must be a highly qualified teacher to be eligible for Teacher Loan Forgiveness. Highly qualified teachers have a bachelor’s degree and are fully certified to teach in their state. If you received a temporary, emergency, or provisional license, the time that you teach with that license does not qualify.  How Much Loan Forgiveness Do I Qualify For?  You can qualify for different amounts of loan forgiveness depending on what subjects you teach. All teachers can receive up to $5,000 in forgiveness. But you can qualify for up to $17,500 if you teach math or science at the secondary level or if you teach special education at the elementary or secondary level.  How to Apply for Teacher Loan Forgiveness  After five consecutive years of teaching, fill out the  Teacher Loan Forgiveness Application  and submit it to your loan servicer. If you have multiple federal loan servicers, submit a form to each of them.  You can qualify for both Teacher Loan Forgiveness and  Public Service Loan Forgiveness , just not during the same time period. This means that after you complete five consecutive years of teaching for Teacher Loan Forgiveness, you would complete an additional ten years (120 payments) for Public Service Loan Forgiveness "} 
{"prompt":"How to Find the Right Products for You","completion":" Hi, I’m Saundra Davis, financial coach here at SaverLife. Today we’re going to talk about how to find the right financial products and services for your situation.  It is wonderful that we have so many financial products and services to choose from, but it can also be overwhelming. It can be very difficult to make a decision. There are many things that you can choose.  Evaluate Your Needs  The first step you want to consider is: what do you need? What problem are you trying to solve? Or what goal are you trying to reach? Once you know that, you can start to determine what’s going to work best for you.  If someone recommends something and you try it and it doesn’t quite get you what you want, it’s fine to stop it and try something new.  Find a Trusted Source  Keep these things in mind: For financial services, you want to make sure that you’re using a trusted advisor. We call that a fiduciary. A fiduciary puts your interests ahead of their own.  We are all going to have to use financial products to achieve our financial plan. You just want to make sure that any recommendations you get are what’s right for you, and not based on what is the best commission structure for the person who’s selling the product.  Using Financial Apps  When it comes to financial apps, you want to make sure that the app can help you achieve your goal at a cost that you’re willing to pay.  Many apps are free, and that’s fine. Just pay attention to if that changes. There are many apps that start out free, and then begin to charge a fee. You may be willing to pay the fee. It may be worth it. The key here is just know what you’re buying.  If you’re trying an app and it’s not working out for you, go ahead and try something else. Don’t feel bad about it. Remember that “no judgment zone.” But just make sure everything you use is moving you in the direction of what you want to achieve.  Fortunately, there are a lot of apps that can help you set up a budget to keep your saving plan as part of your priority.  So, what are you saving for? "} 
{"prompt":"What is a Marketplace Plan?","completion":" Have you ever wondered what the difference is between a Marketplace plan and Obamacare? Good news: They’re one and the same.   The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, is the landmark healthcare reform legislation. It became the law of the land in the U.S. after President Barack Obama signed it in March 2010. The ACA primarily ensures that more people have access to more affordable and more comprehensive health insurance. It does this in a number of ways.  One of the biggest ways that the healthcare law expanded health insurance coverage to more people was by creating a way for people to shop for their own, high-quality health plans through something known as the  Health Insurance Marketplace . The law also guaranteed that people could get most forms of preventive care at no cost, and that people could get the coverage they needed regardless of pre-existing conditions. Plans purchased by individuals for themselves and their families from the Health Insurance Marketplace are known as Marketplace plans. Some people also refer to these kinds of plans as Obamacare.

{"prompt":"What’s your money style?","completion":" Hi, I’m Saundra Davis, SaverLife’s financial coach. Today we’re going to talk a little bit about our money personalities or our money style.  Are you a spender, saver, or planner?  Our approach to saving or spending really is rooted in the foundation of how we live with our money in our individual personality. Some of us are savers. Some of us are spenders. Some are planners and like to know where every dollar and every dime is going.  The main thing that you want to know is: Is your style working for you? Is your style getting you what you want?  Is your money style getting in the way?  If your money style or your money personality is getting in the way of your financial health and wellbeing, there are a couple of things that you can do.   Track your financial behaviors for a week or even a month to identify if what you’re doing is getting you what you want.  If you find that there’s some changes that you would like to make, the first thing you can do is gather information about the thing that you want to change.  Say for instance you’re finding that you have overdrafts and you want to do something differently. Make sure that you know when it happens, where it happens, so that you can identify the cause and then you can identify the solution.

{"prompt":"How Much Should I Save Monthly if I’m in Debt?","completion":" Saving money is always a priority, but the amount you save depends on your other goals, such as paying off debt. A rule of thumb is to save at least $1,000 to cover emergency expenses. Consider labeling your emergency account, “Debt-Proof Insurance.” The title is a reminder that the account exists to keep you out of debt. Without cash to pay for emergency expenses, you may find yourself in a never-ending cycle of paying off debt, having an unexpected expense, and having to use credit to pay for the cost. When your account drops below $1,000, stop extra payments towards debt and get your account back up to $1,000. Once it’s at $1,000, use the extra money to continue your debt payoff strategy.  In addition to saving for emergency expenses, save for the expenses you know will happen during the year. This includes scheduled car and home maintenance. These expenses should be a category in your budget.  Once you pay off your debt, celebrate and treat yourself (within reason). Then save at least three months of your monthly living expenses. Ideally, you want to save at least 10% of your income monthly. Prioritize savings like it’s a bill so you won’t have to pay a credit card bill instead. "} 
{"prompt":"What is a financial health score?","completion":"Congrats on taking this step in your SaverLife journey! Your score is on a scale of 1 to 100.

It’s hard to devote time and resources to planning for the future because the present is unstable.  40-79 : You might have some savings, but perhaps you also have a lot of debt. You’ve started to plan for the future, but not as much as you’d like to.  80-100 : You are financially stable and actively working towards your long-term financial goals.   The overall score breaks down into 4 subsection scores: Spend, Borrow, Save, and Plan. These four areas are crucial to setting yourself up for financial security.  Why should I care about it?  The score is designed to be a tool for you. Your score is a kind of “pulse check” for you to see which areas of your finances could benefit from some extra attention.  Now that you know your score, you can take action! Maybe there’s something you can change today, like setting up automatic savings or making a budget.

{"prompt":"The myRA program is being shut down. What should I do?","completion":"“I enrolled and contributed to myRA (Roth IRA) since August 2016. The myRA.gov program is now being shut down. What should I do with my only Roth IRA/ Retirement investment?”  Submitted by Brian H.  Admittedly, my heart was broken when the announcement about shutting down myRA® hit the news. It wasn’t perfect, but it was a way to help people do the very thing financial professionals want people to do more: save for retirement.  Do you want to continue saving in a Roth account?  You contribute to a Roth with after-tax dollars (money on which you have already paid income taxes). This means that the tax advantage of the Roth account is particularly helpful if you need the tax break more in your senior years than you do now.  So, first you must decide if a Roth is still the best fit for your needs. There are so many opinions online (I have mine as well), but in order to make this decision,  look at the facts  before you choose. There is no universal right choice – only the best choice for your circumstances.  If you do want to stick with a Roth, you have options!  1. Do nothing  Your account will be moved automatically.  According to the US Treasury website , “All open myRA® accounts will be closed and balances moved to new Roth IRAs at Retirement Clearinghouse, LLC (RCH) if no action is taken.”  2. Transfer to another Roth account  If you have investment accounts in another institution, you can do a “trustee – to – trustee” direct transfer and avoid any fees or penalties. Contact the new institution and they will walk you through the process.  The unknown variable here is the fees, so be cautious and ask questions before making any moves. If you move to an new institution, look for providers that have low fees and low minimums to open an account.  3. Withdraw the funds  This may seem like the easy solution, especially if you have looming debt. However, you can lose the benefit of the interest you have gained. While you won’t be penalized for taking out what you put in, you may have penalties if you withdraw the interest you have earned.  If you are not yet 59½ and need the funds, you can withdraw your contribution, but there will be fees: a whopping 10% early withdrawal penalty. You may be able to avoid the fees if you use the money for certain financial goals or situations, such as purchasing your first home, paying college costs, medical bills, or purchasing health insurance after losing your job.  Watch the Clock  The myRA deadlines may provide some insight. If you want to transfer to another Roth, do your research and learn a bit about investing before you take action. Check out these deadlines and consider the timing.   Beware of Fees  Whatever you decide, be wary of anyone trying to sell you something. You should not need to incur fees for this transfer. If you aren’t sure about what to do, allowing the US Treasury to place your money in a low-risk account with no management fee may be your best option.  To talk with someone (an actual human) before making this decision, find a  financial coach or counselor  who can help you consider your options with you specific circumstances in mind. "} 
{"prompt":"How should I pay off medical debt that’s been sent to a collection agency?","completion":"“My debt from an unpaid urgent care bill has been sent to a collection agency. What is the best way to go about paying off this debt?”  Submitted by Jessica J.  Medical debt is a huge financial stressors for many people. Taking action early is the best way to get it under control.  Double-check your debt  Before you agree to anything, make sure the debt is yours and is accurate. If it has been sent to collections, there are likely additional fees. Dig a bit deeper to clarify the actual amount of the outstanding debt and the fees associated with collections. This information will be helpful if you have to negotiate.  Negotiate and plan  Once you have confirmed the debt is yours, negotiate. Let them know how much you can afford to pay. Don’t feel pressured to accept their first request. Having an accurate budget that includes debt repayment can help you avoid promising more than you can pay. When you call to negotiate, have a clear solution that works for you (i.e. I can pay $XX each month for XX months) and be sure you choose a due date that will not cause unnecessary pressure on your monthly cash flow.  Get it in writing  Get the agreement in writing! This is crucial. If the debt is in collections, it is impacting your credit score. Request (and require) a written agreement that when the debt is paid they will remove the delinquency from your credit report or change the status to paid in full.  The CFPB (Consumer Finance Protection Bureau) has  sample letters and action steps  to help you through this process. If you need additional help, contact a local nonprofit credit counseling agency.  Keep saving!  As always, I encourage you to keep your saving plan (even if the amount is small) on track as you pay down the debt. "}

{"prompt":"What is the Earned Income Tax Credit?","completion":" The  Earned Income Tax Credit  (EITC or EIC) is a benefit for working people with low to moderate income. To qualify, you must meet certain requirements. You must also file a tax return even if you don’t owe any taxes or are not required to file. The EITC reduces the taxes you owe and may even give you a refund.  EITC Requirements  There are certain requirements you must meet in order to be eligible for the EITC. You must have earned income, whether it’s from working for someone or running your own business. You must also meet some additional requirements.  If you are claiming a child, your child must meet all the qualifying child rules for you (or your spouse if you file a joint return).  If you do not claim a child that qualifies you for the credit, you must meet these rules:  You must have resided in the US for more than 6 months No one else can claim you as a dependent on their tax return You must be between the ages of 25 and 65 at the end of the tax year  Income Limits for the EITC  There are limits on how much you can earn before you no longer qualify for the EITC. The number of children you are claiming will determine these limits.  For joint filers, the limit ranges from $21,370 (for couples who claim no children) to $55,952 (for couples with three or more children).   The credit can provide as much as $6,557 for 2019. If the credit is more than what you owe, it doesn’t just bring your tax bill to zero. It means you get the difference as a refund. For example, if according to the standard tax rate your tax due was $550, but your Earned Income Credit was $1,550, you would get a refund of $1000.  If you aren’t sure if you qualify for EITC, the IRS has a  publication to guide you through the process . "} 
{"prompt":"How Do You Establish Credit?","completion":"    Sign up for SaverLife  to earn points and chances to win cash prizes when you read articles like this!  Establishing credit is important. Using credit over time creates a credit history (hopefully of on-time payments) that businesses use to decide if they will give you credit. Without a credit history, companies may be hesitant to give you credit because they are unsure if you will pay them back.  This may mean paying a higherinterest rate, having to pay a security deposit or even being denied loans forhomes or cars.  The following are five ways you can establish credit.  Get a credit card  BE CAREFUL! Most people tend to  spend more with credit cards . Credit cards can give you a false sense that you have more moneyto spend than you actually have.   If you get a credit card toestablish credit, consider the following suggestions:  Set-upautomatic payments, so you don’t get a ding on your credit report for aforgotten late payment. Only use yourcredit card to pay small bills with predictable monthly payments, like acellphone or cable bill. Pay the credit card balance off monthly. Do not spendmore than 30% of your credit limit. How much of your overall credit limit youuse can affect your overall credit score.   Get a secured credit card  If youdo not qualify for a traditional credit card (unsecured credit card), you can geta secured credit card instead.  A securedcredit card requires a deposit. That deposit is typically your credit cardlimit. Similar to an unsecured card, the rule of thumb is to only use 30% ofyour credit limit. Ask your creditor if they will report your payments to thecredit bureaus. Not all secure credit card companies report to credit bureaus.   Pay your student loans consistently  Your student loan servicer reportsyour loan information to credit bureaus. If you  cannot afford your payments , loan providers, particularly  federal loan providers , offer several options to help make your payment more affordable.  Auto installment loan  Use the 20/4/10 as a rule of thumbso you don’t get a car you can’t afford.  Make a 20%down payment Finance thecar for no more than four years Thetotal cost of a car  shouldn’texceed 10% of your income (car loan payment, insurance, fuel, warranties, and averagemonthly maintenance costs) If you cannotkeep your costs to 10% of your monthly income, commit to choosing a vehicle asclose to 10% of your monthly income as possible  Become an authorized user on someone else’s credit card  Ask yourparents (assuming they have good credit) to make you an authorized user ontheir credit card. An authorized user can use another person’s credit card intheir name. The primary account holder adds the authorized user to their creditcard account.   An authorizer user benefits fromhaving the primary account holder’s credit payment history reported on theauthorized user’s credit report. As the primary account holder makes on-timepayments, it may help you establish a good credit history.  A word of caution :  If the primary account holder does not pay their bills, the late payments will be reported on your credit report. In most cases, you will not be responsible for the credit card bill.  The bottom line  Establishing credit means using good credit habits, like paying your bills on time, over time to have a good credit score. As you work to establish credit, remember to use credit wisely so your hard work will help and not hurt your credit in the future.

{"prompt":"Starting, Funding, and Growing Your Small Business","completion":"Many people hope someday to work for themselves and build a business from the ground up. If that sounds like you, regardless of what stage you are in the process, focus on your finances to increase your chances of success. Check out the tips below for a good place to get started.  Planning Your Small Business  If you’re thinking about starting a small business, you may still be considering the big questions, such as “Should I start with a side hustle before going all-in?” “What will my business do?” and “How can I do what I love  and  make money?”  This is the stage where you should be doing tons of research, because the decisions you make now will guide everything that comes next.  Here are a few key questions:   What is your vision?  In other words, what are your hopes and dreams? What are you building?  What is your mission?  Your mission lays out how you will achieve your vision, including details like your target market and your unique offerings.  How will you price your product?  This strategy may change over time, but you need an initial price model that allows you to be profitable (make more money than your business spends) over time.  How will you get the word out?  Do you have a plan in place for advertising your business?   Entrepreneur Magazine offers a  12-step guide  to these issues that will help you get started, and once you’re ready to take a stab at a business plan, check out this  business plan template .  If you want to talk to an expert at this stage, try connecting with  your local U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) office .  Funding Your Small Business  Unless you’re able to completely self-finance your small business, chances are you’ll need some outside funding. You’ll have to convince people that your business is a good investment, so make sure you have a solid business plan and confident answers to the questions above. You’ll also need to explain exactly what you plan to do with any funds that you raise.  Funding your business can take many different forms, including:   Self-funding  using your savings or even a 401k (using retirement funds has  serious  implications, so before taking this step talk to a trusted financial professional)  Small business grants  Traditional loans  from a financial institution like a bank or credit union (you need to pay back this money with interest)  Venture capital  from investors (investors give you money in exchange for partial ownership in the company)  Crowdfunding  from friends, family, or other people who hear about your business   For more information about your funding options,  check out this guide from SBA .  Growing Your Small Business  If you’ve already got the basics figured out and are looking to expand your small business, this is a perfect time to reflect on your goals and how things are going in order to maximize the efforts you undertook to get your small business off the ground. Ask yourself:   What are you doing well?  What are you missing?  Is there room for growth? More demand, new product?  If money is tight, how will you manage your growth to ensure you don’t increase your costs before you’re sure you’ll increase your sales?   Throughout this process, make sure you’re  staying on the right side of Uncle Sam  and covering your liability by keeping good records and doing your research. "}

{"prompt":"Should I Add My Child as an Authorized User on My Credit Card?","completion":" As a parent, you want to do everything you can to set your child up for success. And lately, the importance of helping them understand personal finance has become clear. While you work with them on saving and living within their means, you may also want to talk to them about credit.       You may even want to help them start  establishing good credit , which is a  cornerstone for financial independence . One way that you can help your child establish credit is by adding them as an authorized user to one of your credit cards. But before you add your child as an authorized user, it is important to understand what it means and how it will affect their credit and yours.  What Is an Authorized User on a Credit Card?  When you make someone an authorized user on your credit card, you are giving them the ability to charge things to your account. They will get their own card in their name. But all of the charges they make will be applied to your account, and you will be responsible for paying them. It is important to understand that any charges your child makes on the card will ultimately be your responsibility.  Benefits of Making Your Child an Authorized User on Your Credit Card  Adding your child as an authorized user to your credit card can help them in several ways. First, it can help them establish a credit history.  Because the card is in their name, they will start building a credit file. This helps them because it lengthens their credit history, which makes up 15% of their FICO credit score. The age at which you can make your child an authorized user varies by card. But it will be difficult for your child to get a credit card on their own until they are 21 (some cards can be obtained at 18 but with stricter application requirements). Adding your child as an authorized user before they are 21 will give them a longer credit history.  Another benefit of adding your child to your credit card is that gives them a chance to learn more about credit. You can teach them firsthand about responsible credit usage, never charging more than you can pay off, and always paying on time. Teaching them these necessary lessons will help them maintain a better credit score throughout their life.  Drawbacks and Risks of Adding Your Child as an Authorized User on Your Credit Card  There are a few things to keep in mind when adding your child to your credit card as an authorized user. First, it is important to remember that every charge they make is ultimately your responsibility. Have conversations about credit limits and help them be aware of what they are spending. Some parents add their child as an authorized user with the understanding their child will only charge gas, transportation, emergencies, or other certain expenses.  If you are adding them to your card to help them build their credit score, make sure that the card reports authorized users to the credit bureaus. If they don’t, having your child as an authorized user won’t impact their credit score. Your card’s reporting policy should be included in their policy statement.  What your child does as an authorized user on the account will affect your credit score, and what you do will affect theirs. So, if you’re carrying a balance on the card due to either party’s spending, both credit scores could suffer as a result. This is because you will be using more of your available credit, causing your credit utilization ratio to be higher.  Final Thoughts on Authorized Users  Adding your child as an authorized user to your credit card is a good way to help them start to understand credit and build both credit and financial responsibility. But it is important to remember that all charges they make, whether you approved them or not, are ultimately your responsibility to pay off. If you decide to add them to your account, make sure that you also help them understand credit and learn to use it responsibly. Having a good credit score is helpful in the real world and adding your child as an authorized user can help them on their path.

{"prompt":"Big Changes with the Child Tax Credit – Including an Advance Payment","completion":" Stop! Don’t know where to start when it comes to claiming the Child Tax Credit?  Take our short quiz to find out .  The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 really helped many taxpayers with 2020 Federal income taxes. But there are also tax changes for the tax year 2021 that will impact many taxpayers. One of these changes is an expansion of the Child Tax Credit for those eligible for the credit in 2021. Here is the summary of the changes:  How the Child Tax Credit Is Changing  The credit is  fully refundable . This means that taxpayers who didn’t receive the full child tax credit in previous years due to their low or no tax liability may receive the full tax credit and higher tax refunds.  Even those who earned $0 income in 2021 may be eligible .     The credit will  include children who turn 17 in 2021 . In previous years, children who turned 17 during the tax year did not qualify the taxpayer for the child tax credit. This is the  only change  to who is a qualifying child for this tax credit.  The credit amount will increase for many taxpayers . The increased amount starts to phase out (be reduced) for incomes over $150,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return and qualifying widows or widowers, $112,500 for heads of household, and $75,000 for all other taxpayers.  The child tax credit is $3000 for ages 6 to 17 (up from $2000) and is $3600 (up from $2000) for under 6 .  Payments will start in July and go through December and will be based on the 2020 tax return filing (2019 if you haven’t filed 2020 in time for the IRS to start the payments).  It’s not too late to sign up. Many families with children are eligible for this crucial tax relief – including those who have not made enough money to be required to file taxes.  The IRS has a way for non-filers to receive the Child Tax Credit.  Another change that in particular may requires some tax planning for taxpayers is the monthly payment from July-December. If you don’t want to get the advance child tax credit payments or if you want to update the information that the IRS is basing the payments on, the IRS will be providing a method to opt-out or to make those changes.   An Example of How the Advance Child Tax Credit Works  Let’s say you have two qualifying children ages 7 and 8, and you qualify to get the full Child Tax Credit and the expanded amount. Your total Child Tax Credit would be $6,000. You will receive $3,000 over 6 months, so $500 a month from July through December. This can be very helpful for many people.  However, it may cause a problem. You’ll only get $3,000 of the Child Tax Credit when you file your tax return ($6,000 – $3,000= $3,000). In previous years, you may have received $4,000. If you are used to receiving a $4,000 Child Tax Credit with your tax return but receive a $3,000 tax credit, it may cause you a problem. If you typically get say an $8,000 refund but instead get $7000, maybe that isn’t so bad. But if you typically get a $500 refund and now owe $500, that may be a problem.  What to Watch Out for with the Advance Child Tax Credit  And there can be other complications. Let’s say you claimed a child with the Child Tax Credit for the tax year 2020, but are not claiming the child for the tax year 2021. If you do nothing, you’ll receive an advance tax credit that you won’t claim on your tax return. You could end up getting a significantly reduced refund or even owing a substantial amount of money. If you get an advance on the Child Tax Credit for a child you don’t claim on your 2021 tax return, the IRS will expect you to pay it back via your tax return.   Parents alternating which parent claims a child each year may be the most common circumstance in which a taxpayer may receive the advance child tax credit payments when they won’t be claiming the child. If you claimed a child for the tax year 2020 but the other parent will claim them for the tax year 2021, it would probably be wise to opt-out of the advance child tax credit payments when the IRS provides the method to opt-out.

{"prompt":"Help is out there! Resources for when the unexpected happens","completion":"Few words describe the human experience better than the quote by writer and cartoonist Allen Saunders:  “Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.”  We all know this is true, so what can you do when things don’t go according to plan? Sure, an emergency fund can give you a sense of security for some financial situations, but what about when something you couldn’t have planned for happens?  Let’s explore some resources you can turn to when trouble strikes.  Dealing with Job Loss  Losing a job can be a devastating blow to your emotional and financial well-being. If you’re facing unemployment, prepare a plan to  manage the financial implications  and  jumpstart your job search .  Dealing with Death in the Family  The death of a loved one can leave you feeling hopeless and unsure of where to turn. Focus your attention on  taking care of the things that require your immediate attention  while being sensitive to taking the time you need to grieve your loss.  Dealing with Legal Trouble  Legal issues can come in many forms, so there really is no “one size fits all” to address these concerns. The  National Consumer Law Center  is a trusted resource for legal issues, ranging from foreclosure prevention to bankruptcy. They also offer guidance on finding and accessing legal aid in your community.  We all face situations that can leave us feeling stuck or overwhelmed. The key to overcoming any challenge is to first take care of ourselves. There is a reason that we are reminded to “put our own mask on first” before trying to help others. We simply can’t be there for other people if we are floundering. I personally struggle with this, as I am the “go to” person in many situations.

{"prompt":"What Is a Pre-Paid College Tuition 529 Plan and Is It Right for Me?","completion":" For those of us who have children, just thinking about  putting them through four years of college  can feel overwhelming. In the United States, the cost of college tuition is higher than almost anywhere else in the world. And it keeps rising every year!  According to a survey from the College Board (the company that administers the SAT), the 2020 estimated annual cost was $10,560 for in-state tuition for a four-year public university and $37,650 for tuition at a private university. It costs approximately $284,570 (factoring in inflation) for two married parents with middle-class incomes to raise one child (born in 2015) to age 17, not including college costs. It’s understandable that you may find paying for college to be a challenge without assistance.  What Is a Pre-Paid College Tuition 529 Plan?  If you’re thinking about saving for college, you may have heard of a traditional 529 plan. A traditional  529 plan  is an investment savings plan in which you can save money to pay for your child’s college tuition. All 50 states and some private institutions offer 529 plans. The money that you save is invested so that you can grow your account balance faster than you would in a traditional savings account.  As an alternative, you can also save for college tuition in the Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan. The Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan is an option that public universities in nine participating states and some private universities offer. It allows you to “lock in” the cost of college tuition at today’s prices. Basically, you save in the same way that you would with a traditional 529 plan or a savings account. However, your total college tuition costs are frozen in advance. That means you don’t have to worry about whether your savings will be enough when it’s time to pay.  Benefits of a Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan  No Price Surprises . The price of tuition is written into the contract when you sign up for the plan. The price does not increase. Tax-Free Contributions . For 2021, you can contribute up to $15,000 annually per individual without triggering the gift tax. Tax-Free Withdrawals . Similar to the traditional 529 plan, the money you save will grow tax-free. You can withdraw it tax-free to pay for college tuition. Favorable Treatment for Federal Financial Aid . A 529 Pre-Paid Tuition Plan account owned by a parent is considered a parent asset. Only 5.64% of total parent financial assets are counted toward federal aid versus 20% of student-owned assets. No Restrictions for Other Colleges . If you decide not to apply to the college that is sponsoring the Pre-Paid Tuition, you can move the money in your account to any other school you choose.  Just be aware that what you have saved in your account is not guaranteed to cover the full cost of any other college.  Disadvantages of a Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan  Account Withdrawal Restrictions . Unlike the traditional 529 plan, you can only use tax-free withdrawals to pay for tuition costs. Withdrawals made to pay for other college expenses, like room and board or books, may be taxed. Residency Requirement . You must be a resident of the specific state where the public university that offers the Pre-Paid Tuition Plan is located. Pre-Paid Tuition Plans offered by private universities, on the other hand, are open to all US residents. Investment Earnings Restrictions . If you choose to attend a school other than the school that the Pre-Paid Tuition Plan is attached to, you may not be able to transfer all of the investment earnings you have in your account. Plan Open Enrollment . not all plans have open enrollment year-round. Some plans allow enrollment of new accounts only at specified times.  Before you sign up for a Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan, do your homework. Read the plan details carefully to be sure that you understand what it offers and what you’re committing to.  If you and your student know in advance that you will be applying to a specific school and want to avoid some of the sticker shock of the rising costs of college tuition, then a Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan may be the right tool for you.

{"prompt":"How do you know if life insurance is a good choice?","completion":"“How do you know which life insurance is good for you?”  Submitted by Migdalia C.  Life (and other) insurance policies are a way to protect your assets. If you think about your decision this way, you’ll have the information you need to make the best decision for you.  What are your needs?  Consider these questions:   Who is depending on you for income?  What resources do you want to leave for those you care about?  Are there any other needs for life insurance? For example: charitable donations and education for children.  How will the premiums fit into your budget now and over the term of the policy?   Evaluate your options  Once you understand your needs, you can  begin to investigate your options . By considering your needs before shopping, you’ll be better able to assess how much insurance you need and the cost you’re willing to spend.  This is a financial product, so work with facts rather than emotions. This will help you figure out if the person or company you are considering is offering the right product for your needs and budget.  Insurance policies charge fees and often pay commissions to the person selling them to you. Find a trusted resource and be prepared to ask questions to ensure the recommendation is best for you (not based on the highest commission).  Many fee-only financial planners (fiduciary standard means they don’t sell products) suggest buying term life insurance that suits your time horizon (often based on your expected employment term and/or the period of time that your dependents will rely on you for income). Term policies often last 20 or 30 years. Some believe this is “gambling” or throwing away money because a term policy has no cash value at the end of the term. The point of this type of policy is to insure against losses during the term. This means the costs will be lower than a “whole life” policy, which has an investment feature and often comes with a hefty premium.  Alternative life insurance options  If you need and can’t afford life insurance, check out  LifeBridge  by Mass Mutual. This program offers free policies for parents and guardians.  As is the case with every financial topic,  everything affects everything . Consider your entire financial picture when taking this step. "}

From skyrocketing utility bills to buying groceries, filing taxes may not be at the top of your mind. But this year, more than ever, it is important to file your taxes, especially if you were unemployed or you believe you haven’t received your full stimulus checks.

{"prompt":"Understanding Your Debt","completion":" Hi, I’m Saundra Davis, financial coach here at SaverLife. Today we are going to talk about one of the biggest financial stressors in many of our financial lives: debt.  The “No Judgment Zone”  So, the very first thing is remember the “no judgment zone.” Everything that you have done in your financial past that you’re not very proud of, this is the time to remember to be gentle with yourself, and debt is often one of those areas. It doesn’t matter what you’ve done before. What matters is what are you going to do today.  Know Your Debt  One of the things we can begin with is knowing exactly how much debt we have. Not only the total amount, but the individual debts: how much, when it’s due, and how much we’re paying in interest on each one of those debts.  Balance Debt and Savings  Some of you might be tempted to stop saving while you’re trying to pay off your debt. I would encourage you to build your debt reduction budget with saving in mind. In other words, do a little bit of both. You might have to reduce your savings, but I would encourage you not to give up on it completely.  Budget for Debt Reduction  So build your debt reduction plan by identifying who you owe, when the debt is due, and how much you can afford to pay. Make sure that your budget includes debt reduction as well as saving to make sure that you don’t lose the habit of saving that you’ve worked so hard to achieve. And when thinking about your financial goals overall, keep debt and saving in mind.  What are you saving for?  Learn more about debt reduction strategies. "}

We had no money, jobs, or children and we both lived at home with our parents.   After we got married and had children and jobs, we started building a life together. But we still didn’t really talk about our finances. Even when we purchased our first home together, because I paid the bills and we qualified for the loan on my credit history and income, there were no financial discussions. At the same time, we did not have a lot of debt, we had a good credit rating, and we definitely did not have any student loans. Fast forward 30 years and we still rarely talk about the subject, but our finances are in great shape.  Debt is extremely common  Over the last 10 years, many people have taken on lots of debt, especially student loans. Americans have several different types of debt. Between credit card debt, mortgages, auto loans and student loans,  the average debt per household is about $132,529 . As of 2020, 1 in 4 Americans have student loan debt. An estimated 44.7 million people now owe  more than $1.53 trillion  in student loan debt. The average student loan debt amount is $37,172, with monthly payments of $393.  Money and love  Considering these compelling statistics and other financial factors such as income inequality, I suggest that all people in a relationship discuss finances. This is especially important if your finances are intertwined with your partner in any way. Financial issues, if left unresolved, can ruin even the most successful marriages. When a couple’s finances are not in order, it leaves both of them feeling insecure and can eventually lead the relationship into turmoil. This principle applies to unmarried couples and people in serious relationships alike. So when the relationship gets serious, discuss things like debt, credit, credit scores, and mutual financial goals together.  When I first got married, my wife and I did not discuss finances. But today I believe it’s important to discuss love and money in your relationship. These conversations, even when they are difficult, can help build trust and healthy communications with your partner. Being transparent about your financial situation will help you find long-term financial stability together.  "} 
{"prompt":"Your Money: Your Values","completion":" Hi, I’m Saundra Davis, financial coach here at SaverLife. Today, we’re going to talk about your money values.  We often don’t think about how our values play in to what we do with our money. But the fact is everything you do with money makes perfect sense if you understand what you believe about money. Our deeply held beliefs, values, fears, and fantasies all come into play with every single financial choice that we make.  Money Mindfulness  Being present with your day-to-day financial choices – I call this  money mindfulness  – will help make sure that you’ve aligned your behavior with the things that matter most. It’s not necessarily about changing anything right away. I encourage you first to notice:   What are you doing now?  Is it getting you what you want?  If not, what do you want to do differently?   And then making sure that you get the information and the resources that you need to align your behaviors with your end goal in mind.  Observe Your Behaviors  Start today observing your financial behaviors. You can do this in a journal or an index card or anything else that you can just keep handy so that you can track your behaviors and how you feel about your behaviors as you go through your daily routines.  Think about these questions:   What does success mean to you? Get a really clear definition of what financial success means to you and what it’ll mean for you to achieve that success.  How will your family or the people that you care about be impacted if you were to achieve the success that you desire?  What are some of the things that you could do on a day-to-day basis to move you closer toward your definition of success?   Remember, this is not about judging yourself. This is about becoming more mindful and thoughtful in your day-to-day financial decisions and making sure that what you’re doing is getting you what you want.  What are you saving for? "} 
{"prompt":"What do I do once I have applied for Marketplace insurance?","completion":" After you’ve completed the Marketplace application, there are a number of things you may have to do next before your coverage kicks in. You can complete all of these steps through HealthCare.gov or your free HealthSherpa account.  Submitting required documentation  You may be asked to submit documents to prove your qualifying life event, your income, or citizenship. If so, you’ll have 30 days to submit these documents through your HealthSherpa consumer account, your HealthCare.gov account, or by mail. If you applied for coverage through a state exchange, you’ll submit these documents directly to the exchange using the instructions they provided.   Paying monthly premium  Your health insurance coverage won’t begin until you’ve paid your first premium. Your first payment is often paid directly through your HealthCare.gov or HealthSherpa account, but is sometimes paid directly to your insurance company. If you have any questions about where your first premium payment needs to be paid, a member of the HealthSherpa Consumer Advocate Team can help. They can be reached at (844) 984-0731. Or, you can contact your new insurer directly to find out how best to make your first payment. If you do not complete your first payment by it’s due date, your coverage will be cancelled.   After this first payment, you will continue to make your monthly premium payments directly to your insurance company. Please contact your insurance company should you need further instructions on how to make these payments, though most insurance companies accept payment through an online portal, via phone, or through a paper check in the mail.   Also, once you’ve paid your first premium, you’ll usually have a 90-day grace period on any future payments before your plan is cancelled.  Coverage start date  Depending on  when you enrolled , you may have different coverage start dates.  If you enrolled during the annual Open Enrollment Period, your coverage will begin on January 1st of the upcoming year.   During a Special Enrollment Period, if you applied for coverage before the 15th of the month, your coverage will usually begin on the first day of the next month. If you apply after the 15th, it will begin on the first day of the month after next.   In some Special Enrollment Period cases, such as having a baby or adopting a child, the coverage may be retroactive to the day of the birth or adoption.  Reporting major life changes  Don’t forget to report any changes to your life circumstances throughout the year. You should report a change if any of the following occur:  Someone in your tax household was offered other health insurance through an employer, even if they didn’t enroll You got married or divorced You had a baby or adopted a child Someone in your tax household became eligible for Medicaid/CHIP or Medicare Someone in your tax household lost eligibility for Medicaid/CHIP A child on your plan turned 26 You became pregnant Your income changed Your citizenship or immigration status changed A member of your tax household passed away Your tax filing status changed Someone in your tax household lost coverage they were offered by an employer Your disability status changed Your status as an American Indian / Alaska Native or tribal member changed  These changes to your household circumstances can affect how much subsidy you qualify for. When you report a life change, your monthly premiums are automatically updated to account for this. However, if you don’t report a change, you may have to pay money back or be owed money when you file your taxes.  You can report any of these life changes through your HealthCare.gov account. Or, if you’ve enrolled through a web broker like HealthSherpa, you can do this by logging in to your HealthSherpa account or calling the HealthSherpa Consumer Advocate team at (844) 984-0731.  Health insurance and your taxes  When it comes time to file your federal income tax return, you’ll receive Form 1095-A in the mail. Your Form 1095-A will also be available in your HealthCare.gov account or HealthSherpa account. You must use Form 1095-A to fill out your taxes if you received a subsidy. "} 
{"prompt":"How will filing for bankruptcy affect my retirement?","completion":"What is your perspective about filing for bankruptcy in regards to saving for retirement?  Submitted by Chris C.  When it comes to any financial decision, everything affects everything. Kudos for thinking about the impact of bankruptcy on retirement planning. The decision to file bankruptcy is a big one, as it will impact your financial life for several years. I recommend checking out  this resource by NOLO Press  (my go-to source when I’m thinking about legal stuff) and consider the following issues:   How far are you away from retirement? If you have 10+ years left, you have more flexibility to pay down your debt and continue saving.  Do you have the financial resources to continue paying your debt  and  stay on track for retirement savings?  If retirement is near, what will your income be? Will it cover your debt payments if you decide not to file for bankruptcy?   All financial decisions are personal and there may not be a “right” answer – but that doesn’t mean you should settle for anything less than the best answer  for your situation . I recommend that you check out the link above and then contact a credit counseling company (my fave is  Consumer Credit Counseling Service of San Francisco ). Talk about the options for debt repayment to make sure you consider all of the possibilities.  Retirement is an exciting time, and there are services and support to help you choose the best option for you. If you haven’t already, try this  retirement calculator  to see if you are on track.

{"prompt":"Women Run the (Financial) World","completion":" Financial Tips for Women  Beyoncé had it right. Girls run the world; she just left out the word “financial.”  With Women’s History Month coming to an end, I could think of nothing better than to create a piece for women by a woman. Why would I want to do this?  Women have been paving the way for future generations of women. More than ever before, women are the primary earners or sole earners for their households. Women make most of the spending decisions in their household. Personally, I think this fact alone puts women in a very powerful position. Financial security is the primary goal of money management for women. Although this is also true for men, women place a significantly higher emphasis on that goal.  If you’re wondering how I can take these few things and equate that to women running the financial world, think about it like this. Women are bringing in more income. They are in charge of deciding how to best use the money they or their partners are earning. The decision of whether to spend, save, or invest is falling into the hands of women. Money spent in their community is helping local businesses, and women tend to be more intentional in the businesses they support (woman- or black-owned businesses, for example). Women are doing all of this while keeping the focus on financial security for themselves and their families.  We have power. What can we do with it?  1. Set goals  Think about what financial security means to you. Clearly defining this will bring you clarity so you know exactly what you’re aiming for. The more you can break down this large goal into smaller chunks, the easier it will be to achieve. I think of it as a set of stairs. Nobody levitates up the stairs; we must take it one step at a time. For example, SaverLife member  Gloria  identified having her own place, being in a job for more than a year, and having an emergency fund as financial stability; she was able to pinpoint three separate goals she can start working toward.  2. Budget, track, and monitor  Before spending any of your money, create a  budget . Consider what expenses you must cover and prioritize other spending. Create a plan that will help you easily track your spending, such as using cash for certain expenses. This will help you stay within the budget you set. Monitor your budget to figure out what does and does not work for you on a regular basis. Then revise your plan as needed.  3. Save  Begin saving toward the financial security goals you have identified. Although it may be easy to dismiss saving for emergencies while working toward other financial goals, having an emergency fund is a proven strategy for success. An emergency fund ensures that when an unexpected expense occurs, you have money to overcome the situation. It keeps you from taking away from your other financial goals to deal with the emergency. You never backtrack in your goals when you think of them that way. If you need some inspiration,  Deirdre  explains how she built a $5,000 emergency fund.  4. Negotiate  Women tend to be accepting and appreciative of whatever salary is offered by a prospective employer and are also less likely to ask for a raise. Before simply accepting the pay and terms an employer brings to you, consider whether you should  negotiate your pay . Increasing the amount you bring home could make a big difference in how quickly you achieve financial security, how you prioritize spending, and how quickly you build your emergency fund.   Check out  what other women SaverLife coaches shared  to gain more perspective on the financial power of being a woman.   Now, take a couple of minutes to reflect on everything you’ve just read. What is one step you are willing to take to harness your power? Write down your answer and put it in your wallet to remind you of your commitment.   Gloria and Deirdre, Thank you for being powerful women that are inspiring others this Women’s History Month! I commend you both for sharing your stories. "} 
{"prompt":"What is trailing interest and how do I avoid it?","completion":"What is “trailing interest”? I just got a credit card bill with interest charged after I paid it off!  Submitted by Sasha.  When you are using credit cards, timing is everything. The difference between the date you make a credit purchase and the date you pay can have a huge impact on the “cost of the money” you are borrowing. If you make a purchase and pay before the due date, you fall within the “grace period” for most cards. In that case, you’ll usually pay nothing in interest! That is the financial ninja move we all want to practice because when you do this, you are using the credit card company’s money for free. The catch is, not all credit card companies offer a grace period and some begin accruing interest from the moment of purchase. There are a few things to note here so let’s break it down.  Trailing (or residual) interest is accrued from the time the bill was sent to you (the closing date) and when they receive your payment. If you pay the full current balance online immediately, you can avoid trailing interest.  If you carry a balance on your credit cards, you will almost always pay trailing interest because it is accruing every day (even if you aren’t making new purchases).  Know before you owe  Thinking about your credit card usage before you make a purchase can help you stay on track to pay in full before that interest hits. It’s best to read all of the terms of your credit card (yeah, we know they don’t make it easy). At a minimum, read the fees, due dates, and grace period info. Make sure you understand all of the costs and how to avoid them.  Pay attention to your “statement balance” and the “current balance” as any new purchases and interest will be reflected there. To avoid additional interest, pay the current balance in full. Often, paying the statement balance will avoid interest as any new charges fall into the new billing cycle. Again, this depends on the card company’s grace period policy.  Timing is everything. Using credit cards for your regular monthly expenses can be a convenient way to manage money. Set a goal of using credit cards only when you know you can pay the balance in full. "} 
{"prompt":"When can I apply for a Marketplace Plan?","completion":" Open Enrollment Period  If you buy you own health insurance — versus getting health insurance through your employer — you can review your options and renew or purchase your plan for the upcoming year during the annual Open Enrollment Period (OEP). The Open Enrollment Period takes place each year from November 1 to December 15 in most states. If you’re looking to buy insurance for the first time or enroll in a new plan, this six-week period is your chance to sign up for coverage for the upcoming calendar year. In most cases, if you miss this window you’ll have to wait until the following year to pick, pay for, and get going on a health insurance plan.  Some states that run their own health insurance marketplaces extend the open enrollment period. In 2020, the following states have opted to do this:  Idaho – December 16th Minnesota – December 23rd Rhode Island – December 31st Colorado – January 15th Massachusetts – January 23rd District of Columbia – January 31st California – January 31st New York – January 31st  Even if your state has extended its Open Enrollment Period, you’ll still usually need to enroll by December 15th to get coverage that starts on January 1st.  Special Enrollment Period  There is one exception to the Open Enrollment Period. That’s when you experience a Qualifying Life Event (QLE). Qualifying Life Events fall into three general categories:   A change in where you live (if a move would impact the kind of health insurance coverage you have) A change in your family unit (such as getting married or having or adopting a child) Losing the health insurance coverage you previously had (if your spouse loses their job, if you get a divorce from a spouse through whom you were insured, the death of a spouse or parent through whom you were insured, or if you turn 26 and age off your parents’ insurance coverage).   All of these kinds of life changes qualify you to enter into a Special Enrollment Period (SEP). An SEP lets you shop on the Health Insurance Marketplace just like you would during the annual Open Enrollment Period. Your timeframe to shop and enroll in coverage is triggered by your Qualifying Life Event and not the general time constraints of Open Enrollment — and typically lasts 60 days. "} 
{"prompt":"What Does It Mean to Refinance a Mortgage?","completion":"Let’s start with the basics. Refinancing simply means that you’re replacing your existing loan with a new mortgage.  Reasons for Refinancing a Mortgage  If you’re considering refinancing, your reasons may include:   A lower interest rate  Shorter (or longer) term to pay off the loan or cash out equity  Changing the type of mortgage (you may have purchased your home with an adjustable rate and now want a fixed rate)   How to Decide if Refinancing is Right For You  There are a lot of factors that go into deciding if refinancing your mortgage is right for you. I encourage you to consider:   What’s the point? What is your goal with the refinance?  What is the cost? Refinancing is not free! Do the benefits outweigh the costs?  How long will you be staying in your home?  What other (competing) financial goals do you have? How will this impact those goals? For example, are you thinking of using equity to purchase rental property or improving the home? If you cash out the equity in your home and the value goes down, you may end up “upside down” (your mortgage is higher than the value of the home).   If You Decide to Refinance…  You’re not done when you make the decision – make sure you get the best possible refinancing deal. Here are my top tips for choosing a refinancing option:   Start with a  HUD-approved counselor  to learn about your options and the refinancing process (they will also provide unbiased information on a cash-out refi).  Shop around for the best rates and terms.  Watch how mortgage rates change over time. You may not catch the absolute lowest rates, but do your research so that you don’t fall for a sales pitch and end up with a bad loan.  If you have a trusted banker or mortgage broker, talk to them before you decide to take action. Make sure you understand all of the costs and benefits.   Your home is most likely your largest investment, and refinancing is a major financial decision. Consider all of your other goals and priorities as you gather information. I suggest you talk it through with someone who respects your overall goals and offers objective information. "} 
{"prompt":"How Do You Get a Perfect Credit Score?","completion":"    When you’re ready to start or build your credit, it’s important to understand your credit score. If you understand your credit score, you’ll be able to grow and improve it, maybe even someday achieving a perfect score.  When people discuss credit scores, they are often talking about the FICO Score. The FICO Score, created by the Fair Isaac Corporation, considers different pieces of your spending and credit usage to create a credit score for you. This score is used by lenders to assess your credit risk.  FICO scores range from 300 to 850, with 850 being a perfect score. While it is difficult, if you understand what goes into a credit score and how to use your credit effectively, you can get a perfect FICO Score.  To help you on your quest for perfect credit, here are the five factors that impact your credit score.  1. Paying on Time  Your payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO Credit score. This is the largest category. So, to work towards that perfect credit score, you want to make your credit card payments on time and in full each month. Remember to also make your full loan payments each month. On-time loan payments will also help increase your credit score.  2. Available Credit  This category looks at how much of your credit you use. It accounts for 30% of your FICO score. When lenders look at your available credit, they are comparing how much credit you are using to the total credit available to you. You want to keep your credit usage to 30% or less of your available credit. This means that you do not want to use more than 30% of the credit that is available to you. So, if you have a $1,000 credit limit, try to use $300 or less.     3. Length of Credit History  The longer your credit history, the higher this part of your credit score will be. The length of your credit history accounts for 15% of your FICO score. Initially, this part of your score will be low because you haven’t had credit for a long time. But over time this area will improve as you have and maintain your credit. Remember that if you have old credit cards that you’ve had for a while but don’t use any more, you should keep them open. Just tuck them away somewhere and don’t use them. Closing them will decrease your length of credit history and hurt your credit score.  4. Credit Mix  Your credit mix, or the different types of credit that you have, makes up 10% of your credit score. To improve your credit score and get to 850, you need to have a good mix of installment credit, or loans, and revolving credit, or credit cards. Do not take out loans or open credit cards just to increase your score. But take out loans that you need and can afford to pay back, and use your credit cards responsibly to help your score improve.  5. New Credit  There are times when you need to open a new credit card or take out a new loan, and that is just fine. But opening too many new accounts at one time can hurt your credit score. This is because opening several accounts at one time can indicate that you are a risky borrower. New credit accounts for 10% of your FICO score, so only open new credit when you need it.  Working Towards Your Perfect Score  When you are just starting out, it can seem daunting to try to build your score. Understanding the factors that affect your credit score can help you use them to your advantage. Make your payments on time, don’t use too much of your available credit, don’t open too many cards at once, and maintain a good mix of loans and credit cards. The longer you manage your credit well, the better your score will be. It will take time, but with dedication and good money management, you can work your way to a perfect credit score of 850!

{"prompt":"SaverLife’s Top 5 Tips for Saving Money","completion":"We’ve heard so much great feedback from the SaverLife Community on money hacks they use to stretch their dollars and meet their savings goals.  Let’s take a look at some of the top money-saving strategies that Savers have shared:  1. Negotiating with Bill Companies  “For our medical bills, we got payments reduced by hospital and have monthly payment plans. I always call the company when I can’t pay a full bill, I work with them.”  Credit cards companies and other creditors want to get paid and keep you as a customer, so it is in their best interest to negotiate with you – but they won’t do it if you don’t ask!  Brush up on your negotiation strategies  before you contact them, take a look at your budget, and only offer what you can reasonably pay. Once the hardship passes, revisit your budget and revise your payment plans to reduce the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan.  2. Collecting Unemployment  “I collect unemployment while I’m on break. I pay minimum balances on things and pay it back later.”  I have coached many people who are uncomfortable about applying for public benefits. Social supports like unemployment and food and rental assistance exist to help you through hard times. If you are facing financial challenges, check into  eligibility for benefits  to help you get back on track.  3. Taking It One Day at a Time  “I take it one day at a time. I like being creative. I try to figure it out because I always have in the past.”  Great advice! A mindful approach to dealing with a shortfall may reveal options you overlook if you react to the emotions or try to tackle everything at once. If you have options other than your savings that is great, but if using your savings is the best choice to deal with the situation, do what you must and rebuild when you are financially stable again.  4. Doing Odd Jobs  “We’re always getting by. We haven’t lost anything but we struggle sometimes. We do other odd jobs, brainstorm how to help each other open our own businesses. Soon my son will be in 1st grade, so I could get a full-time job. We’re feeling like we don’t want to just get by anymore, we want to be comfortable.”  Side jobs and short-term gigs can help you bridge financial gaps or can even become a regular income stream. I have been self-employed for more than 20 years. I have never worked harder or been happier.  Fiverr  and  TaskRabbit  are turnkey ways to jumpstart your side hustle.  5. Relying on Support Networks and Savings  “In a low period of income, we count on my girls or borrow from my parents. In a high period, we set aside money as savings.”  Family or community support is often the best way to handle a short-term cash flow problem. And it’s wise to set aside extra money in savings when you have a financial windfall. Don’t worry about the fact that you have to use it. That’s exactly the reason to set it aside!

Picture this : you’re chugging right along making all the right moves to achieve your financial goals then… BAM! Something happens (A car accident? A root canal?) and you must come up with some cash to deal with it. You need  emergency savings  to handle unexpected situations and expenses. Otherwise, a little problem can turn into a big setback.  How much do I need in my emergency fund?  Don’t know how much should be in your emergency fund? That’s okay. Start with a simple solution (that is sure to help you sleep better at night).  Our friends at Nerdwallet have an  easy calculator  to help you figure out a target emergency fund based on your monthly expenses. Now, if that amount makes you scream and toss your computer across the room (don’t do that), you can always start with this approach: add up the amount of all your insurance deductibles (medical, car, renters/homeowners) and set that as your baseline for your emergency savings account. Having the money to cover your deductibles means that, in the event of a serious emergency like a car accident or injury, you can cover the deductible without going into debt.  Being able to cover your deductibles is a great start. With this approach, you’ll be able to deal with the most common financial emergencies. An emergency fund of just $500 will help you feel more prepared and less panicked if an emergency hits. "} 
{"prompt":"What is an Opportunity Cost?","completion":" Opportunity cost is an economics concept with huge implications in every aspect of our lives. To put it simply, when you say “yes” to one thing, you are saying “no” to another.  Opportunity Cost in the Real World  Let’s try an example. Say your goal is to build healthier habits by exercising every day. When you wake up in the morning, you can either get up to exercise as you planned, or you can go back to sleep to get more rest. Both exercise and adequate sleep are important, and you only have time to do one this morning.  So which do you say “yes” to, and which do you say “no” to? There’s no correct answer. And only you can decide which is more important to you at that point in time.  Think about opportunity cost in terms of how you spend your time. In each moment, you can only be in one place doing one thing. There is always an opportunity cost of the other things you could be doing.  Opportunity Cost of Your Money  Opportunity cost is a helpful concept for thinking about how you spend your money. If you spend a dollar on one thing, that dollar is not available to spend on something else (or to save or invest).  But this isn’t about shaming you for spending—it goes both ways. When you save in a retirement account or invest in the stock market, that money usually isn’t available for your immediate needs and wants. That’s another opportunity cost. Those dollars can only be used for one thing.  Consider the Big Picture  So does this mean you shouldn’t save or invest, because that money won’t be available for other things? Of course not! When thinking about opportunity cost, I want you to make all financial decisions with the bigger picture in mind (what you’re saying “no” to by saying “yes” to something else).  When I leave my home and pull up directions for how to get somewhere, the app tells me the fastest route. It doesn’t tell me that the longer route (which takes a whole eight minutes more of my time) takes me along a beautiful reservoir that fills my heart with joy. Most days, I’m willing to give up that eight minutes. "}

Money Market Account  A  money market account  is a step up from a traditional savings account.  They normally have a $1,000 balance requirement to open without a fee. The withdrawals are limited to six per month. The interest rate is a little higher than the basic savings account and is usually tiered. The higher the balance you have in the account, the higher the interest rate you’ll receive.  Certificate of Deposit (CD)  A Certificate of Deposit (CD) pays a higher interest rate as well. When you open a CD at a bank or credit union, you are committing to keeping those funds in that institution for a specified amount of time. You can commit to as little as a few days to several years. This is called the maturity date.  If you are willing to commit to keeping those funds on deposit, the financial institution will pay you a higher interest rate than a savings account or a money market account. Generally, the longer the time on deposit, the higher the interest rate you will earn. You will pay a penalty if you take the money out before the maturity date.  High-Yield Checking Account  A  high-yield checking account  is another alternative. These accounts became popular about ten years ago. They usually don’t have a minimum balance requirement, but instead require a direct deposit each month, a minimum number of debit card uses, or other requirements set by the bank or credit union. If you meet these requirements, you will earn the higher interest rate. If not, you don’t earn any interest and may even incur a service charge.   You can always start with the smaller savings account, and then, as your balance grows, branch out to a money market account or a CD. The important thing is to save!   "} 
{"prompt":"Do I Need to File a Tax Return?","completion":" Hi, I’m Kasey, and I’m a tax expert here with Intuit’s TurboTax. I’m here today to talk about some frequently asked questions that many taxpayers have.  Do I need to file?  Not everyone is required to file a tax return every year. Generally, if your income doesn’t exceed certain thresholds, you don’t even have to file a return. The amount of income that you can earn before you have to file a tax return also depends on:   type of income  filing status  age   Your income that is equal to or less than the standard deduction is not considered taxable and you won’t have to file a tax return. For 2018, if you’re under 65 and single, and your wages are less than $12,000, then you’re not required to file an income tax return.  There are years where you may not be required to file a federal return, but you’ll want to anyways. If you made less than the required amount, but you had federal taxes taken out of your paycheck, then the only way you’ll get that money back is if you file a tax return with the IRS.

So, to answer your question, first ask yourself what kind of work interests you. Then seek education and training while you are currently unemployed. Focus on the skills you need to build. But most importantly improve your worth and skills in today’s competitive job market.  I wish you only the best as you improve your life through skill development. This is a wonderful and admirable use of your time while unemployed.  "} 
{"prompt":"How much should I put in my 401(k)?","completion":" If you’re fortunate enough to have an employer who offers a 401(k), you should seriously consider participating. A 401(k) allows you to lower your tax bill and potentially build wealth through the stock market. Here’s how to figure out how much you should contribute.  The power of the employer match  You should contribute at least enough to fully take advantage of your employer match if you are offered one. If you don’t do that, you are simply leaving money on the table! For instance, your employer may match 100% of your contributions up to 5% of your salary. That means if you make $40,000 and contribute 5% of your salary ($2,000), your employer will contribute an additional $2,000. You are effectively doubling your money before anything happens in the stock market. If I came up to you and guaranteed that I would double your money if you invested with me, would you take me up on that?  Reasons to contribute more than the employer match amount  Should you stop there or contribute more than your employer match amount? Well, that depends on how much you have already saved. A good rule of thumb is to have one times your salary saved by age 30, three times by 40, and six times by 50 for retirement readiness. If you are running behind, you should probably try to contribute more than the employer match amount. Another important factor to consider is your goals. At what age do you want to retire? What type of lifestyle do you want in retirement? It may be necessary to increase your 401(k) contributions to reach your goals.   Small contributions can make a big difference   Contributing to your 401(k) and foregoing that money from your paycheck can seem tough. However, it’s important to contribute whatever you can, especially if you are young and have plenty of time to experience compound investment returns. For instance, based on the historical average of stock market earnings, contributing just $50 a month would grow to an estimated $100,000 in 30 years ($200,000 if those contributions were matched by the employer)! You should consider increasing your contributions as you get older and your income increases. A good rule of thumb is to start by contributing the employer match amount and then increase your contributions by one percent a year.  A 401(k) can be a powerful tool to save for retirement. If you’re not sure how much to contribute, don’t get frozen with indecision and miss out. Just go with your gut and see how it goes; you can always make adjustments later if necessary.  "} 
{"prompt":"Does the New $300 Cares Act Charitable Contribution Deduction Help Me With My Taxes?","completion":" Spoiler alert: Like many things in personal finance and taxes the answer is  it depends . And even when it does help, it won’t be much help for most of us.  First, some background on deducting charitable contributions.  Before the CARES Act was passed this year (2020), taxpayers generally had one option to deduct charitable contributions. They had to itemize instead of taking the  standard deduction . Most of us take the standard deduction because it gives us a bigger deduction than itemizing. A bigger deduction can mean less taxes paid and often a bigger refund.   The CARES Act permits eligible individuals to deduct $300 of qualified charitable contributions as an “above-the-line” deduction. So you can take this deduction without itemizing. To be eligible, these must be cash contributions (cash, check, debit, or credit). And the contributions must be to an organization that the IRS recognizes as eligible for deductible contributions, typically a charitable organization. This deduction applies to Federal taxes and continues after 2020.  What documentation or proof do I need to deduct charitable giving?  If you give $250 or more to one entity, you must receive and keep documentation from the organization acknowledging your contribution. Even if it’s less than $250, the IRS still says you should have documentation. But things like bank records and credit card records can suffice.  But will donations to charity help my tax situation?   For many, it will not help. You shouldn’t give money just to get a tax deduction. If you are at the 10% marginal tax rate, giving $300 at best saves $30 in taxes. That is not a good return. The reason to give should be that it is the right thing for you to do and you can afford it.  Every tax situation is different. If your tax situation includes receiving Earned Income Tax Credit and Additional Child Tax Credit, this may not help reduce your taxes or increase your refund. Here is one example: if you are married, not anyone else’s dependent, and file a joint tax return and your household gross income for 2020 is $24,800 a year or less– this deduction does not help you. You have already maxed your deductions for the year simply by being married and receiving the 2020 standard deduction of $24,800.   What if I’m not sure if it will help?  If you aren’t sure and have someone who prepares your taxes, then ask them. My guess is they’ll say the same thing I am going to say. And that is when you give money, keep the receipts and proof (the proof we talked about above). And then when you go to do your tax returns either bring it with you to your tax professional (or send it) or make sure you enter it in your tax software. Better to provide more information than less when it may help your tax situation.   If you would like to read more about the $300 charitable contribution deduction, I suggest going to  IRS.gov  and reading their tax tips.   Update and Clarification : The IRS has clarified that when filing a Married Filing Separate (MFS) tax return, the maximum charitable contribution deduction for non-itemizers is $150 for 2020. For other individuals and for Married Filing Jointly it is $300 for 2020. Also, for 2021 the Consolidated Appropriations Act increased this charitable contribution deduction for 2021 and later to $600 maximum for those filing Married Filing Joint tax returns. "} 
{"prompt":"What Is Interest?","completion":"The good, the bad, and the confusing! Interest can be your best friend (if you are earning it) or your worst enemy (if you are paying it). Interest is “the cost of money” you pay when you borrow (debt), or you earn when you lend (deposit money in a bank) money.  Of course, our deposits don’t earn nearly what we PAY in interest when we use credit or take out a loan, which is how financial institutions make money. They borrow from us (our deposits) and loan it to others (who pay interest on the loan). "} 
{"prompt":"The 4 Most Common Tax Errors You Should Watch Out For","completion":" It would be nice if we could have a simpler way to meet our tax obligations. But this is the system we have, and unfortunately errors are quite common. Let’s review some common errors that you should look out for.  1. Data Entry Errors  The IRS provides a  list of common errors . The most common issue is data entry errors, such as:  inputting the wrong social security number entering incorrect W-2 info spelling a name wrong  Some of these will be rejected immediately if you’re filing electronically. Some won’t. If it passes through the initial screening, maybe your return will never be right, or maybe it will be flagged later. This can take weeks or months to fix. Perhaps the worst of the data entry errors is to put the wrong bank account number for a direct deposit. So be attentive when entering data into your tax software!  2. Choosing the Wrong Filing Status  The five filing statuses are:  Single Head of Household Qualifying Widow(er) Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately  Filing correctly ensures you aren’t making a mistake that may cost thousands of dollars. There are cases when someone can be married and file as Head of Household, but the requirements are very specific. If you’re married and don’t meet those requirements, you must file either Married Filing Jointly or Married Filing Separate.  3. Incorrect Deductions  A friend may tell you that you can deduct something, and either you or they misunderstand the deduction. But somehow you make it fit into the tax software.  I had a client who deducted her car purchase ($27,000) as an itemized deduction because someone told her she could. She wasn’t self employed or a business owner. There is a case that  if  you itemize and  if  you claim sales tax as a deduction instead of income taxes paid that you  may  be able to add the sales taxes paid for a car purchase to your sales tax deduction. That is two “ifs” and a “may,” and even so, it isn’t the whole car purchase. My client owed the IRS over $2,000, plus penalties and interest. If a deduction sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If you don’t understand the questions the software is asking or it doesn’t look right, then it’s time to  look for professional help .   4. Mistakenly Claiming or Not Claiming a Dependent  This one can be complicated. It comes up often when parents aren’t married. But there are many other situations that involve this error as well. Read more about  when you can claim someone as a dependent . For more help, check out the IRS’s  Interactive Tax Assistant .  I’ve covered four common types of errors, but there are many more possible errors. You can avoid them by making sure you or your tax professional are focused and careful in your tax return preparation.  "} 
{"prompt":"How to Improve Your Credit","completion":" Improving your credit score won’t happen overnight, but you can make a difference over time by taking certain actions.  Step 1: Check for Errors  To start with, pull your credit report from from all three credit bureaus using  AnnualCreditReport.com . Normally, you get to do this once a year for free, but because of the pandemic, you can do it once a week for free! Review each item on all reports to make sure they’re complete and accurate. If you find any errors, you have the right to  dispute them directly  with the credit bureau. The bureau must research the matter and get back to you with an answer in 60 days. If the information is correct according to the bureau, they will leave it on your report.  What most people don’t know is that you have the right to put a 100-word explanation on your report. If you believe the report is incorrect, you can explain your side of the story. It won’t change your credit score, but it may make a difference to the person who is reviewing your credit bureau when you apply for your next loan.  Step 2: Pay Your Bills on Time  The most powerful way to improve your credit score is to pay every bill on time every month, month after month. Your payment history makes up 35% of your credit score. There is no way to go back and change history, but moving forward, pay on time. This will eventually improve your score, but it will take time.  Step 3: Pay Down Your Credit Card Balance  The next area that makes up 30% of your credit score is the balance that is carry on each of your credit cards. Did you know that if the balance you owe is more than one third of the credit limit, this hurts your credit score?For instance, if you have a credit card with a $3,000 limit, try not to use more than $1,000. Once the balance owed goes over $1,000, it starts to lower your credit score. If you have cards with high balances, review your budget and find some extra money to pay down these cards. The faster you get those balances down, the faster your credit score will go up.  Step 4: It Takes Time!  There are three other areas that make up the rest of your credit score: credit mix (10%), length of credit history (15%), and new credit (10%). You want to have a mix of credit accounts such as a mortgage, credit cards, and a car loan. Have you had credit for years or are you new to having credit? And lastly, if you have many new inquiries on your credit in a short amount of time, that will lower your credit score.   "} 
{"prompt":"How much income is enough?","completion":" How much income is enough?  Submitted by Charles A.  We would all like to know this! What is the income we need to lead a happy life? To find the true answer to this question, let’s take a tour of our personal habits.  Enough? For who? Where? With what lifestyle? Will it be enough forever or will it change? How do we achieve this?  Lifestyle Inflation  Numerous studies indicate that the more income we have,  the more we are willing to spend . Thus, if someone loves to buy jeans and increases their income, they will spend more money either buying a more expensive brand, more pants, or both. Does this sound familiar?  The real question we should ask ourselves is: to what extent will I let an increase in income become a new expense? If we experience a sudden increase in income and we increase in equal proportion our expenses, we will have a new standard of what is necessary to live. The problem with this vicious cycle is that it’s easy to acquire a new spending habit but a lot harder to abandon it. At the same time, we also can’t guarantee that we will always maintain our “higher” income.  Income is One Piece of the Puzzle  The question becomes more psychological than financial. While being human gives us the ability to adapt to changes, the process is rarely simple. For example, we can always sell our vehicle and travel by public transportation, but this may make us spend more time getting from Point A to Point B and cause stress for various other reasons.    Finding a balance between our income and our expenses determines our financial success. We have to differentiate between what we want and what we need to live. We may not have enough income for everything we want in life, but can almost certainly say that we’ll have enough to satisfy our needs.   There’s no mathematical equation or magic response that can answer the question of how much income you need. Common sense must reign in each of our decisions. So now, what is your next move?

{"prompt":"Something I ordered online was sent to the wrong address. What can I do?","completion":" I ordered stuff on Amazon and it was sent to a wrong address. I made a dispute with my bank, but they closed the dispute. They want me to pay to have this taken off my credit card statement. But I don’t believe that I owe them. What can I do?  Submitted by Richie B.  I’m really sorry this happened to you! Ordering merchandise over the internet can be very convenient and cost effective. But sometimes, as you stated in your question, it can be tricky! Not only was your merchandise sent to the wrong address, but also your bank refused to remove the charge on your credit card as you requested.  I recommend you try two avenues of recourse that may help rectify your situation.  Step 1: Contact the merchant  Try to reach the merchant by calling, emailing, or contacting them through social media accounts. Hopefully you can get in touch with someone at the company who can resolve your problem. Since they shipped your merchandise to the wrong address, they may be willing to redirect to the correct address or refund your money.  Step 2: Take it up with your credit card company  If you used your credit card, you have additional legal rights under the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA). The FCBA protects consumers from unfair billing practices. It provide a mechanisms for addressing billing errors in “open end” credit accounts. It states that a consumer must contact their credit card company within 60 days of a statement. The credit card company must then either correct your account or send you a written statement justifying the accuracy of the billing.  ***  Between calling the shipper and utilizing the (FCBA) consumer laws, you can either get your merchandise or your money refunded soon.

{"prompt":"Should I Give My Child an Allowance? How Much Should I Give Them?","completion":" It’s never too early to teach your kids about money.  I wish I had learned about the ins and out of money at a much younger age. Growing up, my parents never talked about money in front of me. It was one of those subjects you didn’t talk about with anyone. I had to learn most of my money lessons the hard way.  There are two major schools of thought on paying your children an allowance; there is paying for chores and not paying for basic chores. Let’s do a deeper dive into those options.  Option 1: Pay Allowance for Chores  Paying an allowance when children complete chores teaches that we all work for money. If you don’t do the work, then you don’t get paid. This does teach a real-world lesson. However, the flip side is that many believe you are paying kids to do chores that they should be doing anyway. What happens if your child decides they don’t need the money this week and won’t do chores? I don’t want this to add stress to your life.  Option 2: Pay a Flat Allowance Each Week  The second school of thought is to pay a flat allowance each week. This requires that basic chores be done as a part of the family. This gives children the security of real money each week. However, many believe it teaches children to be entitled because they have money handed to them without work.  Option 3: A Middle Ground  There is a third option that is a combination of the two approaches. You pick and choose the best parts of both options for your family. You can build a plan like basic chores are required with a set allowance, but children have the option to earn extra money by doing extra chores.  Sit down as a family and create a list of extra chores. Here are some ideas: washing the dog, raking leaves, washing windows. Then, when your kids want to earn a little extra money, they can choose an extra chore from the list. Make sure you let your kids know what chores you expect them to do and make sure you keep having the conversation as they get older. This also gives you a reason to continue the money conversation. Make sure you don’t use allowance as a punishment. This is their first experience with money, and we want it to be a positive one.  How Much Money Should I Give for Allowance?  The last part of the conversation about allowance is how much is appropriate. Some experts say $1 for each year of age, but this is a very personal decision based on your financial situation. When you are setting an amount, try to stick to that amount and pay your children in cash so they get used to handling money.  When you start giving your children cash, this is the perfect time to start the discussion of saving, sharing, and spending. Talk with them about saving for a special item, and about putting some of their money away for sharing with others, maybe they have a special organization they would like to help. I love the idea of three different containers so they can see the money inside, and watch it grow which is something we all love to see.  More Resources to Help You Talk to Your Kids About Money  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website has  Money As You Grow activities  to help you start the money conversation with your children, starting at age three. They have great games and activities to help you make learning fun and educational. You can print games and get ideas for starting the conversation based on your children’s ages. With small children, you can start by identifying different coins. With teenagers, you’ll think about buying a car and understanding credit cards. It is all free! "} 
{"prompt":"Can I transfer my HSA to another financial institution?","completion":" I have a HSA through my company. I don’t like their services and investing options. Can I transfer some of the funds I have to a new account at another financial institution?  Submitted by Sudawan K.  Take a moment and pat yourself on the back for planning ahead for your medical expenses. Not everyone does, so I want to acknowledge that you are doing it. Congratulations! I was talking about your question with my #MoneyBuddy  Brandy Baxter , and being the money nerd she is, she got all excited and started rattling off ideas. So here we go!  Tax Benefits of an HSA  First, the money you contribute to your HSA is a tax-planning power play. You contribute money with pre-tax dollars, which lowers your tax liability. Plus, the money earns interest tax-free, and is tax-free when you use it for qualifying medical expenses. This is a great benefit if you or your family  tend to have lots of medical expenses not covered by insurance. Another benefit is the balance of your account rolls over year after year, so you don’t lose any of the money you’re saving.  Finding a New Bank  My first question for you: have you found another bank that has better investment options? If you haven’t, that’s okay. But be sure to do that before making any moves. When you decide to move your funds to another account, they can easily be transferred to another bank as long as the new bank also offers HSA accounts.  Funds Rollover Versus Trustee to Trustee Transfer  This next point is important, so take notes. There are two types of transfers you can do with your HSA: a funds rollover and a trustee to trustee transfer.  We went straight to the  IRS website  to get the lowdown on this topic. A funds rollover occurs when your current HSA account holder sends you a check and you deposit the amount into your new account. Failure to make the deposit into a qualifying HSA account within 60 days of receiving the check will result in a penalty. Yikes! Please don’t make this mistake.  A trustee to trustee transfer is when you authorize your HSA provider to transfer the funds directly to your new HSA provider. This is important, because the money never comes to you in this type of transaction. This means no penalties (or the danger of missing a deadline). Simply ask your new provider to give you a trustee to trustee form. After completing, you’re all set and on your way to earn more money on your investment! "} 
{"prompt":"I own a home, but I would like to move and rent out my home. What’s my best option?","completion":" I own a home that I bought only two years ago. In five years, I would like to relocate to Nevada. I’d like to rent out my existing home to have some net income, but I also would like to purchase another home in Nevada. I have no savings for a down payment for the new home. What would be my best option?  Submitted by Lisa C.  Congratulations on thinking ahead to your future goals and building the wealth to achieve them! Five years is a great timeline to set up a S.M.A.R.T goal.  What is a SMART Goal?  Those letters stand for: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound. Use this as a guide to planning out your goal:  What do you specifically want to do? How will you measure that you’re doing it? Is this goal achievable and realistic for where you are currently? Will you be able to achieve it in the time frame you want?  Crunch the Numbers  Start by doing a little research to figure out how much you may need for a down payment on a new home.  Take the amount you want to save for a down payment and divide it by 5. This will give you an amount to save each year. Then take that amount and divide by 12. This will give you an amount to save each month.  Determine if you can realistically save this amount each month to help cover the down payment. If the amount is too high, start thinking of creative ways to earn extra money so you can reach your goal. Or, set a price range for the future home that gives you flexibility in how much to save.  Research the Rental Market  Next, research to find out if the current rental market will bring enough revenue to cover the mortgage payment on your current home. If so, you may want to rent it now for six months to a year to see if you really want to be a landlord. Being a landlord has its pros and cons. Having a “landlord” experience before you move could help you decide if you want to be a long-distance landlord.  Finally, over the next five years, watch the housing market in Nevada and the rental market in your current area to see how the prices fluctuate and determine how any changes will affect your plan.

{"prompt":"What apps do you recommend to track your spending habits?","completion":"This is the interface of You Need a Budget, one of the budgeting apps I’m trying out currently.     What free or low-cost software/apps do you recommend to track your spending habits? There are so many out there to choose from and some are overly complicated and others require too much work.  Submitted by Brittany.  Let’s check out a few of them and talk about how to choose.  Your Credit Union or Bank  Your credit union or bank probably has an app that allows you to create a budget and track your spending. The challenge, which is true for most apps, is that getting set up can be time consuming. If most of your transactions are electronic, like cards or automatic transfers, this may be the best choice for you since most of your income and expenses will be captured.  Mint  If you use a lot of cash or other cards, Mint might be a better option. Mint is one of the most well known apps and it’s owned by Intuit. One of the strengths of Mint is that it allows you to aggregate all of your accounts (including your bank, credit, investments, and even the value of your other assets), so you have a built-in balance sheet. Mint is still free, but they try to sell products, so beware of that if you choose this app.  You Need a Budget (YNAB)  I’m checking out You Need A Budget, affectionately called YNAB,  again  for the 34 day trial. There is some setup (6 “easy” steps) and it is NOT free, but the cost may be worth it if you are willing to “give every dollar a job” and consult the app BEFORE you make a purchase. This is actually the real value of YNAB: being able to easily check your budget before you spend.  What’s right for you?  So, how do you decide? First of all, it is great that there are many good apps to help you track your spending – but the  best  app is the one that works for you. Check out the few we have talked about here and choose one to try. If you find that in 60 days you aren’t satisfied, try another one (think of it as a “Plan B”) and remember that the point is to find a system that  works for you .  Be gentle with yourself during the set up. It doesn’t have to be perfect to be helpful. Start with your living expenses (what you  must  pay) and add your lifestyle expenses (what you  choose  to spend) over a month or two. Keep in mind that you are building new habits and that can take time. Practice makes better.  Let me know which one(s) you choose to try. If you are joining me on the YNAB trial period, let me know what you think and I’ll do the same at the end of my 34 day trial. "}

{"prompt":"How can I fix my credit to buy a house for the first time?","completion":" My husband and I want to buy a house for first-time buyers. How can we fix our credit?  Submitted by Ferlenzia M.  Owning a home is a dream that many people have. To make that dream a reality, most people get a mortgage loan. To qualify for that type of loan, you need steady income, savings for upfront costs, low debt, and “good” credit. The minimum credit score depends on the type of loan you are getting. For example, a conventional loan requires a credit score of least 620. Alternatively, a government-backed FHA loan allows for a minimum credit score of 580. Both types of loans are offered by most lenders.  If your credit score doesn’t meet the threshold for the type of loan you are seeking, the first thing you should know is that raising your credit score takes time and a history of on-time payments – of at least six months.   Below are some tips for building your credit score:  Correct any inaccurate information  If you find a mistake on your credit report, follow the instructions provided to fix the mistake.  Pay bills on time  Your payment history, or track record of paying your bills on time, is the most significant factor of your credit score. Commit to making on-time payments by preparing and following a realistic spending plan and setting up bill payments systems that work for you.  Minimize outstanding debt  How much you owe is also an important factor of your credit score. Your debt load affects your ability to borrow and how much you can borrow. Keep your debt manageable by borrowing cautiously and keeping balances low on credit cards. If you have existing debt, make a plan to pay it off or down.  Re-establish credit  If you have had problems paying your bills on time, get and stay current on past due accounts. Open new accounts strategically and pay them on time to raise your score over the long term. Your options include:  A secured loan or credit card , where your savings acts as collateral if you do not make your payments. If you are considering a secured credit card, look for one with limited uses and a low interest rate. A loan with a co-signer  – someone who agrees to be responsible for the payments if you do not make them.  Whichever way you choose to re-establish your credit, it is critical that you make your payments in full and on time. With time and focused attention, you can get your credit score where it needs to be to realize your dream of homeownership. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Get Back on Track After a Financial Emergency","completion":"Let’s talk about what to do when the emergency hits. We aren’t trying to bum you out, but the fact is, we are all likely to have a financial shock.  What happens when you have to use your emergency fund?  First, pat yourself on the back for having the funds, and then strategize. Using your emergency fund is not a financial death sentence. You saved it so you would be ready when a financial upset occurs. The key here is to stay motivated. Becoming discouraged about using the money you saved for the very thing you planned is like being upset about eating your birthday cake ON YOUR BIRTHDAY! Who does that?  So, if (or when) you use your emergency fund, remember this:   How did it feel to have the money to deal with the emergency?  What would you have done if you didn’t have the emergency fund?   Then, do this:   Start again  – if necessary, put “emergency fund” back on your list of financial priorities and set aside money each month to get back to your target.  Jumpstart your savings  by practicing a  stretch goal . Even a small amount will remind you of how you felt when you were building your fund.  Just in case : if your emergency need is bigger than your emergency fund and you need a loan, check out your  local credit union  to see if you qualify for a small dollar loan. You will usually find better interest rates and terms than at other financial institutions.  "} 
{"prompt":"Four Tips for What to Do With Your Tax Refund","completion":" Many of us dread filing our taxes, yet we look forward to receiving a tax refund. Those of us with families often use those funds to provide for them.  However, besides paying bills, buying necessities, and using it as fun money, I’d like you to consider using some or all of your refund to improve your long-term financial health.  1. Make extra debt payments  Having debt reduces your options. Paying off your debt allows you to enjoy your tax refund every month of the year! You’ll have more room in your budget for your other financial priorities. And using that money for debt may be a jump start on the path of  becoming debt-free .   2. Boost your savings  Maybe you could use some more money in your emergency fund. Maybe you need to save for your next car.  If you struggle with spending money that is sitting in your bank account, there is another option. When you file your Federal tax return, you can choose to apply your refund or a portion of your refund to US Savings Bonds, I bonds. The I bonds have some inflation protection and the portion of the refund designated for the savings bonds won’t pass through your bank account. Note that you can’t cash in I bonds for the first year and there is an interest penalty if cashed in before 5 years. Your tax software or tax professional may offer this option. If they don’t, look for or ask for Form 8888 to direct some of your refund to I bonds. You can also use Form 8888 to direct your refund to multiple accounts. For example, you can direct some of your refund directly to your savings account and send the money you plan to spend to your checking account.   3. Boost your retirement investing  Your future self will thank you if you contribute to your retirement fund! I still haven’t met anyone who said they saved too much for retirement, but if this is you, please let me know.   4. Bonus – Plan for your taxes next year  You may be able to lower your tax refund by reducing your tax withholding during the year. This could result in more take-home money each paycheck. This may help you manage your monthly bills or savings. You do this by adjusting your W-4 with your employer. The IRS has kindly provided a  withholding estimator  to help you determine the best way to fill out your W-4. Should you decide to make adjustments, remember that if you have changes in employment and/or income you should revisit the withholding estimator to avoid any surprises.   ***  The most important thing about the tax refund is to use it in a way that is best for you. But when your budget supports, please consider these options that may help you be in a better financial position. "} 
{"prompt":"What’s the difference between a bank and a credit union?","completion":"What is the difference between a bank and a credit union?  Submitted by anonymous.  Banks and credit unions serve similar roles in our financial system. Both hold our deposits and make investments to raise money to lend to businesses and individuals.  In general, banks are for-profit businesses. Their profits benefit their shareholders. This is one of the main differences between the two types of institutions. Credit unions are nonprofit entities where you become a “member” (actually a shareholder) when you open an account. While they offer the same services as most banks, they often offer lower fees and higher interest rates on accounts.  I am a fan of banking in your own community (that’s how we use our dollars to create the community we want) and generally recommend credit unions or community banks. "} 
{"prompt":"What Is a Mortgage?","completion":"A mortgage is a loan to purchase a home or land. When you begin planning to buy a home, shopping for mortgages is one of the steps you can take to find out how much you can afford. Mortgages are offered by banks or credit unions and the loan is secured (guaranteed) by the property you purchase.  The process can seem overwhelming, but with good planning and the right help, getting a mortgage for your home purchase may be easier than you think. Check out this  short video  on how mortgages work. "} 
{"prompt":"Why do credit sites recommend I get another credit card?","completion":" I’ve worked hard to get my credit score into the excellent range using only one credit card .  I pay monthly before the due date. Why do credit sites like Credit Karma and Credit Sesame keep suggesting I get another credit card to improve my score even more? What is the impact on a credit score when applying for a new card?  Submitted by Rick D.  Congratulations! You have very positive habits around your credit and debt management. I’m impressed that you pay your bills on time, and many times ahead of the due date. Plus, you only have one credit card and you pay it off every month.  You have maintained excellent credit history (35% of the credit score) and a low credit card utilization rate* (30% of your credit score). Clearly this is sufficient to maintain a high credit score. Length of credit makes up another 15% of your score. Plus, types of credit and inquiries represent 10% of the score each. If you apply for credit, it’s possible that your credit score may dip if you have too many inquiries in the last two years. (Two years is the most inquiries can stay on your credit report by law.)  Don’t feel pressured to apply for credit if you don’t need it. Most lenders advertise to get more loans out to build their loan portfolios. They often use sites like Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, and others to market their loan products. When I was a loan manager at a credit union, my job was to find platforms to sell our loan products. However, it appears your credit and debt are under control. As you indicated, you work hard to maintain that control. So I advise you to continue practicing positive financial behavior and habits!  *Credit utilization rate is the amount of money you owe divided by your total credit limit for those credit cards. Example: You owe $30 and you have a $100 credit limit. That equals a 30% utilization rate. "}

{"prompt":"Forget resolutions – it’s time for a financial New Year’s revolution!","completion":"It’s New Year’s resolution season! Even though many resolutions don’t make it until the end of winter, it can still be a helpful exercise for many people.  Many years ago, I decided to begin each year with a financial  revolution ! Check out how  Merriam Webster  defines revolution:   the action by a celestial body of going round in an orbit or elliptical course (not this one… that might leave me back where I started!)  a sudden, radical or complete change (ah…getting closer. I like it but when I try radical change I sometimes can’t keep it up, so…)  a fundamental change in the way of thinking about or visualizing something (Bingo! This is it!)   Thinking about what you want to do differently can help you align your values with your actions. So, where do we begin?  How was 2018?  Let’s start with what you already know: how was 2018 for you? Reflect on last year and ask yourself:   What worked for you?  What didn’t work?   This is a good starting point for figuring out what you want to change in the new year.  Making measurable resolutions for 2019  With your 2018 finances and financial behaviors in mind, what do you want to do differently this year?  Make sure your goals are measurable. For example, instead of resolving to “save more,” define what that means to you  and  what is important about saving. Do you want to save $20 or $100 a month? Or do you want to save up a specific amount by the end of the year?  A financial goal is usually more effective if we make it SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound). So try something like this:  S : I want to complete the 52 week saving challenge this year  M : I will do this by following the saving plan each week by putting the money in a savings account  A : I can achieve this goal by paying myself first each time I received regular or unexpected income  R : This is important to me because I worry when I don’t have emergency savings.  T : My milestones will be a weekly deposit (on Saturday) and the end goal is $1,378 by December 15th.  Decide how you’ll check your progress. Is there an app you use to measure your savings, or will you check the balance in your savings account regularly?  How will you make it happen?  Now that you know what, when, and how you want this change to happen, it’s time to make a plan and execute! Include check-in points to evaluate your progress and adjust your goals. If there are any resources you need, like an accountability partner or a separate savings account, get that in place as well.  Be realistic with yourself to make sure you’re setting yourself up for success. Doing something differently with money can be challenging, so think about how you’re going to maintain momentum. I’m confident that creating a solid plan to achieve your revolution will improve your chances of following through!  Bonus: Your financial book club!  I certainly know what one of my resolutions is this year: to read and educate myself even more about finances and different perspectives. If you want to join me in this resolution, there are two books that I think everyone should read:   The Richest Man in Babylon  by George Clausen  Mind Over Money  by Brad Klontz   In the spirit of saving, check these out from your local library!     Photo by  Martin Hauenstein  from  Pexels "} 
{"prompt":"Four Myths about Personal Finance","completion":"There are a lot of financial myths out there that simply aren’t true! Making good financial decisions starts with having the correct information you need to make those decisions. I’m going to go through four common myths about personal finance to get to the bottom of those misconceptions.  1. “Paying rent is throwing away money.”  Paying rent is a living expense just like food, clothes, gas, or other transportation costs. This myth is usually coupled with “homeownership is the ONLY surefire investment” (which is also not true). Think about it: the point of paying rent is to have a place to live, right? So, if what you are paying for (a place to live) is getting you what you need, that is by definition NOT throwing away money. Owning a home is a big commitment and it isn’t for everyone. There are lots of  pros and cons to this decision , so be realistic about your needs and which approach best meets those needs.  2. “Bad credit takes forever to rebuild.”  Good credit is an asset! Having bad credit can feel like a hopeless situation. There are some things that take longer to correct on your credit report, but that is not the same as hopeless. There are  a few things you can do right away  to put yourself on track to a higher credit score.  3. “I’m young – I have plenty of time to save for retirement!”  Being young is definitely a major advantage for retirement planning and the fact is, you do have plenty of time. The challenge is that you have no idea what that time will bring (both ups and downs), so the earlier you prepare, the less you will need to save as you get older. Check out this  retirement calculator  to see how much of a perk being young is when it comes to retirement planning.  4. “I’m old – it’s too late to save for retirement”  Every day is a new day. Although you can’t change the choices you made in the past (if you figure this one out, let me know, okay?), focus on what you can do now to prepare for life in retirement. This may mean making some adjustments to the traditional ideas of retirement – that can mean anything and you get to decide what it means for you. I changed careers at when I was over 40 because I simply wasn’t going to have enough to retire in my 60s. If retirement age is approaching fast and you feel like you’re running tight on time, start where you are now.  Get a clear picture of your current situation and then design your “encore” years. Once you know where you are going, you can create a plan to get there. I simply LOVE  this woman’s approach  to dealing with the shift in her retirement reality. "} 
{"prompt":"Create a Spending and Saving Plan: The 80/20 Strategy","completion":"It takes guts to take charge of your money situation and we know you can do it.  Let’s get to work.  How many of us have a budget?  Check this out: we ALL have a budget. Yup, it’s true. We all HAVE a budget; we might not know what it is, but we have one. Money comes in and money goes out – that cash flow IS our budget. You are already spending your money and you are probably spending it on the things you need AND some of the things you want.  The question is, are you happy with the amount you are saving? Not really? We think you might be happier if you decide on a specific amount to save BEFORE spending. Let’s try the 80/20 spending and saving plan.  80/20 Spending and Saving Plan  Divide your income like this:   80% for living expenses (rent, debt, food, clothing, gasoline)  20% for savings (you can break down your savings by categories)  10% for long term goals (retirement/work optional lifestyle)  5% for emergencies ( you know about this, right? )  5% for specific short term goals (vacations, major purchases)     With this  Budget Builder , you can see how your monthly spending compares to recommended estimates in your area.  Remember, you are the boss. Some of us have to spend 90% on living expenses. That’s okay, you’ll just need to adjust your saving amount. The bottom line here is that YOU are in control. Give every dollar you earn a “job.”  For more about the 80/20 rule and making your money work for you,  check out this video . "} 
{"prompt":"4 IRS Tools You Should Know About to Help You File Your Taxes","completion":" Let’s take a look at IRS.gov for some tools you may find helpful as you file your taxes!  Where’s My Tax Refund?  You can check your refund status on  irs.gov  to know whether the IRS has received your refund and is processing it. You can also read more about  how to track your refund .  Download Tax Records or Transcripts  The IRS website can provide your tax records or transcripts. Note that this isn’t a photocopy of your return. If you want that, you have to mail in  Form 4506 . There is a fee for a copy of your actual tax return. Fortunately, tax transcripts are often free (for the most recent ones) and most of us can get them online. There are several different versions, so if you aren’t sure which version you need for a particular year I recommend downloading or printing all of them that are available for the year in question. If you can’t get original tax documents, the wage and income transcript is the one that is most often needed to fix a prior year tax return or to file a return for a year that was missed.  The thing to remember about this transcript is that for many documents, such as W-2s, it only shows the information that is pertinent to the Federal government. So it may not have all the information you would need for a state return. Also, note that the Wage and Income transcript for the current year tax information may not be available until July. So a 2020 W-2 that is required to be filed in 2021 may not be shown on a transcript until July of 2021. You can  request tax transcripts and get more information .  Get Answers to Your Tax Questions with the Interactive Tax Assistant  The IRS has provided the  Interactive Tax Assistant  to help answer tax questions for your particular situation. You can search for your question or choose from the list of common questions. One example is: Is my Tip Income Taxable? Most of the topics take about 15 minutes to go through the assistant, with you answering guiding questions to determine the answer for you.  The Interactive Tax Assistant is a good way to check if what someone tells you is true or if what you are doing on your tax return is right. But it isn’t foolproof, so consult IRS publications and instructions or consult a tax professional if there is any doubt.  Tax Publications and Instructions  I know most of us don’t like digging into tax code to figure out how to fill out forms, but sometimes that is the best place to find your answer. IRS.gov provides a huge number of forms, publications, and instructions in pdf and html format for free. You can also order printed copies if you prefer.  See all IRS Forms, Instructions, and Publications.  IRS.gov is full of information you may find useful. There is even tax news if you’d like to read it! Often going straight to this source will give you the most accurate information, so don’t be afraid to use it. After all, your taxes paid for it. "} 
{"prompt":"Can I file taxes if my income was only SS and SSI?","completion":" Submitted by Veronica C.  Living on only social security income tells me that you are resourceful and doing a good job managing your money. (SS is the benefit that you pay into during your working years and  SSI  is supplemental income designed to provide additional support for specific situations.) This question is tricky because I’m not a tax professional and this falls in the area of tax planning. A tax professional is the right person to tell you exactly what to do. But that doesn’t mean I won’t give you my best thinking on resources! So here goes.  You may or may not be required to file taxes if social security benefits were your only source of income.  Form 703  on the IRS website gives you an idea if you need to pay taxes on your SSI.  The other tricky part is  some of your SSI may be taxable  if your income is above the limits set by the IRS. This is definitely a conversation to have with a tax professional or a  taxpayer advocate .  Visit the website, download the form, and arm yourself with information before you seek out the info you need.

{"prompt":"What can I do when there is an ongoing medical emergency?","completion":"What happens when an emergency is ongoing? My husband had a stroke, and a) can no longer work; and b) now has high medical bills. We’re drowning financially, and it is going to be an ongoing issue.  Submitted by Amy A.  First, we are so sorry your family is going through this difficult time. The first step is applying for benefits to provide some relief as you plan for a new financial reality. If you haven’t already done so, start with the  Social Security Administration . This  checklist  can help you gather the information you need to get started.  Once you have taken this step, you can begin to look into other supports and resources:   Visit  211.org  or call 211 to find organizations near you that provide support.  Savings or other assets in excess of $2,000 can impact your eligibility for some benefits, so it may be advantageous to get the support of a financial coach to help you manage any existing resources in order to stabilize your housing and other necessities.  Visit the  CFPB website  or the  Financial Empowerment Center  network to see if there is a financial coach in your area. Seek coaching or counseling services from a reputable organization that provides services  at no cost to you .   This adjustment will be challenging so be prepared to take the first steps, then assess what you need going forward. It will be necessary to reframe your perspective from “emergency” to “new normal” and take care of yourself during this process. You may have to make some difficult decisions around how to prioritize payments to creditors to ensure your situation doesn’t get worse. This is where having an objective support system (a coach or counselor) can help you make the decisions that are best for your family in the long term.  Self care is crucial. There are many organizations that can provide emotional support (again, 211) as you rise up to the new challenges you are facing.

{"prompt":"4 Ways to Protect Yourself from Financial Abuse","completion":"Even if you are doing all you can to manage your money, we know there are some circumstances where your bank, job, or landlord may be taking advantage of you. These situations can be financial land mines, so it’s crucial to know your rights and get help if you need it.  Let’s take a look at some common abusive practices that can hinder your best efforts to achieve financial security.  1. Where You Bank  We don’t have to look very far to see abusive practices in our financial systems. Payday lenders, for example, charge outrageous interest rates that create cycles of financial destruction. These practices are unfortunately quite common, but we only hear about the abusive practices of more mainstream financial institutions when there is a big incident affecting lots of people.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has an extensive database of complaints that you can check. While not all banking practices are abusive, it’s worth your attention to make sure you aren’t inadvertently giving away your hard-earned money. Check out the  CFPB website  to learn what to do if you have common issues like unauthorized transactions or hidden fees.  2. Where You Work  The  “gig” economy  provides lots of opportunities to bridge financial gaps and generate income to meet basic financial needs. Unfortunately, this way of working has a downside if you’re working with or for an employer that treats you like a consultant to avoid paying taxes or benefits. There aren’t hard and fast rules and each situation is different, but generally, if your boss can decide when, where, and how you work, you are an employee. Being a consultant has some benefits and you can  start here  to learn more about the difference between being an employee or a contractor, and what to do if you are misclassified.  You can also get info on how to manage your taxes as a contractor at the  Self-Employed Tax Center , so you can include payments to your uncle (Sam) in your pricing and budgeting.  3. Where You Live  Evictions, lock outs, and disagreements over security deposits are some of the most common disputes between tenants and landlords. Fortunately, if you’re renting, you can get support from local and federal government agencies. The first thing you’ll notice when you check out the  tenant’s rights page  at the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) webpage is that each state has its own rules, so start at the source and be sure to get information from reputable organizations like  HUD Housing Counseling  in your area. The website also has resources for legal support, housing advocates, and rent stabilization boards or councils.  4. Recognizing Financial Abuse  Financial abuse can take many forms ( domestic/partner ,  senior ) and the first step to address the situation to recognize is to write down what you are experiencing (don’t worry about trying to figure out the solution), identify a trusted resource to help you look at it objectively, and then decide on the best course of action to protect yourself.

{"prompt":"How to Break the Paycheck-to-Paycheck Cycle","completion":" It can be so frustrating when you have more month than money! Everything is a battle and a challenge, just living day to day. The trick to getting out of that cycle is to make a plan for every single dollar. If you decide where you will spend your money before you receive it, you can make better choices and alleviate some of the stress.  Start With a Budget  Add up all of your income for the month. Next, subtract all your expenses. If you are unsure what those are, you need to do a little investigating. Start by going to your bank statement and pulling 30 days’ worth of spending. Then categorize every purchase. You will have food, eating out, snacks and drinks, gas for your car, and any other category you find.    After you have recorded the entire 30 days, add up each column.  Now you know what to put in each expense of your budget. You will want to put your fixed expenses as well. Those are the ones that are the same every month, like rent and car payment. When you subtract all of your expenses from all of your income, do you have a negative number? If you live paycheck-to-paycheck, you probably do.  That means you need to review every line on your budget and determine if what you are spending money on is moving you in a direction you want to go. Sometimes, those small purchases day after day are what keep us from financial security. Is that cup of coffee from the coffee shop making you feel secure or would brewing a cup at home and saving the money make you feel better? Only you can answer that question.  Focus on Your Spending  Then you can find the extra money you need to start saving. Even if you can only save $5 a month, every little bit helps. Having a savings account to fall back on when a disaster strikes will keep you off the paycheck-to-paycheck merry-go-round.  If you are absolutely watching every dollar and still don’t have enough to cover all your necessities, the other option is to add income. There are options other than a part time job (which of course would also help). Think about cleaning a friend’s home twice a month, getting a roommate, or cleaning out that storage shed and having a sale. Brainstorm and come up with an idea that works for you. Think outside the box!  The choice is up to you. You are in control of your situation; you just have to be willing to make the necessary changes and make the hard choices. The good news is, this won’t be forever. As you practice your money management skills and start to master them, you can get out of the paycheck-to-paycheck rut. "} 
{"prompt":"“Sharing is Caring” – Does that Apply to Bank Accounts?","completion":"Ah, opening a joint bank account or credit card – so easy to do, yet so hard to untangle if things don’t go as planned.  Once you open a joint account, the money that was “yours” is now “ours.” That’s a big step for any relationship. Make sure you’re on the same page about how you will manage money as a couple.  Pitfalls of Joint Accounts  Like any financial decision, opening a joint account has risks and rewards. Co-owners of an account can legally spend, give away, or transfer funds to other accounts. They don’t need consent or knowledge of other account holders. This leaves you with relatively little protection.  Before you take this step, make sure you’re confident with your reasons for opening a joint account. What are your goals? Are there other ways to achieve those goals?  Financial Infidelity  As you think about opening a joint account, consider your views on financial privacy and “financial infidelity.” Do you think you or your partner should be allowed to keep some aspects of your financial lives separate and private? The National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE) reports that  over 40% of American adults who combine finances with a partner commit financial deceptions  against their significant other. Plus, 75% of adults say financial deceit has affected their relationship.  Watch Your Credit Score  Joint credit cards can impact your credit score negatively, but they can also improve your credit score! If one partner uses credit beyond their means to pay, this can create financial hardship and conflict.  Check Your Money Values  Understanding how your financial values differ from those of your partner is key to managing money together.  NEFE’s LifeValues quiz  can help you identify the values that drive your financial decisions. I encourage you to take the quiz and compare results with your partner.  If you come out with different results, that’s okay! Use that as a starting point to talk about how you’ll manage different perspectives, behaviors, and values.  Benefits of Joint Accounts  Managing money together can be beneficial for both parties. It’s an opportunity to learn about each other’s money personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. It can also allow someone with lower credit to get more favorable credit terms (lower interest rates, higher credit limits) and improve their credit.  The key is communication. If you can’t talk openly about the pros and cons of opening a joint account, it might be better to manage your money separately until you’re on the same page. "} 
{"prompt":"The 3 Most Common Tax Myths","completion":" Our Federal tax code is complicated. One thing this causes is misunderstandings of tax law. I like to call these misunderstandings “tax myths.” Like many myths, tax myths often have some truth in them. Let’s look at three common tax myths.  1. I Don’t Want to Go Up to a New Tax Bracket  Sometimes people think that if they go up a Federal tax bracket, all of their income will be taxed at the higher rate. This is not true. Let’s look at the first two brackets for filing single in 2020. If your taxable income (after deductions) is $9,875 or less, your tax rate is 10% on this money. But if your taxable income goes up to $20,875, then you are squarely in the 12% tax bracket. That means that $9,875 is subject to the 10% tax rate. The extra $11,000 is subject to the 12% tax rate.  Also, tax credits can lower your effective tax rate, even down to zero. Higher income can cause your taxes to go up and can reduce some tax credits. But if you make more money, you will have more money!  2. Don’t Worry, I’ll Deduct It  This statement implies that your expense won’t actually cost you anything. That is rarely the case. If your marginal tax rate is 12%, then in most cases if you spend $100 that is deductible, you will only get $12 of it “back” through your tax return. And that is assuming it is really deductible.  In the gig economy, many of us have self-employed income. If you have self-employed or business income, you can deduct qualifying expenses. The key is the word “qualifying.” You should know if something is deductible or not before deducting it, or better yet before the spending. Also, if you aren’t self-employed and you aren’t in the position to itemize, meaning you take the standard deduction instead of adding up Schedule A deductions, then most likely you can’t deduct more than the  new $300 charitable contribution  above the line deduction ($600 for MFJ filers for tax year 2021 and beyond).   3. I’ll Buy a House to Reduce Taxes  Most realtors are great people. They help other people realize their dreams. But every year I sit down with clients who are excited about getting the tax benefit for the house they bought. And for most of those clients I have to tell them that the house isn’t going to help them with their taxes. Many say, “But my realtor said I would save on taxes!” That is true only if you are in the position to itemize on the Schedule A and if itemizing will get you higher than the standard deduction. You can either itemize or take the standard deduction. The most typical things people itemize on a Federal return are:   Mortgage interest paid Real estate taxes State and local taxes Charitable contributions There are more, but they are less common  For filing head of household in 2020, those would have to add up to more than $18,650. It would be $24,800 for Married Filing Jointly. Most of us aren’t in the position to itemize that much. So most of us shouldn’t be buying a house to “save on taxes.”  ***  Please leave this article with this recommendation: if someone tells you something about taxes, make sure it is correct before making a decision based on that information. You need to figure out whether it’s relevant for you and your situation. If you have access to a tax professional, then consult them. If you don’t,  IRS.gov  has loads of information organized into tax topics and in their publications.  "}

The average amount a family received was just over $2,400. It’s a good chunk of money, and many families count on it to make ends meet.  How the EITC is different this year  Did you earn less in 2020 than 2019? You could qualify for a bigger tax refund! Congress approved a new “lookback rule” which means you can use either your 2019 or 2020 income on your taxes to get the biggest refund possible this year. Make sure you have your 2019 tax return available when you do your taxes this year.  If you receive the EITC, how does unemployment income impact that credit?   You may have heard me say this before regarding many personal finance questions, but the answer is:  It depends.  In 2020, a lot of Americans received unemployment, particularly after the CARES Act extended unemployment benefits.   Note : This discussion assumes you are qualified to receive EITC.  Explore whether or not you are qualified.  Here’s the bad news. Unemployment income will not increase the EITC you receive, because the tax code does not recognize unemployment income as earned income. And if you have received unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic, you may owe taxes on that income. Check with your tax preparer to make sure.  Being unemployed in 2020 may reduce the EITC you receive. Knowing exactly how unemployment income will affect your EITC depends upon your specific circumstances.  How to calculate your exact EITC  To calculate precise numbers, use the  IRS EITC Assistant . To use this tool, you’ll need to know your income and your tax withholding or taxes paid. You’ll also have to know any expenses or adjustments to your income that may occur. Having your prior year tax return available may be helpful.  Another option is to find a 2020 EITC calculator online. Just be aware, not all calculators differentiate between different types of income. So if you do have earned income and unemployment, they may not give an accurate number, depending on what side of the EITC “curve” you are on.  It’s a lot of information, and there are many nuances, but knowing these details will help you maximize your tax return. Knowing helps planning, and planning helps you have better finances. And we all like better finances!  ***  SaverLife is a nonprofit that helps you save money with helpful tips, a supportive community, and prizes to reward you on your savings journey.

{"prompt":"Why isn’t my credit score improving?","completion":" I’ve been paying my bills every month on time and nothing changes on Credit Karma. I feel like I’m stalking the app. What should I do?  Submitted by Michelle S.  Congrats on paying your bills on time! Can we just celebrate that for a moment?  What Impacts Your Credit Score  Paying your bills will not reflect your credit score unless those bills are payments on your loans. Utility bills are not reported on a credit report unless you don’t pay for a long time and they get sent to collections.  Improving your credit score can take time, so determine if checking frequently is good for you emotionally. Each credit bureau has their “secret sauce” of how they calculate your credit score, taking in multiple factors (not just payment) to reach the final number.   How to Use Credit Karma  Credit Karma is a tool to help you monitor your score and items that are reported to Transunion and Equifax. The credit reporting agencies ultimately are the companies that lenders report to, and how they do so affects your score.  Credit Karma may offer suggestions for banking products that could help you, but be careful with these. The products they refer are their way of getting paid. That’s how the app is free for members (if an app is free, you are the product). If you want to use the information that Credit Karma gives you to improve your credit and FICO score, check out  these tips .  History Matters Too  It is equally important, or even more important, to show good history on your report. When you establish a pattern of paying what you owe, financial institutions take this into consideration regardless of your score.  Your credit score drives your interest rate, but your history will ultimately determine if a financial institution will approve you for a loan. If your report is clean and accurate, your score will rise as you pay your credit accounts on time.  You can check your credit report for free through  AnnualCreditReport  every 12 months for all three credit reporting agencies: Transunion, Equifax, and Experian. "} 
{"prompt":"The Saver’s Credit: Are You Double Dipping on Tax Savings?","completion":" How Do Tax-Advantaged Accounts Work?  When you contribute to a retirement account like an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) or a qualified employer-sponsored retirement plan (like a 401K), you receive a tax advantage. If the account is a traditional account, you may be able to reduce your taxable income for the current year. However, you’ll pay taxes when you withdraw them in retirement. If the account is a Roth, you won’t be taxed on those funds when you withdraw them in retirement. Both types of accounts can grow tax free. And for both accounts, withdrawing funds “early” (before retirement if they aren’t qualified withdrawals) can result in a tax penalty.  The tax advantages of these accounts can really be helpful in building up money for retirement. Which of these accounts is best for you depends on your specific tax and income situation, and your personal preferences.   What is the Retirement Savings Contribution Credit?  For some of us, we can actually double dip on tax savings for retirement. Not only can we get the tax advantages, but we can get the Saver’s Credit as well. This credit is called the “Retirement Savings Contributions Credit.” It’s designed to encourage people to invest money into retirement accounts. You may be able to take this credit for making eligible contributions to your IRA or employer-sponsored retirement plan.  See If You Qualify for the Retirement Savings Contribution Credit  If you use tax software and contribute to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, it should be checking if you qualify. Just make sure you enter the letters and numbers from Box 12 of your W-2 in the software. The more money you earn, the less you get for this credit until it phases out entirely. The maximum credit is $2,000 for Married Filing Joint and $1,000 for all other filers. The maximum contribution that can be used in the calculation is $4,000 for Married Filing Jointly and $2,000 for all other filers. Whether or not you qualify is based on your Adjusted Gross Income, as shown in the chart below for tax year 2020. Also, you must be 18 years of age or older, not a student (generally speaking), and not someone else’s dependent.  2020 Retirement Savings Contribution Credit Amounts   *Single, married filing separately, or qualifying widow(er)  An Example of the Retirement Savings Contribution Credit  If you are single with an Adjusted Gross Income of $20,000 and you contributed $2,000 to your employer sponsored 401K, your credit would be 20% of $2,000. So you would receive a tax credit of $400. Please note that this credit is not refundable. This means if you’ve already reduced your tax liability to zero through deductions and other credits, you won’t receive the benefit of this credit.   There aren’t many opportunities for “double dipping” tax savings in our tax code. If you can take advantage of this one, it can help you improve your finances. But just like other credits and deductions that you may take, make sure that it fits both your financial and tax situation before investing to get this credit.

{"prompt":"What is the Rule of 72?","completion":" Are you considering investing money? If so, you should know about the Rule of 72. It helps you determine how long it will take for your money to grow a certain amount. The Rule of 72 allows you to figure out how long it will take for an investment to double at a given annual rate of return. You can also use it to determine the interest rate you need to find on your investment to have your money double in a certain period of time.  How to Use the Rule of 72  The formula for the Rule of 72 is:    Time = 72/ Interest Rate  In this formula:  Time is the years for the investment to double Interest Rate is the annual rate of return  Rule of 72 Examples  Here is an example of how to apply the Rule of 72. You want to invest $500 at a 6% interest rate. So, it will take your $500 twelve years to double and reach $1,000.  Time = 72 / 6 Time = 12 years  Now let’s look at using the Rule of 72 to determine the interest rate you would need to find in order for your investment to double in a certain time.  You want your investment to double five years from now.  What interest rate does your investment need to earn to make this happen?  5 = 72/Interest Rate Interest Rate = 72 / 5 Interest Rate = 14.4%  Your investment would need to grow at 14.4% annually to reach your goal of doubling in five years.  When to Use the Rule of 72  There are many different calculators and Excel operations that allow you to determine the time it will take for an investment to grow to a certain level. The Rule of 72 is still good to know. It offers a simple way for determining how long it will take an investment to double.  And the neat thing about the Rule of 72 is that it can be used in other areas of personal finance as well. You can use it to find out how often the cost of something is doubling if the cost increases at a constant annual rate. You can also use it to determine how quickly inflation will decrease the value of your savings by half. The Rule of 72 is both simple and useful and allows you to think about changes in your investments and costs in a more concrete way.

{"prompt":"What is private mortgage insurance?","completion":" If you get a conventional loan and make a down payment of less than 20 percent of the home price, you are required to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI). PMI protects the lender (not you) in case you fail to make your mortgage payments.  Banks, savings associations, credit unions, and mortgage companies make conventional loans to creditworthy borrowers at interest rates based on market conditions. The federal government does not insure these loans.  It’s important to note that PMI pays for losses that a lender has because of foreclosure. It protects the lender in case you default on the loan. It will not pay your mortgage loan payments.  How does private mortgage insurance work?  PMI has an annual premium. This premium is divided by 12 in the form of a monthly charge added to your mortgage payment of principal, interest, (property) taxes, and (property) insurance (PITI). Even though you’re the one paying, PMI is protection for the lender in case you default on the loan.  How much does private mortgage insurance cost?  The cost of PMI varies. Generally, borrowers who are a higher credit risk (lower credit score) pay higher fees for private mortgage insurance.  When can I stop paying for private mortgage insurance?  PMI is automatically canceled when your mortgage balance reaches 78 percent of the original value of the house. However, there are exceptions. If you have a high-risk loan, have not been current on your payments, or have other liens on your property, your PMI may continue. You can also cancel your PMI through written request – with the exceptions listed above – when you reach 20% equity in your home based on the original property value.

{"prompt":"The Three C’s of Credit","completion":" When applying for a loan, it’s helpful to know what your Loan Officer will be looking at when making his or her decision. There are three areas they will review: Capacity, Collateral, and Character.  Capacity  Capacity is simply your ability to repay the loan. They will review your monthly income and expenses to determine if you can afford to make the monthly payments. They will consider open lines of credit as well. If you were to max out all the lines of credit available to you, would you still be able to make the payment or would you be over-extended?  Collateral  Next is collateral. Do you have something of value that you can use as collateral? Essentially you would be saying, “If I don’t pay this loan, you can take this piece of property and sell it to pay off the remaining balance.” For example, for a mortgage loan, your home is the collateral, and for a car loan, your car is the collateral. The lender may determine the amount they are willing to lend you based on what they think the collateral is worth. In other words, you can’t borrow $200,000 on a house valued at $75,000.  An un-secured loan is a loan without collateral. The lender is offering the loan strictly on the value of your good name.    Character  Third is character. The lender will review your credit history to see how you’ve handled debts in the past. Did you pay on time every month and pay the debt in full? Or did you settle any of the debt or declare bankruptcy? These questions aid in revealing how you are likely to handle debt in the future.  Keep these three C’s in mind if you plan on doing any borrowing in the future.  You will want to present your best self to your loan officer. "}

{"prompt":"How do you balance debt and savings? Here’s what our research found.","completion":"If you’re paying down debt, saving money may be a low priority for you. After all, you’re probably paying interest on your debt every month, so paying off your debt more quickly means keeping more money in your pocket long-term.  It’s harder to save when you have debt  Our research found that Savers with a very good or excellent credit score (the two highest categories) were more likely to save at least $20/month than Savers with lower credit scores. Savers who had no debt or a manageable amount of debt were also more likely to save.   What do the experts say?  Many experts believe that maintaining or building a small emergency fund is crucial even if you have debt. SaverLife’s Financial Coach Saundra Davis agrees. She says many people ask her, “Should I save or pay down my debt?” Her recommendation is  a balanced approach . Focus on paying down debt, but don’t eliminate saving entirely. "}
{"prompt":"Allison’s Story: No Such Thing as Over-Prepared","completion":" Meet Allison, a Data Analyst who lives in Winooski, Vermont with her three roommates.  What do you do?  I am the Manager of Data Analytics for a home health and hospice agency. I’ve been here for a year and a half, and really love my job. I have a lot of autonomy, and I get to make a lot of my own decisions and am treated with respect.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My parents divorced when I was in second grade, so I essentially grew up in two different households. I was seeing one method from my mother and nothing from my father. What I saw from my mother was what I thought was good at the time because the lights never went out and we always had cable. As I got older, I realized she was juggling bills. She was paying only some bills every month and was barely keeping things afloat. This meant we rarely had extra money.  A byproduct of this is that when we did have extra money, we thought, “We should do something with this.”  When I was on my own financially, I didn’t know it was bad practice to not have money the day before payday. I always thought it was okay to be right down to the penny before you got paid the next day. It’s taken a lot of work to get away from that. Things like buying an extra pair of shoes or going out one last time right before my next paycheck hit my bank account seemed normal.  What is your proudest financial achievement?  I was gifted $5,000 in 2011 that I used as a down payment on a condo, which cost $87,000. Given that I had just graduated from grad school, this was a blessing. I spent the next six years living there and slowly fixing it. I was able to sell it for a $75,000 profit. It wasn’t just that I bought it at the right time at 2011 and sold in 2017 at top of market. I also made smart choices when I was renovating it. The condo needed new paint flooring and countertops, but there were no issues with the furnace or plumbing. I was able to take the money I earned from my fixer upper project and buy a house. I was able to get many, many returns on that initial gift.  Allison receiving the keys to her condo  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  It’s cliché, but “live within your means.” More specifically, look at where you’re spending. Figure out what you’re spending versus what you’re bringing in.  How do you apply that financial advice to your life?  I like to budget. I usually keep a one-page monthly calendar of what I need to pay. Sometimes I still struggle paycheck to paycheck, so I look at my payday dates and make sure that I’m paying all my bills. Then I look at what optional spending I might have at any given time. I forecast out my budget for a year at a time. I look at what regular bills I have and what other expenses I can anticipate, and that allows me to see if and when I’m going to be short on cash. It allows me to plan projects for my house as well. I find that when I have a plan for money, I do better with my money than when I don’t.  How do you juggle your multiple incomes?  I own the house and I have roommates who pay me monthly. One roommate pays bi-weekly, which works best for them. I also have a side job  doing billing for a physical therapy practice. I take those hours and trade them in for a massage. It’s a great deal!  What are your goals for the future?  In the short term, I have some medical bills that I’m trying to pay off. My end goal is to have a reserve that could help me cover $2,000 or more in case of things like medical bills. I want to be better prepared to handle those kinds of situations.  I also want to learn how to be better at saving. I’m good at it when there’s something I’m saving for like a dress, but I’m really bad at saving money long-term.  I still have student loans that I’m trying to pay off. I use the app EarnUp for my mortgage, car loan, and student loan because it pays you bi-weekly instead of once a month. It’s helping me pay off my loans faster.  My ultimate goal is to be debt free and just live on cash. I also hope to pay my car off with EarnUp and put that money in a bank. It means I’ll be buying a good second-hand car that will get me to where I need to go. I also want to continue to not have credit card debt.

{"prompt":"How to Figure Out Your Voting Plan","completion":" Your vote matters. Candidates you elect support policies and laws — and sometimes, help dismantle systemic barriers — that directly impact your financial security. Voting is one of the most important ways you can influence policies and laws and help determine who represents your interests in government.   Your vote is just as powerful as any billionaire’s. Especially in a time when there’s so much at stake, your vote doesn’t just work — it matters.      But your vote only counts if you manage to vote! Once you’ve registered to vote, you need a voting plan. Studies have shown that people who plan out their voting day in advance are more likely to take action and cast their vote.   Read on for a quick outline of what your plan should include.  1. Where is your polling place?  If you’re planning to cast your vote in person, you’ll need to know where your local polling place is located. Every registered voter in the U.S. has an assigned physical polling place, and that location can change from year to year.  To find your assigned polling place, check the Vote.org list of state polling place locators below. Once you choose your state, you may have to enter some personal information in order to receive polling place details.  Check my polling place  Alternately, call your state or local election office.  Find your election office here.  2. What are your polling place’s hours?  Don’t assume your polling place will be open when it’s convenient for you to go. Check the voting hours at your specific polling place. Then make a plan for when you’re going to get there on Election Day. Will you vote on your way to work in the morning? On your lunch break? After you pick up the kids at school? And importantly, do you need to ask for time off in advance in order to make it to your polling place?  3. How are you going to get to the polls?  Knowing how you’re going to get to your polling place is an important piece of the puzzle. If you have a reliable car and plan to drive, great. If you can walk, take public transportation, ride a bike, or skateboard, that’s great too.   But if none of these alternatives are options for you, you’ll need another plan. Here are a few suggestions:  If you’re in a major city with ridesharing options, note that  Lyft ,  Uber , and  Lime  are all planning initiatives to support voters getting to the polls.  Carpool with neighbors, perhaps by connecting on a service link  NextDoor . This is also a great way to encourage others to vote! Certain local organizations and volunteer services make a point to mobilize and help voters in need get to the polls. Look for information in your local newspaper or via a Google search.  4. What are you going to bring?  Voter ID laws vary from state to state. Some states require you to show a valid photo I.D. from a list of official options. Others will accept a bill with your name and address on it, and some don’t require any ID at all. Make sure you know what’s expected at your polling place.   Check your ID requirements  5. Who and what are you going to vote for?  Here’s the hardest part. How will you vote?   It’s tough to find nonpartisan information these days. One resource is BallotReady, which explains every candidate and referendum in as objective terms as possible.   By entering your street address, you can see a full breakdown of which candidates you’ll be able to vote for in the next election. By drilling down to a particular candidate, you’ll see that person’s credentials, as well as their voting record and stance on issues such as abortion, civil rights, criminal justice, healthcare, housing immigration — and even coronavirus.   See voting options  6. What else can happen?  Having a plan for Election Day is so important. But what if something goes wrong? What if you get to the polls in time, but there’s a long line, and the poll is scheduled to close before you get  to the front? What if you experience intimidation or harassment at your polling place — or you’re told that you’re not on the voter roll, even though you’re sure you registered to vote?  Vote.org has a great resource on  Election Protection . It addresses all of these scenarios and more. If you have a smartphone you plan to take with you to the polls, consider bookmarking the page. Alternatively, review the information in advance and either print it out or commit to memory.

Well, I’m disabled, but I don’t let that get the best of me. In fact, right now I run four businesses: childcare services, Legalshield, Herbalife, and Blast Ave with my business partner, Helen.   I want to buy a house and leave a legacy for my family, and that’s why I’m working so hard.  What does a day in your life currently look like?   It changes day-by-day, but today I was busy driving around New York running errands: going to doctor’s appointments, picking up my grandkids, checking in on my Legalshield business, taking care of my pets, and going to meetings. It’s usually late by the time I get home.   I always have something to do. For example, I’m helping a friend get her business off the ground.   Have you received any or all of the stimulus payments?  I don’t remember receiving the first one, but the second and third ones went toward paying my bills for those months.    What do budgeting and saving look like for you?  I know how to pay myself first. Every time I receive my paycheck, I try to save at least $100 in my savings account. Actually, the only reason I got to that amount was because of the  Race to $100 .  The  Race to $100 savings challenge  motivates me and keeps me coming back to SaverLife. If I make more money in a given month, I try to put that toward my savings goal.

I live in Oregon City in a low-income apartment. Compared to when I first moved in, nothing has really changed except now the economy is different.  In our email communication, you mentioned that you’re disabled. Has the coronavirus impacted your everyday life?   My wife stays at home and I do the shopping. I call her when I’m at the store, then send pictures of what’s available. Depending on how much I have to pick up, I take my foldable cart.   Personally, I fall in the “at risk” category because I’m Type 2 diabetic and disabled. I feel cheated out when I go to the stores and try to buy things for my household. Because my wife and I don’t have a car, I have to walk to the stores. The three closest grocery stores within walking distance are the Grocery Outlet, Safeway, and Frey Meyers.  It’s harder for people with no car. Most places here you need a car because buses don’t cut it. For instance, you can’t even get fast food because they only do drive through. It kind of seems discriminatory. I honestly feel discriminated against that I can’t do things like that, even more so now because of coronavirus.  What’s your financial situation been like recently?  We had to borrow some money. We’re lucky enough that we were able to borrow the money or we’d be out of luck. My wife and I have been doing online shopping on Walmart because they offer free shipping on orders $35 or more. The only downside is the stores aren’t keeping up with the demand and nothing is being restocked in time.  It was really hard for my wife to find work even before this whole coronavirus thing. In this time of crisis, there’s no way to save. I only get $783 a month from disability. Thank goodness I only pay $127 a month for rent. I also get food stamps, which helps. But every time my disability paycheck goes up, my food stamps go down.  Have you notice any significant changes when trying to purchase items online?  I noticed someone was selling cans of Lysol for over $500 on eBay. This is how I’m learning how hard the virus has hit the US. The prices online are racked up because they’re essentials. I’ve even seen a single can of Lysol going for $50. Luckily enough, I bought a 144oz container of Pine-Sol a while back. I looked online recently, and it was out of stock.  What’s it like being on food stamps at a time like this?  I get them on the 2nd of every month, but I’ve still got to fork out cash for us to last until next month.  Do you think your life will be different when the pandemic is over?  I don’t know if it’ll be significantly different, but I imagine that I’d be able to find things on the shelves. Right now, by the time I get paid, it’s gone.  Life could be more normal right now if we had better policies in place such as not being allowed to hoard things or setting a maximum that you’re allowed to buy of some items. Stores have to be stricter with these things. They need to have the national guard in these stores to make sure people are getting what they’re supposed to be getting. Everybody needs something. If you’ve got all the soap, how are other people supposed to wash up?  It makes me tear up to hear stores opening up an hour early for elderly and immunocompromised to get stuff they need. When I go there, it’s empty. Also, our truck drivers are busting their butts to get us what we need, but people keep hoarding it. "}
{"prompt":"Christy’s Story: Grandparents are the Gifts That Keep on Giving","completion":" Meet Christy, the director of nursing at a nursing home who lives with her husband and three daughters in South Carolina.  What’s your household like these days?  With daughters, it’s tears and laughter and glitter 24/7. Things have certainly been different since the girls started virtual school, but we’re getting used to it.   On a typical day, I wake up at 6am and get the girls up and fed. By 7:50am they’re online doing virtual school, and that’s around the time I head to work. My husband works nights, so I make sure he’s situated before I leave for the day. Depending on the day, I usually work 8-10 hours, maybe go home to eat lunch with my family, go back to work, and then I come home for supper. Then I go to bed and start over again the next day.  My girls are in kindergarten, third grade, and fourth grade. It’s been a learning curve for all of us for sure. With my oldest daughter, school isn’t her forte, but there are less distractions at home so she can concentrate more. My middle child is what I like to call the “little mother” because she helps our youngest with anything she needs. My husband and I have done our best to be proactive and help our kids learn, and we’re in constant communication with their teachers.  We’re also lucky that their great grandmother is still in our lives. She loves teaching the girls new skills just as much as they love learning from her.   It sounds like your grandparents are a big part of your life. Could you tell me more about them?   They’re 81 and 85 years old. They helped me make my way through my nursing school. My grandma was kind enough to help me study and I like to joke that she should’ve gotten a degree in nursing alongside me. She’s also taught one of my daughters how to knit and another one how to cook.   My grandpa loves music. He’s trying to get each of the girls to pick an instrument they want to play. He recently bought them an electric keyboard.   I don’t know what I would do or where I would be without them.  What do you and your family do to relax?   We’re really trying to unplug more. When I’m home, we try to do outdoor activities. For example, my girls wanted to plant a garden this year. We failed miserably, but there’s always next time. All my daughters like to read, so we’re reading  Charlotte’s Web  at the moment.   What’s it like with you working during the day and your husband working at night?  We make it work. My husband was unemployed for about five months after the COVID-19 pandemic hit. There were a lot of jobs he was supposed to do that just got postponed or canceled.    As for me, my job is more demanding and difficult than ever. We’re busier and stretched thinner these days. There are more precautions we’re taking like screening everyone who comes in, taking their temperatures, and wearing masks. I used to work in a long-term care facility before this. It’s especially tough for the residents because the facility isn’t allowing visitors.  Are you shopping during this holiday season?   We’re shopping for immediate family only this year. Trying to plan what holiday gatherings will look like this year has been hectic, but we’re lucky that the majority of my family lives in town. We did a virtual Thanksgiving with my cousin in New York, and hopefully him and his wife can quarantine themselves and join us for Christmas this year. We’re still playing it by ear.  I’ve talked with my girls about what gifts might look like this year. It’ll be tighter than normal but we’ll make it work. They’ve been really wanting Nerf guns, and my husband and I may have to splurge and get two for ourselves so we can join in on the fun, too.   What does saving money look like?  We had a house fire a couple years ago that we’re still trying to build back from. It was a big ordeal. We eliminated our savings trying to recover from that. In the last couple of years, we managed to build our savings a little, but after my husband lost his job earlier this year, we had to use what savings we had left in our emergency fund to stay afloat. Right now, I’m just trying to re-establish our savings. I’m hoping we won’t have to spend money to repair our car within the next five years.  Recently, I set up an Acorns account and tried to squirrel away a bit of money there.   What would you like to do when things get better?  I think that we’d all really enjoy a trip out of state. My grandparents really want to go to California. We’ve never traveled outside of the South, so that’d be a fun vacation to take.  Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  Not going bankrupt when my husband lost his job and managing to keep out of the red as best I could. You have to appreciate where you are. Without understanding what trials you’ve had, you can’t fully enjoy your triumph.  My goal is to have a nice retirement account and set up a fund for my girls’ college expenses.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I was on Google searching for resources to help us when my husband was unemployed and that’s how I found SaverLife. SaverLife introduced me to Steady, too. I love the articles and I’ve enjoyed  earning points for doing activities . I even  won $5 once  which was really exciting! I think SaverLife is a wonderful resource for anybody that  doesn’t know where to start with saving or is struggling with saving . Right now, people need help in a loving and kind way. "}
{"prompt":"Destiny’s Story: Prioritizing Her Family’s Financial Security","completion":" Meet Destiny, a customer service representative who lives with her four children in Virginia.   How’s it been sheltering in place?  It’s just me and my four boys here at home. Sheltering in place was much harder when it first began. Now that things are starting to reopen and I’m going back to work, it’s becoming a little easier. It can get overwhelming at times, but we’re making it through.  What does a day in your life currently look like?  I wake up, get ready for work, get the kids ready for daycare, work for six hours, pick the kids up, come home and cook dinner, put the kids to bed, then go to sleep and start all over again the next day.  What’s your profession?  I just started as a customer service representative at a call center in July. It’s been good so far, and I’m glad to be at work. Sitting at home every day wasn’t great for me and my boys.  My hours changed just a bit, but I’m lucky that I got to pick when I work. I work 9am to 3pm, so I schedule what I have to do for my kids outside my working hours.  How are your kids attending school this year?   I have two kids that are school-aged and two that go to daycare. The two that are in school are doing virtual learning. It’s the first time they’re learning this way, so it’s going to be an interesting school year. It’s a lot different compared to what we’re used to.  I can already tell it’s going to be tough having the kids at home 24/7 and being their teacher while working full-time as well. Even though it’s a challenge, it’s nothing I can’t handle. Hopefully, we can get into the groove of things and get some type of routine going.   Any long-term savings goals?  My main thing is saving for a house. Besides that, I’m saving for a rainy day. You never know what’s going to happen.  How do you envision your family’s future?  I want to buy a house for myself and my kids. I’d like to have a car that’s paid for that I’m not making payments on. I want to have something that I own that I don’t have to worry about being taken away. Eventually, I want to get married. Lastly, I just want my family to be financially stable and have a career.  I don’t want my kids to have to want for anything. Most of the time, I’m living paycheck-to-paycheck, but I want to build financial security for my family.   What does financial security mean to you?  It means having a well-funded savings account. A lot of times, I’ve had to ask my family members for money to pay for things or get gas, and I want to be able to provide for my kids without asking for help.  Do you talk to your kids about money?  They have to do chores in order to earn their allowance. I want them to grow up and understand the value of money. If I just give them money, they’ll keep expecting it without having earned it. I don’t want them thinking people are entitled to have money given to them.  I don’t think I had much guidance when it came to money management growing up, so a lot of what I’ve had to do and learn, I taught myself. I just want to make sure I teach my boys everything about finances so it’s not difficult for them growing up.  What would you like to do after this is all over?  I want to take my kids on a vacation. It’s something we try to do every year, and because of COVID-19, we weren’t able to this year. I just want for them to see and explore new places.  Going to the beach first would be my priority. My 4-year-old has been talking about the beach for some time now, and I really want to be able to take him there. That’s something he’s looking forward to.   What does saving and budgeting look like for you?  I haven’t actually been saving lately. Before I started working again in July, I had to count dimes and watch my family’s spending. Since I’m back to work now, I want to start saving $30 per paycheck.   When I put my budget together, I prefer to write it out using pen and paper. I like to see the amounts in front of me. Nothing against the mobile apps, I just prefer to do budgeting myself.   Writing it down makes me feel like I’ll remember it better, too.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I love it! I try to get on the site at least once a week. The  forums  and  articles  are really helpful since I’m working on my financial security.  "}

{"prompt":"How do you use your tax refund?","completion":"Every month, part of your paycheck is sent straight to the government to pay your taxes. But at the end of the year, most people owe less than they’ve already paid – so they get money back from the government. These tax refunds are a huge influx of money for many American families.  If you’re struggling to save every month, your tax refund can be a great way to get started. After all, without knowing it, you’ve been putting away money every month that you can’t touch! Even if you already have a plan for your tax refund, putting some of it into savings can go a long way.  How Savers Used Their Refunds  SaverLife Savers received an average of $3,464 in refunds in 2018. Here’s how they said they used that money:   As you may have noticed, these numbers add up to more than 100%. Savers often told us they used their refunds for multiple goals.  One Saver named Rocio told us, “My tax refund is a blessing because I can tell my son that I am able to pay his school classes and education.” Another Saver named Cortney said, “I wanted to save my tax refund, but I had to have some car repairs done, so most of my tax refund went toward that.” "}
{"prompt":"What does saving mean to you?","completion":"At SaverLife, we talk a lot about how important it is to save. But defining what it means to save is surprisingly difficult!  Consider this scenario: You transfer $5 from your checking to savings account every week all year. At the end of the year, your car needs some repairs. You withdraw all the money you’ve saved to pay for car repairs. It’s a necessary expense, but it’s still depleted your savings. Have you saved this year?  There is no right answer to this. Some people say yes, this is saving because you had the  habit  of saving money. But other people say no, this is not saving because the  balance  in your savings account is the same as it was a year ago.  It comes down to this: Is saving a behavior or a balance?  Saving for Soon  Earlier this year, we ran a campaign called Savers Win, where SaverLife members pledged to save their tax refunds and won prizes. If you participated in Savers Win, you may have answered a survey from us about whether you actually did save your refund.  When we looked at at your answers, we noticed that people were describing the same behavior in different ways. For example, one Saver told us that she saved her tax refund to pay for an updated glasses prescription. Another Saver told us that she ended up not being able to save her refund – because she bought new glasses!   If you’re trying to start saving, how do you define saving? How do you know whether you’ve been successful at saving this month – your savings balance or the behavior of saving regularly? "}

{"prompt":"Meet Derkisha, SaverLife’s $5,000 Grand Prize Winner","completion":" Derkisha is a SaverLife member, a nursing school student, and a mother of five. She was one of over 45,000 people who pledged to save their tax refunds with SaverLife, collectively pledging to save more than $60 million.  The SaverLife team traveled to Texas to surprise Derkisha with the news that she was our Grand Prize winner and won $5,000. See what happened!     Right now, Derkisha and her children are living in a temporary home. “I’ve made it our home and it looks like ours,” she says, “but it’s not permanent. That’s what I want for my kids and myself.”  “I’ve had my ups and downs,” Derkisha says. “But I’m proud of how much I’ve grown. I want to work to improve myself and my life.”  Derkisha is currently getting her degree in nursing. When she graduates and starts working, her goal is to buy some land and build her “forever home” – a home where her kids can play and be safe, and come back to when they are older. The $5,000 will go straight into savings so that she can make that dream a reality. "}
{"prompt":"Michelle’s Story: Happiness Is Contagious","completion":" Meet Michelle, a former health insurance agent who lives with her two granddaughters in Wisconsin.  What’s it like where you live?  I grew up in Wisconsin and I’ve been here for 52 years. I have a 33-year-old son who doesn’t live with me, but I’m taking care of my two teenage granddaughters, so that’s who’s in my house. The youngest has been with me for eight years, and her older sister has lived with us on and off for the last three years. It’s nice getting to raise kids again!  Do you currently have a profession?  Right now, I’m not working. I’m waiting to receive disability benefits. When I was in the workforce, I sold health insurance for 25 years.  What does a day in your life currently look like during the COVID-19 shelter-in-place?   I’m constantly running errands because I take care of my mom and my aunt, who both have onset dementia. They’re always asking questions like, “Where are we going?” or “Are we there yet?” They’re a handful. These days, I have to take them to their various appointments while also balancing homeschooling my two grandchildren. I’ve also had my physical therapy appointments canceled on top of all of that.  I have a full-time schedule taking care of my mom, aunt, and two grandchildren. My sister has bronchitis and pneumonia, so I drop off groceries to her house when I can. Plus, I have three dogs that I take care of. They keep me busy. They always want to go outside to play fetch, and they love to go in and out of the house every ten minutes.  Has your life changed in the past few weeks?  Our town is on lockdown like everywhere else. Only the essential places are open, like grocery stores. The stores are even limiting the amount of people who can go in. We live in the city, and all the big businesses and malls around us are closed. It’s very strange.   Most of our normal doctors’ appointments have been canceled, and everything has been put on hold. I had a surgery that was supposed to happen, but it’s been postponed.   I try to order carry out from a local restaurant for my mom and my aunt when I can, and I only run errands for them once a week to help them out. The local restaurants offer a limited menu these days, and some are only open for three to four hours for carry out. I want to help support our community since most of the restaurants and bars around us are run by small business owners.  How have your finances been these past weeks?  At this point, they’re pretty bad. I just terminated my lease for my vehicle. I’ve also been trying to file for disability since 2016. I previously filed, but I needed to redo it, and it’s a lengthy process. Since I haven’t been able to work, I’ve been living off my retirement money, but I’ve had to pay 35% in withdrawal fees since I’m not of age to withdraw without penalties. Since my granddaughters live with me, I get $500 from kinship, but it’s not much. During the summer, I have rummage sales to make ends meet. I’ve sold my pool table, my boat—everything I’ve worked for. Anything I could sell, I did.  Nowadays, I take surveys and participate in online research groups to make money and get my bills paid. I use Energy Assistance to help me with my energy bill, and it’s been turned off in the summer before. I’m also on the Food Share Program, which has helped a bit. At this point, everything is month to month, and I pay down whatever I can come up with.  On top of all that, I can’t afford to pay my credit cards off. I have three liens against me. It costs $2,500 to file for bankruptcy, and I can’t even afford to do that.   Are you hoping disability pay could bring some financial relief?  If I could receive the amount my case managers estimated, that would really help. In addition to the disability pay, if I could also receive my social security award letter, I could imagine myself getting by financially.   I was told recently that because the social security offices are closed, everything is on hold. They’re not going to take my new case since it was re-filed in February. Most likely, my case managers said that I probably won’t get back pay. It’s all up in the air right now. It might not be until the end of the year that I hear anything back.    Are you also financially supporting my mom and aunt?  Fortunately, they receive their social security checks since they’re both older now.   How are you feeling about your situation right now?  I try not to stress about things too much. I’ll get random checks in the mail from either a class action lawsuit cases from seven years ago or rebates from items I’ve previously purchased. I pray that a higher power keeps me afloat until I can get back on track. I’m always taking care of everyone else. I’d have so much more money if I only had to worry about myself. I try not to let it get to me.  Usually, my tax refund will be around $2,000. I divide that by 12 months, and that money each month helps me pay off my bills.   What would you like to do once things go back to normal?  I’m actually peaceful and I enjoy not having to run, run, run all the time. It’s nice to not have my days super filled with errands all day long. I don’t get to do much anyways since I don’t have the money in the first place.  However, I am looking forward to going to state and county fairs and festivals again because they’re inexpensive to attend. I’m not too anxious to go into the rat race of a world just yet. I enjoy having this time to myself.   Earlier this week, I was just talking to someone else about things shutting down. I think about my mom and aunt who can’t leave their rooms, the elderly, single people living alone—they have it much worse. At least I can do dishes on my own or go in my backyard.   I hope this is a big wake up call for all of us. We need to understand what’s superficial and what’s important in life. We’re all in this together.   I just want to be around positive energy these days. Negativity is draining. If you’re smiling and laughing, you get through life so much better.   How do you feel about SaverLife?  It’s a nice incentive. Getting little deposits here and there helps when you are struggling. Every bit helps. "}
{"prompt":"Tax refunds are used for bills, healthcare, and – yes – having some fun!","completion":"Last month, we talked about  how Savers used their 2017 tax refunds . This month, we’re diving deeper into how saving and spending changed after Savers got their refunds.  Refunds are used to play catch-up  In the months leading up to tax season, many people have to put off bills or delay healthcare. We learned that Savers used their refunds to cover those delayed expenses, like medical bills, government expenses (like renewing a DMV license or paying a parking ticket), credit card payments, and utilities.  Here’s how people’s spending changed in February (after receiving tax refunds) compared to the prior three months.   One Saver named Sanjay told us that his tax refund “helped me clear a major chunk of my credit card debt.”  Refunds allow people to enjoy some well-earned fun  Savers also used their refunds to have fun! For some, this was going to the movies or a museum; for others, this was investing in their health with a gym membership.   It’s important to put some of your money toward things that you enjoy and that are meaningful to you. And even though discretionary spending increased in February, it still accounts for only around 1% of spending.  People are also saving their refunds!  People who received a tax refund in February increased the amount of money they transferred to a savings account by 191%.  On average, this comes out to $1,296 saved per person, meaning that people are saving almost  half  of their refunds. Way to go, Savers! "}
{"prompt":"Aaliyah’s Story: A Pharmacy Technician in the Making","completion":" Meet Aaliyah, a single mother of three who’s studying to become a pharmacy technician and nail technician and lives in North Carolina.  How do you like living in Raleigh?  I’ve been back here for about four years. I’m originally from Portsmouth, Virginia.   I moved to Raleigh when I was little, then I went to Virginia because I had friends down there. I found my way back to North Carolina when my family moved back. I just wanted to be closer to family.   Right now, it’s just me and my three children. They’re five months, seven, and eight.  What’s your profession?  I’m going to school to become a pharmacy technician. I also want to be a nail technician, so I’m going to school for both. My classes are all online, but I haven’t registered for fall classes just yet.  Are you working outside of going to school?  I’m employed with Etic Labor, and I do temporary work, housekeeping, warehouse work—things like that. The job I’m doing isn’t a career-building job; it’s just a job to make money.  How is your family coping with what’s going on?  Since the lockdowns started, I’m pretty much at home with the kids either cooking or cleaning. I keep them in the house, away from the virus.   My daughter likes karaoke and watching TikTok videos, and my son is into playing PlayStation games.   How are your kids going to be attending school in the fall?  I’m a little bit nervous that my kids are going to be going to school from home. I’m not too good at teaching. I don’t feel like I’m patient enough to do it, but I feel like it’s the safer thing to do, away from other kids. The kids at school aren’t washing their hands as much as they need to.  Neither my daughter or son are happy about the situation. They don’t understand why they can’t physically go back to school. My daughter is missing her friends and her teacher. I think this is going to become the new normal because of this virus.  What would you like to do after this is all over?  I’m taking my kids on a vacation because I know they’re tired of being cooped up in the house all day. Though it’s hard to say right now where we’d go. It’s hard to plan future trips when you don’t know how things are going to be after all this.  Are you saving for anything in the long-term?  I want to start my own nail tech business. Also, I’m looking to buy a home and I want somewhere stable for my kids to be—somewhere they can call their own. I’ve been looking at homes in North Carolina since it’s so close to family.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  Yes, a lot more than usual. I have a real hard time saving. And even when I save, I find something to spend the money on. I think about all the times I should’ve saved but spent money on unnecessary things like clothes, nails, lashes, or wigs.  What does saving mean to you in your life?  It means saving in case a rainy day comes. But you should save anyway because that’s the better thing to do. With me, I have kids, and I want to be prepared for anything that comes our way. "}

{"prompt":"JoTerrica’s Story: Veteran, Student, and Mother","completion":" Meet JoTerrica, a disabled veteran who is working on her Master’s in Social Work. She lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico with her children and partner.  What do you do?  I am a full-time student, I am a mother, and I am a Recreation Aide at my local VA. I served in the military from 2005 until March 2015. When I was 17 and a junior in high school, I started off as an enlisted soldier. In 2011 I graduated from the US Military Academy as a Second Lieutenant with a Bachelor’s in Management with a Systems Engineering track.  I’m working on a Master’s in Social Work and am on track to graduate December 2020. I can’t wait, I’m so excited. I want to work with other military members, both current and veterans, either on my base or at the VA.   My partner is also a disabled veteran who is an entrepreneur in the Information Technology field. He is looking into going back to school or into the civilian sector.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  Not much. When I enlisted, that was my first job and where I got my first paycheck. I learned how to file taxes using the many online resources available. At the US Military Academy, I learned about saving because we as cadets had an automatic savings account created once we became enrolled.  In our junior year, we get what’s called a “Cow Loan,” which is a Career Starter Loan– a loan to help cadets get started in life upon graduation. A lot of cadets buy a car. I purchased a car and opened an IRA account and a personal savings account and helped my family with the family trucking business.  Now that I’m a mom of three, all my kids have their own savings account and a college fund. If anything happens, they’ll have funds. My oldest child is even able to access her account so that if there’s an emergency, she can take care of the issue.  I bank with Navy Federal, and when I lived in Tennessee, I lived near a bank branch that had the capability of depositing change directly into one’s account. I liked this and I would take my oldest every couple weeks to deposit any spare change she had collected directly into her savings.  What’s your lowest financial point?  I am currently at my lowest financial point in life. This past year, I left my job to go back to school. My family and I are living off my disability income and my income from my position as a Recreation Aide and we are making it work. Things are tight and I had to take out a loan against my vehicle, but I was able to pay it back.  What’s your highest financial point?  My time in the military. I was paid two times a month and I didn’t have to worry about paying bills or putting food on my family’s table. Also, my most recent employment after the military these past few years. I purchased my first home that will be my forever home.  So really, this past year has been both my highest and lowest point financially.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  When I was leaving the military, my counselor found out I was going to be a government employee. He suggested I invest in the thrift savings plan (TSP) at the highest amount. My employer matched my monthly contributions. It helped that it was an automatic withdrawal, so I did not see the money or worry about it coming out of my account.  What are your goals for the future?  I want to enjoy each day and make sure my family has enough financial security to ensure we have a roof over our head and food on the table.   What does money mean to you in your life?  To me, money is the way to get the expensive things in life if you want it. I live a very frugal life, but if I want to do something big, I need to save and plan.  What financial advice you would give others?  Start saving! If you have children, open a savings account for them and put in a few dollars, even just $5 dollars. Slowly increase it so you have financial security no matter what happens. "}
{"prompt":"Relying on Credit Cards to Get Through the COVID-19 Pandemic","completion":" In 2020, SaverLife members have been withdrawing money from their savings more often than they did in 2019. And compared to last year, people are relying more on credit cards to feed their families. For people living in households earning less than $50,000 a year, credit card balances have increased by 38% from last year.  During these difficult times, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion are offering  FREE weekly credit reports  until  April 2021 . And if you’re wondering how to create a family-friendly budget during the COVID-19 pandemic, SaverLife CFP Tania Brown has some  tips just for you .    Credit card debt   A third of SaverLife members are also reporting an increase in credit card balances. If you’re struggling to save money while you’re in debt, here’s  how to start an emergency fund .  “I’m also on the Food Share Program, which has helped a bit. At this point, everything is month to month, and I pay down whatever I can come up with. On top of all that,  I can’t afford to pay my credit cards off . I have three liens against me.  It costs $2,500 to file for bankruptcy, and I can’t even afford to do that. ” – Michelle , SaverLife member "}
{"prompt":"Catching Up With Derkisha, Our 2019 Story Contest Winner","completion":" “ When I think about the future, I feel strong and empowered. “  We recently had the opportunity to catch up with  Derkisha , our 2019 $5,000 Tax Time Grand Prize Winner. She had some big news to share! Here’s what she had to say:  When I think about the future, I feel strong and empowered. It wasn’t always this way though. I found myself feeling alone and overwhelmed throughout my life as a young single mom, like the weight of the world was on my shoulders. Before I went back to school, there were times when I felt like I didn’t have any worth. I didn’t really have an identity, but being a student, I saw myself in a different light. It’s been so helpful for me feeling like I can do whatever I set my mind to. I’m so proud of myself for believing in my abilities.  I’d like to think my children will be inspired to go to college because they saw me going to college.  Going back to college as a single parent in my 30s wasn’t always easy, especially as a non-traditional student ( Chemistry almost took me out! ). I thought I was going to lose my mind because here was this opportunity, and because of the COVID-19 lockdowns, now I had to decide whether I could keep going or stop because I had no way to make sure my children were taken care of.  I knew I had to put on a brave face for my children, who were also struggling with this huge shift in all of our lives, but there’s nothing like knowing you can’t survive without school to keep you in school . My big kids really stepped up in helping me around the house and caring for their younger siblings. The support of all my family and friends made a big difference, too. I’m extremely grateful for my friends at SaverLife and will never forget the blessing I received through their support.   I can’t even describe what earning my degree means to me. I know it’s just an Associate’s degree, but  this degree means that I can go out and continue to change the circumstances of my family . It means I can continue in my schooling, get a higher education degree, and become a better, productive person of society. I want to be able to take care of my needs and without having to rely on others to help me.   My next steps are to attend Texas A&M University of Commerce, complete my prerequisites, take the TEAS, and apply to their nursing program.  For me, being a nurse is more than a paycheck — it’s a calling and a passion . Passion is the energy that keeps us going, that keeps us filled with meaning, and happiness, and excitement, and anticipation. Passion is a powerful force in accomplishing anything you set your mind to, and in experiencing work and life to the fullest extent possible. Ultimately, passion is the driving force behind success and happiness that allows us all to live better lives, and all those things are truly all the things I desire for myself and my children: a happy, meaningful, exciting and successful life. As Harriet Tubman once so simply, but profoundly, put it, “Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.”  "}

{"prompt":"Celebrating 500,000 SaverLife Members: Our Chief Impact Officer’s Letter to You","completion":" When I joined SaverLife in 2017, we had 30,000 members. When our CEO, Leigh, told me that her goal was to reach 1 million members by 2022, I felt hesitant.  Can SaverLife really reach one million people ?   Four years later, we’re well on our way.   This month, we are celebrating the huge milestone of reaching  500,000 members  across the country. Our growth has come from a relentless pursuit of a single goal: helping people save. We do this not by pushing our preconceived notions on people, but by designing products that meet people where they are.   In the past four years, we have transformed our platform from a matched-savings program reaching 6,000 San Francisco residents to a prize-linked savings program that reaches half a million people across the country. As our President and CEO, Leigh, said before going on parental leave last month, “In the last 12 months, we’ve grown our membership by nearly 300%. If there was ever a proof point that showed the value of what we do, that [is it].”  As we look to the future, we’re focused on personalizing the savings experience on our platform to reach even more people. We will continue using technology to have an impact at scale. Here’s to the next 500,000 SaverLife members.   David Chief Impact Officer, SaverLife "}
{"prompt":"Margaret and Tom’s Story: Giving All They Can During the Coronavirus Lockdown","completion":" Meet Margaret and Tom, East Coast natives who live in Connecticut.    What do you both do for work?  Margaret : I’ve been a United Way food pantry manager for the past 14 years. Normally, I order food for pickup, help people shop, and take inventory. It’s only open certain times a day to limit the foot traffic. My boss helps keep track of the stats for who’s coming in: age, race, and gender. We used to get a lot of kids coming through, but now those kids are grown up. These days, we’re getting a lot of people in the 45-80 age group.  Before this job, I worked at phone company for 20 years. When I finished my time at the phone company, I spent a year trying to find something to do. For nine months, I was searching for a job. Then, I ended up getting a job at the food pantry. I’ve been here ever since.  My husband, Tom, is on disability, and he worked part-time until last year. He worked at a temporary transitional housing program, where he worked with tenants’ case managers on finding appropriate housing, helping them go shopping for groceries, and making sure they followed the program’s rules. Tom also did a great job in helping raise our son.  What does a day in your lives currently look like?   Margaret : Tom and I spend a lot of time together once I’m off from work. We didn’t have the empty nester syndrome when our son moved last May because he only moved a mile away from us. In addition to working as a police dispatcher, he’s an EMT. We haven’t been going out as much. I tell people, “We’ll have the best-looking yard when all of this is done.”  Tom : I worked in the yard, clean the house, and go on social media. We enjoy being home and taking care of the home. When our son moved out, our utilities bill decreased by 40%. Our water and gas company even called to ask if anything was wrong with our meter, which is funny because they never called when the bill was higher than average! Our son’s moving out made a difference in our bills over the last nine months.  What does budgeting look like for you two these days?  Tom : We’ve learned to go through all the groceries we have before going out again as well as pinch pennies more often.  Margaret : We have a jar of babysitting money that we save for a rainy day. It’s there if something small comes up. Tom is also saving a penny a day this year. We want to take a three-day trip somewhere. We haven’t gone away for a vacation in 34 years. It would be really nice to either go to Niagara Falls or Acadia National Park, Maine.   What do you envision for your family’s future?  Margaret : We’re trying to stay focusing on saving up for our trip. Tom’s never been to Niagara Falls, and I thought that it would be something nice to do. I haven’t been there since I was a teenager in my high school’s 4-H program.   We had to file for bankruptcy four years ago because of medical bills. Ever since then, we focused on paying down what we owe.    Tom : The Quicken Loan people we work with are very nice. We pay over the phone. They work with us to figure out what we’re able to pay each month.   How do you feel about the shelter-in-place mandate?  Margaret : It’s weird. There’s a hill we typically drive on that’s usually so busy you can see the traffic for two miles down the road. These days, you almost forget you’re driving on that same road because no one is around you. At the food pantry that I help manage, we have a shelter connected to our building. We have businesses all around us making food for the community. Then it’s posted on Facebook and other social media. We also try to do take out once a week to support local businesses. I’m still able to work, so I’m grateful for that.  It’s scary to think of New York, where the number of people dying from the coronavirus is staggering.  Tom : It’s like fighting an invisible enemy. At this point, I’m worried a lot about the economy. It’s not like the New Deal where jobs were made. Nowadays, people have jobs, but they just can’t go back to them. I also worry about my wife going to work and getting exposed to the coronavirus. Her job is right next to a homeless shelter, and I don’t know where those individuals go all day.  How do your finances look these days?  Margaret : We’re saving what we can. Surprisingly, the gas in our car lasted us two weeks. Though it makes sense because we’re not going out as much. Normally, I’d go to my mom’s once a week. But she’s 89-years old, and all of our jobs (my son’s and mine) include dealing with the public. She doesn’t really understand, and we have to keep explaining to her, “We don’t want to get you sick.”   How do you feel about SaverLife?  Margaret : I read on your site how important it is to pay yourself first. Now we do that, and we’re able to stay on top of things.  "}
{"prompt":"Kimberly’s Story: Securing a Future for her Kids","completion":" Meet Kimberly, a car assembly plant employee who lives with her four children (and fur child) in Ohio.   What’s it like where you live?  I’ve lived in Cincinnati for about 22 years now, but I’m originally from Kansas City, Missouri. The weather is weird, but other than that we live a pretty typical suburban life. In my house, it’s my four kids, me, and our cat.  Can you tell me a little bit about your profession?  For the past two and a half years, I’ve worked on an assembly line making car parts such as alternators. I like it’s because it’s something different. Before this job, I had customer service roles. I made the change to my current job right after I had my son, and I’ve been here ever since.  How’s your work schedule?  We have rotating schedules, which is different compared to many other jobs. It changes every three to four weeks. Right now, I work the 4pm – 2:30am shift. Sometimes, I’ll have to make lunch and dinner for my kids before I leave to go to work for the evening.  What does a day in your life currently look like?   By the time I wake up in the morning, my youngest is already wide awake and ready to say, “Hey world!” An hour or two later, my other kids get up. I make lunch and dinner for them and put those meals in the fridge. We play outside for a while so they can get all their energy out.   After work, I get home around 3 am. By that time, my son is still awake. Actually, three out of my four kids are awake. Around 4 – 4:40am is when they finally go to sleep. It’s rough, but it’s my life.   In your June Journaling post, you mentioned that your savings were drained due to reduced hours and you had to really budget. Could you tell me more about that?  So with my savings drained, we had to live almost paycheck to paycheck again. When we go grocery shopping, if we don’t need it, we don’t get it. I write everything down and then cross it off the list to make sure we get what we need and don’t spend more than we need to. The Kroger’s app is really helpful because it helps me keep track of how much I’m spending at the store. In addition to using that grocery shopping app, we use a lot of coupons or wait until items are on sale. I also don’t buy anything full price.  How are you feeling about your situation right now?  To be honest, I’m very overwhelmed. It’s a lot for me and my children.   My oldest daughter, who’s ten years old, is a social butterfly, and she misses her friends and cheerleading. And my youngest daughter has special needs, so she doesn’t understand what’s going on. We have a huge yard, which I’m grateful for, and I try to do my best to keep them happy.   My son loves playing in water, and my other daughter loves chalk and bubbles. Altogether, they all just love being outside.   What would you like to do after this is all over?  I want to go on a family vacation with all five of us. Maybe I’ll take them to the beach or something. I never really went on a vacation with them, so that would be nice.  What are you saving for?  Our future, honestly. I’m saving for a future for my kids. With my daughter being special needs, I don’t know what the future is going to hold for her, but I just want to make sure she’s secure.  In the short-term, I want to save up for a house. Right now, I’m just working on building my credit.  What does money mean to you right now?  It means being able to live. Even though we’re in a pandemic, the bills didn’t stop—nothing stopped. I wanted to make sure we had everything we needed: a roof over our heads, diapers, clothes, and food. As bad as it is, money rules the world.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I never heard about it until a few months ago, but I was so grateful to find you guys. I read the  Money 101  articles, and they’re so informative. Also, SaverLife introduced me to TrustPlus financial coaching and that was really helpful. You guys helped me out with my savings. I actually told my friends about the program, too. "}
{"prompt":"Paige’s Story: A School Counselor in the Making","completion":" Meet Paige, a full-time graduate student who lives with her family in Enfield, Connecticut.   What are you studying in graduate school?  My concentration is in school counseling and I’m super excited to finally graduate this May. After I earn my Master’s, I either want to work in either a Connecticut- or Massachusetts-based school district.  Walk me through a day in your life.   Right now, everything from my classes to my internship is virtual. It was tough to adjust to at first, but now I think I have it all figured out.   On a typical day, I wake up, work out, hop on Microsoft Teams to meet with my students and supervisors from 8am-3pm, then I have a break until my evening class, which is from 4-6:30pm. Some days I have to physically go into work, too.  What kind of work do you do in-person?  I’m a nanny and I help out a local family. Additionally, I’m also a behavior technician and help kids who have autism. When I’m not busy with either of those two jobs, I work at the local YMCA. We’re not doing much at the center these days with COVID-19 precautions and all that.  What does paying your student loans look like right now?  I have both private and federal loans. For the latter, the interest is still at 0%, which I’m really grateful for. However, I still have to make payments on my private student loans. Since I’m a full-time student, I only have to pay the interest on my private student loans.  When COVID-19 restrictions caused businesses to shut down, I couldn’t work and needed help paying my student loans. My mom would help me out every once in a while. I’ll be honest, I’m nervous about what my payment plan is going to look like when I’ll be required to pay both my private and federal student loans at the same time.   Did you receive either stimulus check last year?  I didn’t receive the $1,200 or $600 stimulus checks because my mom still claims me as a dependent. I really wish I did receive them though because it’s not like I don’t also have bills to pay.   You won $250 from our Savings Boost challenge  last year. What was your reaction to winning and how did you use the cash prize?  I used the money to pay off some of my student loans! Obviously, I was very grateful and shocked when I got an email saying that I won a cash prize. It just so happened that I was checking my inbox before work one day and opened that email in particular. I was so excited that I immediately called my mom and shared the good news with her. It was the first time I had won something from SaverLife.  What does budgeting and saving look like for you this year?  I actually started a savings challenge this past January 2021. I took a deck of 52 cards and wrote $1 – $52 on each of them. Once a week, I pull a random card and that’s what I save that week. I even got my mom to join! So that’s what I’ve been doing to help me stay motivated to save.  Overall, I’m also trying to increase my savings so I can be a bit more prepared to pay off my student loans when my repayment plan starts up again.  And as far as budgeting, I use Google Sheets to help me track my income, fixed expenses like bills, and varying expenses like dining out and shopping. It’s great because the Google Sheet automatically calculates how much money I have leftover after I’m done inputting my expenses for the month.   What would you like to do when things get better?  I’m honestly just looking forward to being able to hang out with all of my friends again. I miss them so much. It’s tough because we’re all living in different places now that we’re out of college.   Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  I did a little bit, but I was also able to qualify for unemployment. Once I found out through my job that I was able to apply for unemployment, the process was pretty easy.  Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  I’d definitely say paying off my car last July has been my biggest achievement to date. My car was my first “big girl purchase.” When I signed the loan paperwork, I was on a six-year repayment plan. But I was able to pay off my car in four years instead.   How’d you find out about SaverLife?  I discovered SaverLife through a financial planning program through The Village of Children and Family. During a regular meeting, I received a flyer about the ALICE Saves program and signed up from there.  I love the SaverLife website and the different  savings challenges . I just noticed that SaverLife added  savings levels and badges  as well. Those are really motivating and remind me of my Apple Watch, where you can earn a badge if you meet all of your goals. "}
{"prompt":"Gabriel’s Story: Freelancing His Way to Financial Security","completion":" Meet Gabriel, a freelancer and college student who’s living with his family in Alabama until his college campus reopens for in-person classes.  What are you studying at college?  I’m entering my sophomore year at college, studying engineering at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. I personally call it the “Canada” of Alabama due to the colder winter weather and our signature sport: hockey. The school is very technology focused. It has the most engineers as well as ties to the space race.   What does a day in your life look like right now?   My day is mostly centered around freelancing. The first thing I do is look at my emails; I need to be caught up with them on the daily. Then, I’ll check my social media accounts, especially LinkedIn and Instagram. After, I’ll check out postings on UpWork—that’s where I get the most clients for my freelancing job. Recently, I’ve worked with different companies from real estate to small mom and pop shops to political campaigns.   Could you tell me more about your family?  I’m a first-generation American. My dad came from Venezuela and worked hard to get me where I am today. I want to be able to continue working hard like he did. Like most people, I want to make my dad proud.   What’s it like to live legally blind in your town?  Right now, I’m living with my parents in a small town called Tarrant, Alabama. It’s next to Birmingham, which is the closest big city. The downtown area is accessible by car, and there’s only one bus route to downtown and back. The thing is, it’s scheduled for 5am four days a week, so it’s not easy for someone like me who’s legally blind to schedule my day around using public transportation. I have to plan out whole days if I’m going out. It’s definitely a process.   Huntsville isn’t a mecca when it comes to public transportation. On Fridays, I can go get my groceries and make a trip to the mall as well as my university, but that’s about it. When I get my degree and my first post-college job, I want to live in a place where I have access to good public transportation.  It’s no secret that Uber is expensive, and on top of that, we don’t have the Uber pool option here. In fact, it’s twice as expensive where I live. For example, from Tarrant to inner city Birmingham, it’s $15. And that’s just one way. I used to use Uber twice a week to get to work and back. So that was $30 for transportation right off the bat.  One time when I was 17, I was planning a trip to see my girlfriend who lives in Tennessee. I knew I needed to save up for that trip, so that’s when I started freelancing. It was then that I realized I could make money and work remotely as well.  Tell me more about your experience with freelancing.   I’m a software developer. That’s my main position. I help people build websites. Also, I translate documents from English to Spanish and vice versa, and do some voice acting as well. I realized that all I needed was a laptop, good internet connection, and grit. Freelancing has made me understand that being your own boss is a hassle, but the freedom you get from freelancing is worth the cost.   It wasn’t easy at first. I wondered, “How will people want me as a client? How will I stand out?” I somehow managed to do it and eventually build a whole client base. With the money I earn from freelancing, I’m trying to pay for college. The great thing about being a freelancer is the work experience that I’m gaining. It’s great to have on a resume in addition to part-time jobs and internships.   I will say that the one downside of freelance work is the taxes! They’re way different compared to the taxes that people with regular, full-time jobs have to fill out. That being said, I’m glad the  IRS offers Free File  for those who make $65K or below. That’s come in handy. In my community, we also have this organization called United Way that helps people file their taxes.     In addition to participating in SaverLife’s savings program, Gabriel received a grant through the SaverLife  Emergency Response Fund .  Could you tell me more about your financial situation?  I talk to people about how to build credit. My mom told me not to pick up a credit card, but I believe that if you know how to use them correctly, they can work in your favor. And if you know how to play by the rules, you’ll get ahead. Money shouldn’t be a taboo thing to talk about.   I also believe that if you have grit, merit, and you’re willing to work hard, you deserve to go to college. Sometimes I feel like an outlier. I’m legally blind, but the reason I get to study computer science is because I’ve been blessed with scholarships. Other people should have that opportunity as well.   What are you saving for right now?  Besides saving up to pay for college, I’d really like to buy a house. The homes in my immediate area go for about $10,000, but the neighborhood isn’t that good. That’s why I’m looking to move to Huntsville, where my college is located. The going rate for homes is about $100,000, but if I figured if I can muster $27,000 a year for school, I could afford a home one day. It also doesn’t hurt that there are so many nice people in Huntsville. I would consider buying a home a personal achievement because I’ll know how hard I worked to get there.   Has COVID-19 impacted you?  I would say so. From a social perspective, Venezuelan people are known to be fantastic party goers and social butterflies. Not being able to be as outgoing has really been a bummer. Everyone is on WhatsUp messaging each other things like, “I miss you guys.” Going out to eat or making a trip downtown to grab coffee—all the small luxuries of life are gone.   When it came to my academics, it was definitely a culture shock. Online classes work in my favor, but it’s a hit or miss when it comes to the professors teaching the class. With the transition to online classes, it’s made a lot of students rethink, “Maybe college shouldn’t cost $27K in the fall.”   What would you like to do after COVID-19 has passed?  Truth be told, I can’t wait to get back to my college campus in the fall. I really do miss my friends and our late night trips to Waffle House.   Have you picked up any new hobbies recently?  Actually, I’ve been getting into cooking. I’ve gotta up my cooking game. That’s what’s pushed me to discover healthier dishes. Recently, I cooked grilled chicken with tomatoes and zucchini. The last couple of dishes I’ve made were definitely not like the usual college diet.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I feel like SaverLife is a one-of-a-kind organization. As somebody who relies on assistance for things, I’ve run into organizations that talk more about what they do than actually doing anything. I’m glad that SaverLife actually commits to doing what it set out to do.  I found SaverLife through the Steady app. My first thought was, “This is fantastic!”  I really like that you have a platform for people to share their  stories  and  experiences with money . I like that people can collectively talk about things like taxes and building wealth. It’s great that you all are helping people with managing their money.   Do you have anything else you’d like to add?  I’ll be honest, jumping into freelancing at 17 was a blind leap of faith (pun intended), but I have no regrets in doing it. It’s taught me a lot of valuable skills that I hope to use once I graduate college. I encourage the SaverLife community to look into it as a potential option for taking control of their financial future.    "}
{"prompt":"Do ups and downs in income make it hard for you to save?","completion":"Last month , our research showed that 70% of SaverLife Savers experience ups and downs in income. These fluctuations can make it harder to budget and save. After all, how can you plan for your financial goals when you don’t know how your income will change every month?  We were shocked to learn how frequent and how intense these monthly income changes are for our Savers.  The typical Saver experiences income volatility 3 out of every 4 months.  On average, this works out to a whopping 9 months of the year when your income is at least 25% higher or lower than your average income.  Income swings are significant and frequent  Contrary to what many people think, income volatility can also involve spikes in income. In fact, over half of volatility events are increases in income. The median monthly dip is $1,208 and the median monthly spike is $1,346.   Even in months when Savers have more income to work with, they tell us that it may still be difficult to save. They’re still juggling income and expenses, and they sometimes have to catch up on bills and other expenses that they’ve put off during months of lower income.  Joey, a Saver from California, told us, “The income ups and downs have a huge impact. I have to watch everything I buy and be extremely frugal. Medical expenses are pretty big; because of the ACA I’m able to see basic doctors, but I have to pay for specialists out of pocket.” "}
{"prompt":"Thank You.","completion":" This has been the most challenging year. SaverLife strives to help families prepare for financial emergencies, but we never imagined a crisis of the magnitude or reach of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope the health crisis will decrease in the spring, but the economic consequences will be long lasting.   The impact on SaverLife members has been especially devastating.  Our latest research  found that 73% of you are unemployed or have lost hours at work as a result of the pandemic. Credit card balances are 56% higher than the same time period last year, and grocery store spending remains elevated. Saving money has never been more difficult.   One thing that has stayed constant in these difficult times is the resilience of SaverLife members—all 460,000 of you. SaverLife has always been a savings platform, but this is the year it truly became a community—because of you. From words of encouragement in the forums, to strangers sharing SaverLife resources on Facebook, SaverLife members are supporting each other like never before.   In 2020, we were honored to share the stories of people like  Heather , a hospice nurse recovering from an unexpected layoff, and  Monica , a mother who struggled to save money after her rent was increased, but still found a way to give back to her neighborhood. Your stories of hope and resilience are the reason we come to work every day, and we will keep fighting for you.   As we look to 2021, I remain committed to advocating for you and providing help whenever we can. Until then, thank you for all you bring to our community and know that, no matter what your circumstances, you are not alone.  "}
{"prompt":"Sherell’s Story: Overachieving on Saving","completion":" Meet Sherell, a born and raised Delaware native and mother of two teenage sons.    What do you do?  I just finished working at UPS because of health issues. I’m not working at the moment, but I’m currently looking for more work. I think the next move might be to something in the customer service field. I’m good in that department. Warehouse work really took a toll on me—especially on my back. Especially not working at the moment, I’ve had to tap into some reserves.   What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My upbringing taught me how to save. I found that it’s hard to save for things that you need, not want. I was also taught to keep up with the bills.   Do you have any financial lessons you’d like to pass onto your sons?  My oldest boy just started working. We’re working on budgeting. I taught him to take $5-$10 out of every paycheck and save it for his future. Who knows? He may want to get his own apartment or car soon. My oldest just got money for Christmas. He doesn’t want to spend it.  My youngest boy also has his own account. He has a bank in his room that he keeps his money in.   Did you reach a financial goal you set for yourself this year?  This year I reached $2,500 in my savings, which I’ve never done before. That was a goal for me because I wanted to save money. My original goal was $1,500 and I overdid it. With tax time coming up, I plan on saving even more because I want to get a new house.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  My father always told me “don’t think twice about saving. Just take your money and put it in your savings account.” I still follow this today. If I think about it too long, then it’s an issue. Normally, what I do is take it out of my savings account, so I don’t have to worry or be tempted to withdraw it later. That way it’s easier for me to save.  What are your goals for the future?  I would say to get a car because I don’t have one right now. I’m looking to buy one used to drive my son around. Of course, there are buses around, but when it gets cold, it’s a drag not having a car.   What does money mean to you in your life?  Money, to me, means supplying my needs. "}

{"prompt":"How Voting Affects Your Financial Future","completion":" SaverLife’s mission is to create prosperity by helping you save and invest in your future. As you start to build your savings, it’s important to acknowledge that there are policies, laws, and other systemic barriers that impact your financial security.  That’s why we were excited to learn that  85%  of SaverLife members plan to vote this November.     Voting is one of the most important ways you can influence those policies and laws that affect your financial future. How you vote helps determine who represents your interests in government and how they will support policies that make it harder or easier for you and your family to get by — and reach your dreams.  In fact, you could say that voting is a critical part of saving for your future.  We believe it’s important to vote, both in national elections (like the presidential election in November) as well as those in your town and state. The decisions you make and the leaders you elect have an impact on your life, so creating the future you want begins with a vote.  But if you’re new to the process, you haven’t voted in a while, you’ve moved, or your circumstances have changed, you may not know exactly how to cast your vote in the next election. And that’s okay. We’re all in this together to navigate the challenge of voting safely during a pandemic.  To get you started, we’ve created resources for you to draw upon to make your vote count.

{"prompt":"Ramona’s Story: Fostering Change in Her Community","completion":" Meet Ramona, a full-time small business owner who lives in South Bronx, New York.   Tell me about yourself.   I’m a first-generation graduate with a Master’s degree. Right now, it’s just myself and my pets and we live in public housing. I’ve been living in public housing for four and a half years now.   When the $1,200 federal stimulus came in last year, it really helped. The additional money I received from self-employed unemployment also helped me establish my savings, which I haven’t been able to in years.   How did  Ojala  start and what are your goals for your company?   Prior to my nephew being born, I had spent ten years living in Hawaii, connecting with my indigenous background. I fully immersed myself in the Hawaiian culture and the symbolism. When I was living in Hawaii, I bought him these unique tops with culturally inspired drawings and sayings.   One day, I was changing him when I realized that all his clothes looked the same. I remember Googling “onesies for Hispanic babies,” but was so appalled when I saw a onesie that read “Bad Hombre”—that was  not  okay. It was so inappropriate.   That’s when I got to talking when a Hawaiian friend of mine, Jim, about starting a clothing business for Hispanic culture inspired clothing. He’s still my mentor to this day. We started meeting once a month, and after nine months, the business was incorporated. In addition to making our brand culturally conscious, I also wanted to have our products be environmentally friendly.   All of our designs very boldly say, “I’m indigenous and I’m Hispanic.” I try to incorporate a sense of who we are as a community with every piece of clothing. When I see my babies wearing my designs, it’s almost a protest. There’s nothing bolder than putting on those clothes. ABC7 recently featured us for Hispanic Heritage Month, too.   Prior to starting my company, I had always worked in government. I already knew that there were a ton of resources out there to help me get started. I started working with different programs like Start Small, Think Big to help me get my vision off the ground. Start Small, Think Big is a mentorship program from Columbia University that partners with small businesses like mine. In addition to helping me create my brand, they helped me get a better picture of my current financial situation and set up Google ads for a few months.     I am a member of SaverLife, social entrepreneur and founder of  Ojala Threads Inc.  We design premium baby onesies inspired by indigenous Hispanic heritage. Our Sales Support advocacy work focused on criminal justice reform, public housing, and public transportation in the South Bronx. To learn more about our story and impact on our community visit  www.ojalathreads.com   Could you tell me more about the impact your business has on your community?  We have a huge social responsibility agenda. It’s so important to me that my company is an asset to my community. Where I live, more than 50% of the people live below the poverty level. 75% of the people that go to Rikers are from three neighborhoods in my city. The same way it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to lose them.   I’ve lived in public housing for the last five years, and my *grandmother’s been here as well for the last 29 years. When I moved back from Hawaii to New York, I wanted to be with my *grandmother and spend her golden years with her.   To me, this is one of the last places you can thrive. While your rent is 30% of your income, the living conditions are deplorable. For example, the elevators have been out 80% of time for the last two months. Public housing is being threatened where I live, and Ojala is trying to foster those necessary community conversations. We have meetings every week and facilitate conversations about the privatization of our public housing.   I’d love to have the Ojala staff to do community responsibility work. I love what I’ve created, but I think once the designs are made, eventually I want people to take on some of the responsibilities. All my jobs have been related to outreach and community development.   Ojala has redefined what success means to me. I don’t know if I could do what I do if I didn’t feel the responsibility to do it.   How have your sales been like during the COVID-19 pandemic?   It’s really been a struggle these last couple of months. 80% of our sales used to come in through pop-up shops, but since March we’ve had to pivot and turn our in-person shops into an online platform. It’s an investment to host a website. I have an intern who helps with graphics and expanding the catalog, but it’s still a lot of work. We got $50 in sales last August, and in September and October, we got about $70 in sales. If it weren’t for the grants to keep us afloat, we wouldn’t be able to go on.   How do you feel about SaverLife?   I found out about SaverLife when I received an Emergency Response Fund grant last spring. When I received that money, I was able to use it to pay down my credit card debt.   Also, the financial coach I met through SaverLife told me about Disability Discharge, which really helped me with my student loans.   *After we interviewed Ramona last year, her grandmother passed away shortly after on December 29, 2020 due to complications associated with COVID-19. Ramona and her family are in our thoughts and this Saver Story is dedicated to her grandmother.  "}

{"prompt":"Nastassia’s Story: I See Brightness in My Future","completion":" Meet Nastassia, a mother of five and an immigrant from Jamaica who has been living in New York since 2009.  What do you do?  Right now I’m not working. I had an injury when I was pregnant with my last child, so I’m at home. My fiancé just started at a new job at a warehouse.  I was injured at a store near my home. The injury makes my life so much more difficult. I go to physical therapy, but it’s still an issue. It’s not getting worse, but it’s not getting better either. I’m not able to do a lot of things because of the pain.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I’ve always been the person who saves. Especially coming from Jamaica, things are so different. There is so little opportunity there and so little resources.  When I got money from my parents for lunch at school, I would often save it. There would be weeks at a time when I didn’t have lunch. But I had great friends who shared their lunch with me because they knew what I was saving for. I didn’t tell my family I was saving my lunch money because I didn’t want them to worry about me. I wanted to be able to buy the things that I needed without asking them.  What’s your highest financial point?  The highest was when it was just me and my kids in Florida. We had better credit and it was more comfortable. When we were living in Florida, I had two jobs to make sure I could give my kids a good life. I never want them to see me struggle or suffer.  What’s your lowest financial point?  Before my fiancé got a job was the lowest point. It’s still a challenging time because we’re struggling with rent and bills.  It’s always been up and down. I want a future where we don’t have to struggle so much.  I am just trying to stay positive. I have to be positive for my kids. If anything were to happen, it would be fine as long as I was still around. If I had to have three jobs to support my kids, I would.  What are your goals for the future?  I see brightness in my future, if I keep saving. Some people want flashy things. And that’s not me. I’m not the kind of person who wants to buy this or that and show off to the world.  I want my kids to continue in school obviously. They’re good right now. Even though they’re young, they’re smart. I want to keep them on that path. I also don’t want to force school on them. I don’t want to be that parent. My oldest says he wants to be a marine biologist because he’s really into animals. I hope he stays on this path. My other two oldest kids keep switching what they want from the future.  Whatever they decide they want to do, I’ll stick by their side.   What does money mean to you in your life?  It’ll be good to have a substantial amount, but I’m not money-hungry. I’m not that person. At the end of the day, if you die, you can’t take it with you. But it does make your life a little bit better.  If you’re money-hungry, you’ll push everything important aside. People will be in your life because you have money, but not for you. "}
{"prompt":"Omar’s Story: Establishing Credit is the Foundation of Wealth","completion":" Meet Omar, a full-time college student living in San Francisco, CA with his parents and 21-year old son.  What do you do?  I’m studying behavioral science and addiction counseling at the City College of San Francisco. I want to be a part of the solution of dealing with all the pain that’s in the world—or some of it anyway.  I also do temp work when I’m not in class.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My mom didn’t know about managing money, so she couldn’t really teach me about it. As I got older, just over the last year or two, I got a better understanding of credit and finances.  What’s your lowest/highest financial point?  My lowest point was when I was homeless and had nowhere to go and no job.  I’ve since raised my credit score and got approved for a credit card recently. I’ve been able to save and establish a dedicated savings account. I’m doing better at managing money overall.  Once I got educated about finances, it all made sense. I knew that this was what I was supposed to be doing. Before, I didn’t have any direction, but now I know a lot more. I’m still looking for a lot more knowledge on the subject. But at least I have a foundation that I’m building on.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Use your credit card only once a month, and for $20. That’s a piece of advice that I follow. Someone told me that, and I was surprised. But it’s true! Just because you have credit doesn’t mean you have to use it.  What would you tell your younger self about money?  Establish your credit! That’s the foundation of wealth in this country. Credit has a lot to do with how you stabilize yourself financially. Nowadays, you need credit for jobs and housing and everything.  You’re either going to get the prime rate or the subprime rate, and if you have bad credit, you’re essentially giving away thousands of dollars in interest.  What are your goals for the future?  Get my BA from City College of San Francisco and get employed in the field I’m studying.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It doesn’t have as much value as I thought. Now, I have a more realistic value of money. Because of that, I have more money. I’m able to save more; I don’t spend as much. I’m more conscious of things I buy because I have a bigger goal, and I know I can’t be spending crazy amounts if I want to reach my bigger goals.  What is the best thing you’ve ever bought with your money?  Probably paying off my debt! I actually just paid off some lingering debt, which was getting in my way of moving forward. How can you move forward if you’re still paying into your past?   How will you feel when you pay off all your debt?  It’ll be a relief! Instead of focusing on the big picture and getting overwhelmed; I’m breaking it down month by month. I’m paying down $25/month right now. And as I make more, I’ll be able to pay off more, but at least I’m making progress. "}

{"prompt":"Barbara’s Story: A Penny Found is a Penny Saved","completion":" Meet Barbara, a happy retired grandmother who lives in Eugene, Oregon.  What do you do?  Before I retired, I worked as a cashier and gas station attendant. I also volunteered a lot. I have five grandkids and they all live in Eugene. They’re 3, 5, 8, 9, and 11. There are two boys and three girls. I do a lot of babysitting – they keep my hands busy!  I’m also on disability, so I have to manage with what I can. During the summer, there are a lot of mouths to feed. I’ve been on disability since 2000, when I had my stroke.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My mother taught me that when we had a penny, give it to the church. I always learned that giving is important, but saving wasn’t something I learned as much. I didn’t learn that until I was in my 30s. But at that point, I had children and was living on minimum wage, which made it really hard to save.  I think it was the same for my mom, who worked two jobs. I remember her being really thrifty and resourceful.   What have been your lowest and highest financial points?  The lowest point was when I lost my job at Walmart. It only takes one paycheck, and I missed that paycheck. I still had my job at McDonald’s, but then I got a 30-day notice from my apartment. Between my husband and I, we had three jobs, but we still ended up on the street.  I divorced my husband so that I could stay in a shelter with my daughters. I’m still best friends with my husband, but you do what you have to do to make things work financially to get a roof over your heads.  We had 90 days in a shelter to find new housing. And then I was able to be back with my husband, but not legally married. That was 19 years ago. It was a hard time, an ugly time. Everything crashed all at once. My daughter was also very sick and in the ICU.  It makes you so strong, and I did everything I could to get out of that. It’s a humbling experience to know that you don’t have enough and that you can’t provide for your children. I think that’s the hard thing.  Now it is really rewarding to be with my grandchildren. We go to the library and to the park. We do a book program at the library together. I’m blessed that both of my daughters have homes and have done well for themselves.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  My dad always emphasized how every penny counts. Some people say, “find a penny, pick it up, and you’ll have good luck.” But he said, “Find a penny, pick it up, and save it.”  Some people say, “time is money,” but some of us have time and not money.  What would you tell your 18-year-old self about money?  Besides the fact that it doesn’t grow on trees? [Laughs] That it isn’t bad to pay yourself first. It’s self-care. It’s putting the air mask on yourself first. I didn’t learn that until my 40s.  How has your life changed in the past few years?  Since January, I’ve changed my lifestyle a lot. I’ve become a vegetarian again. I’ve changed from a size 20 to a size 4. So, I’ve been able to sell my old clothes at Buffalo Exchange. It’s also more economical! That’s what I’m finding out.  A program I volunteer with is Grassroots Garden. It allows me to be in the sunshine, and then I come home with a bag of vegetables! "}
{"prompt":"Ask an Expert episode 2 follow-up: Your Questions About the Second Stimulus Bill, Answered","completion":"    Earlier this month, we hosted a  Facebook Live  featuring our resident public policy expert,  Radha Seshagiri , and moderator/marketing intern,  Morgan Alford . Here are the questions Radha answered, as well as some helpful resources.   1. Am I eligible to get a stimulus check?  Here’s how to  check your eligibility You must: Be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident  Have a valid SSN (only one person in the family has to have an SSN) Not be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return Note that your 2018 or 2019 income is under $75,000 (single, or married filing separately) or $150,000 (married filing jointly) for the full amount Know that you can also qualify if you have no income  2. What do I do if I still haven’t received the second stimulus check?  Here’s what to know about the  timing of the second stimulus payment You should have received a stimulus payment by now. The payment will have already arrived via direct deposit or in the mail as check or debit card Don’t worry if you haven’t received it yet. Millions of eligible people still haven’t received one, due to errors made by the IRS   3. The IRS says my check was sent on January 6 but I’ve not received it. Is there a way to track it?  Check your payment status  on the official IRS website or call the IRS toll-free at (800) 919-9835 Double check with your bank to see if you’ve received a deposit  4. How can I get my second stimulus check without filing my taxes?  You need to file your taxes if you haven’t received your check and  claim the Recovery Rebate Credit Even if you don’t normally file taxes—either because you’re on SSI or SSDI or you’re retired or you don’t meet the IRS’ income threshold—it is a good idea to file your taxes this year  to claim any missing stimulus money Haven’t filed your taxes yet? Consider using  Free File from the IRS  5. “We were supposed to receive $600 for our 7 year old son, and we haven’t received it, but we did get $1200 total for Mom and Dad. We don’t make enough to file taxes, so we did the first stimulus through the Non Filers link. What do we do to get the missing stimulus?”  Double check your bank account; the IRS may have made a direct deposit into your account  You can still receive payment! The IRS made a lot of mistakes. Just make sure you file your taxes correctly to get the right amount and  claim the Recovery Rebate Credit The IRS has a trusted program,  Free File , that allows people to file their taxes for free Note that in order for your children to be eligible, they need to be under 17 years old and not have earned more than $4200  6. I owe child support. Does that mean I won’t get the stimulus?   You will still get your  second  stimulus check  even if you owe child support.  7. How will this affect my taxes? If we received both stimulus checks, do we claim them on 2021 taxes?   The second (and first) stimulus check is a credit —  not  taxable income. You will not owe taxes on the stimulus payments  However , you might owe taxes on any unemployment income you received You may also be eligible for additional funds through the  Earned Income Tax Credit  (EITC) This year, there is a special rule (called the “lookback rule”)  in place that allows you to get the most EITC that you can. When filing your taxes this year, you can use either your 2020 or 2019 income—whichever will give you the most money back in your tax refund.  Talk to a tax preparer  about this option, and keep your 2019 records available  Note: The IRS will start processing tax returns February 12 and the deadline to file your taxes is April 15  8. I made a mistake on my taxes and I need help to fix it. What do I do?   The IRS knows that mistakes happen Check the IRS website for more information on correcting your taxes, or  talk to a free tax preparer  for more help   9. “My husband is a retired disabled Vet, we haven’t received the second stimulus, we received the first one without filling out any form. Do we need to file for 2020?”  Even if you don’t normally file taxes for whatever reason, you  need  to file this year to claim any missing stimulus money through the  Recovery Rebate Credit  10. Is there going to be another check for $1400?  The government is still talking about this and while there will probably be an additional check, we don’t know exactly how much, or when it will be sent If you need additional support during this time, with paying bills or utilities, here’s a  list of helpful resources   11. Someone stole my identity. How do I get my stimulus check?  We’re so sorry to hear your identity has been stolen Visit  IDENTITYTHEFT.GOV  to make a plan to recover your identity and receive your payment Remember to be careful with your personal information  Don’t give away any  personal info online Don’t give away your money to debt collectors   12. How does the stimulus impact my student loans?  Your student loan debt, both interest and payments, is on pause through September 30, 2021. There may be additional resources in your state, depending on where you live  If you need additional help with student loan repayment, talk with your student loan servicer about options, including switching to an income-driven repayment plan Also, check out the  three ways your student loans can be forgiven  13. Is there anything that can help me with my rent if I’m facing eviction?   There is a  ban on evictions through March 31, 2021 . Some states are even extending that. What you’ll need to do now is to give a  signed declaration of hardship  to your landlord  14. If we didn’t apply for EIDL the first time, will we have an opportunity to do so?  Yes, you can still apply for the EIDL.  Here’s what you need to know.   15. If my family member is in jail, can they receive a stimulus check?  Yes, they can . They need to file their tax return if they haven’t received it yet  Want to stay connected so you can attend our next FREE Ask an Expert session?

{"prompt":"Sylvia’s Story: Home Ownership in the Future","completion":" Meet Sylvia, an HR Manager for the Clark County School District in Nevada. She’s a Las Vegas native who lives with her husband and two adult sons.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  Nothing! That’s why I’m in debt now. I don’t think I was ever taught how to save or how important your credit score was. Really, what I learned from my parents was how easy it is to come into debt. Saving money wasn’t a conversation in our household growing up.  What have been the highest and lowest financial points in your life?  As far as accumulating credit card debt, I’m working on paying off the smallest amount then moving on to the next one. I want to get credit card debt out of the way to boost my credit score, and then I can focus on other things like owning my own home.  I’m also deep in debt with student loans that I’ve been paying off for who knows how long. Actually, I’m still finishing school. In December, I’ll be done with my master’s program in human resource management.   I’ve grown in my work. Career wise, I’m moving in the right direction. Hopefully, I’ll get a better job or promotion. At my current job, we haven’t had raises in nine years or increases in salary based on cost of living. To keep losing money isn’t feasible, you know?   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Save money regardless of how much you earn. Make sure you’re putting something aside.  What are your goals for the future?  I want to pay off my debt and become a homeowner. In five years, hopefully I’m where I need to be.  What does money mean to you in your life?  You need it to live, but I take it day by day. You need it for the things you want. "}

{"prompt":"What you need to do now to receive the Child Tax Credit payments starting July 15","completion":" Stop! Don’t know where to start when it comes to claiming the Child Tax Credit?  Take our short quiz to find out .  Thanks to the improved  Child Tax Credit this year , you could receive  up to an extra $300  for each child in your family, each month from July through December. Here’s what you need to know.  The breakdown  If you filed tax returns for 2019 or 2020 or signed up to receive a stimulus check from the IRS, you will get the Child Tax Credit payments  automatically for the next six months . You do not need to sign up or take any action. If you usually receive your tax returns through direct deposit, that’s how you will receive the advance monthly Child Tax Credit payments. And if you typically receive your tax return via check, then that’s how you’ll receive these payments.  Tip #1 : Signing up for  direct deposit with the IRS  could help you get your credit even faster than waiting for a check to arrive in the mail.  Tip #2 : If you would like to receive one lump sum Child Tax Credit next tax season instead,  use this tool to unenroll  and opt-out of monthly payments.  If you don’t typically file taxes, you may still be eligible to receive the Child Tax Credit  Many families with children are eligible for this crucial tax relief – including those who have not made enough money to be required to file taxes. The IRS has a  tool for non-filers  to receive the Child Tax Credit.  Tip #3 :  Use this tool from the IRS  to claim the Child Tax Credit.  Monthly payments versus one lump sum check  Starting July 15, families will start receiving monthly payments as high as $300 per child as part of the new expanded child tax credit. The most important thing to note about the 2021 Child Tax Credit is that it’s an  ADVANCE  tax credit. So instead of receiving one lump sum on your tax return, you will receive smaller monthly payments. And because the monthly payments are an advance credit, you will receive a smaller tax return in the new year.   Parents alternating who claims a child each year may be the most common situation where a taxpayer may receive the advance child tax credit payments even when they won’t be claiming the child. If you claimed a child for the tax year 2020 but the other parent will claim them for the tax year 2021, you  may want to opt-out of the advance child tax credit payments .  Protect yourself from fraud  Unfortunately, scammers may try to take advantage of people receiving the credit. Here’s how to stay one step ahead:  Be extremely careful about what you share on social media related to your taxes.  Go to official sources like the IRS website to get information. The IRS’s  Taxpayer Advocate Service  is a great resource to find trustworthy tips. Read more  tips on how to recognize a tax scam  and what to keep an eye out for.  Need more info?  Here’s the  official White House website  on the advance Child Tax Credit. You can also share your thoughts on the Child Tax Credit with other SaverLife members in our  community forum . "}

{"prompt":"Meet Your Fellow Savers","completion":"   At the beginning of your journey with SaverLife, we asked you about your goals. Here’s what you and your fellow savers said!  EARN Savers have big goals!  YES, we do! (I’m saving too!) I’m not at all surprised that housing is at the top of our “goals” list. That makes perfect sense! Buying a home is no easy feat, and given the high cost of renting, homeownership may be the best way to create housing stability and build financial security. So if this is your goal, keep on saving and stay tuned for helpful info in the weeks to come. You can also learn more about the  pros and cons of home ownership .  I’m also glad to see that many of us are preparing for emergencies. You may have heard the  recent research  that 47% of Americans would not be able to weather a financial shock of $400. Keep up that saving, and you will certainly have options when (notice I didn’t say “if”) a financial setback hits.  Of course, having a main goal doesn’t mean that we don’t have competing financial priorities. This is really clear, since 35% of you said “other goals,” which is a great reminder that pursuing one goal doesn’t mean we can forget about others.  Take a moment to revisit your goals and the timeline. Look at your spending over the past 12 weeks and check it to see if your spending is aligned with what matters most to you. If you have more than one goal, think about the best way to approach them and remember, we are here to help you stay on track.  It Doesn’t Take Much To Start  I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: there is no such thing as “only a dollar” when it comes to saving. It is inspiring to see so many of you putting $20 a month toward your financial goals. Small steps can make a big difference, and the HABIT of saving is more important than the amount. If you found that saving $20 a month was easy,  set a stretch goal  for the upcoming weeks.  Check out this idea that many of my clients use to jumpstart (or boost) their savings: 52-week savings plan ( regular  and  reversed ).  Little by little, a little becomes a lot. ~ Tanzanian Proverb  How are YOU saving?  It was interesting to see that almost half of you are saving in checking accounts or prepaid cards and I’m wondering: How that is working for you? Are you able to distinguish what you want to save from what you plan to spend? If so, that’s great. If not, let us know and we can help you explore your options. Your savings decisions (where, when, and how) are yours to make and if you’re satisfied, we are thrilled. But if you’re not satisfied, we’ve got your back. Check out  second chance savings accounts  and see if that might work better for you.        All of this data comes from EARN’s research team, which publishes  monthly research insights . As always, we keep your personal information private and secure. "}
{"prompt":"Build Back Better Ensures Investment in Families","completion":" In July, we witnessed a new chapter in our country’s history. Direct payments of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) reached millions of families across the country and help was on the way for families with children who were struggling to pay for groceries, rent, or utilities, build rainy day funds, afford child care, and meet many other needs.  Here at SaverLife, we see firsthand what a difference the expanded CTC makes. The families we work with every day tell us how the expanded CTC means more food on the table, help with  childcare , and the ability to save for the future. We see how enhanced tax credits lead to better financial outcomes for families.   “I was able to afford new clothes for my daughter when she started kindergarten.  Having the payments now… has helped a lot with paying for childcare  which is super expensive.” —  Rhiannon , OH  This is why we celebrate the  Build Back Better  framework: a promise of much-needed investment in American families. Well before the pandemic, low- to moderate-income households were waging an uphill battle against poverty and inequality—especially Black and brown families, who have historically been overlooked and underserved. The Build Back Better framework expands the CTC for another year—and permanent refundability means that the lowest income families will still receive the CTC, lifting up millions.  “The expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) is the  most effective, poverty-fighting effort the federal government has launched  in a long time.” — Leigh Phillips, CEO and President of SaverLife  LOOKING TO THE FUTURE  That’s why we won’t stop fighting. At SaverLife, we believe that all children deserve a strong start and that investing in families means investing in the future. While this one-year expansion to the Child Tax Credit represents a victory for children and families nationwide, there remains much to be done. SaverLife will continue to advocate for the following:  Making the Child Tax Credit expansion  permanent  Ensuring every family that’s eligible for the Child Tax Credit receives it in a timely manner Supporting the eligibility of families with mixed tax filing statuses (SSN/ITIN holders)   Earlier this summer, we developed a four-part approach to guide our work on the Child Tax Credit. As we continue our advocacy, we remain committed to:  Ensuring Access  – Making sure all families are receiving these monthly, advanced tax credit payments or know how to receive these critical funds Encouraging Savings  – Highlighting the importance of preparing financially for the future and using this opportunity to  encourage our members to save  part of their payments Evaluating Impact  – Gaining a deep understanding of how families are using the Child Tax Credit, through interviews, surveys, and analysis of bank account data  Informing Stakeholders  – Sharing testimonies from parents as well as proposals for better processes and rollout of the Child Tax Credit in the years to come  Lastly, we’d like to highlight the long-term impact the Child Tax Credit expansion could have. Almost 75% of parents would choose to invest in their kids’ education if the Child Tax Credit expansion were permanent, building a foundation for economic mobility.    We hope you will  join us  in 2022 as we continue to advocate for making the expanded Child Tax Credit permanent.  "}
{"prompt":"Meet Jennifer: A Mother Building Financial Security for Her Family","completion":" Jennifer is an accountant who lives with her family in Clearlake, Wisconsin. She was selected as one of our 2020 Super Saver of the Year finalists. After filing for bankruptcy, she is committed to creating a financially secure future for her family.   “Growing up, I had no concept of money,” Jennifer said. As she became an adult and started her own family, her financial situation worsened. “My son has medical issues, so we have a lot of added expenses. We were spending way more than what we had. An emergency fund was nonexistent for us.”  The family reached their breaking point in March 2020 when they filed for bankruptcy.   “We were so far in the hole with using credit cards to make ends meet,” Jennifer said. “The credit card payments were way more than we could afford.”  The bankruptcy forced Jennifer and her husband to take a hard look at their financial situation.    It was around this time that Jennifer’s brother introduced her to SaverLife. They took their tax return and put all of it into savings. She also set up automatic deposits from her paycheck to her dedicated savings account.   “Any extra money we have goes into savings,” she said. “We are more knowledgeable and aware of where we’re spending money.”  Jennifer enjoys playing  Scratch & Save  and reading  members’ stories  on the SaverLife website.   “It’s a great place to get information,” she said. “It doesn’t matter where you’re at in your financial journey— there’s people out there like you .”  She plans to use her prize money to save for a down payment on a house and pay down her student loan debt. It’s important to Jennifer to keep saving and learn and grow from her past financial mistakes.   “SaverLife has taught me the importance of saving and that it doesn’t matter how much—$100 or $2—saving is saving,” she said.

{"prompt":"Buchi’s Story: Experiences Instead of Material Items","completion":" Meet Buchi, a self-employed bookkeeper who lives and works in San Francisco.  What do you do?  I’m disabled and I’m self-employed with bookkeeping. I do that on the side. It’s been good for these last 9-12 years.   What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  (laughs) Well, to manage money responsibly. Here in the US, I had to learn that. Growing up in Nigeria, where mommy and daddy took care of your expenses, when you need something, they’ll get it for you. Getting to the U.S., I had to learn how to take care of me, myself, and I.  What have been your lowest and highest financial point?  At my lowest, the recession hit and I fell hard. I had to work my way out of debt and that’s how I learned how to manage my finances. I’m in a much better spot now.  I would say my highest was getting out of debt in 2012 and just surviving off of what I could afford. No credit cards, nothing. Now, if I can’t afford it, I have to let it go. I learned to concentrate on my needs rather than my wants.  What’s your advice to people looking to get out of debt?  Take out a piece of paper, write down how much all your outings cost, and be honest with yourself. What is a need and what is a want? Stop feeling sorry for yourself and start being proactive about your situation.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  The best advice I received is save, save, save, save – no matter how little. It counts. Every nickel, every penny. Always have savings in the back of your mind.   What’s one thing you know about money now that you wish you knew when you were younger?  One thing I know now is that it’s always better to do a one sum payment than to pay monthly. When you pay all at once, you know you’ve paid for it all. If you save, you’ll be able to afford those big items.  What are your goals for the future?  I still want to still be able to travel and see the world. I’ve come to live my life and spend my money on experiences rather than material items. I want to visit Italy, walk around, and try the seafood. I’d rather have money to have those experiences than spend it on a Louis Vuitton handbag.   What does money mean to you in your life?  To be honest, I have two definitions: one from my upbringing, and the one I have now.  Growing up, I associated money with power and respect.  Since moving to the U.S., money has become a piece a paper and nothing more. It just brings you to the next point in life.   What are some savings goals of yours?  A goal of mine is to be able to keep getting by and have some money to be able to afford rent in San Francisco. I’d also like to be able to take care of myself because I have a surgery coming up. Lastly, I want to be able to pay off one of my high-interest credit cards. "}
{"prompt":"Making Fee-Free Financial Services Available to Everyone","completion":" The California Public Banking Option Act, or  BankCal , is an initiative to establish a public bank in California with basic consumer banking services, such as checking and savings. The bill builds upon programs such as CalSavers and CalKids, which aim to address the racial wealth gap in the state, by helping all Californians have access to safe and affordable banking services. Right now, 1 in 2 Black and Latino households, and 1 in 4 California households lack access to basic financial services—paying proportionately more to access the money they earn, lack secure means to save, and have fewer opportunities to build credit.   BankCal would offer every Californian the opportunity to open a zero-fee, zero-penalty debit account and debit card, direct deposit from employers and for public benefits, electronic bill pay to registered payees, and an infrastructure to help account holders build credit.   BankCal does  not  create a new bank. Instead, it creates a statewide retail banking option through which every California worker can access zero-cost financial services. All Californians would be eligible to opt-in to BankCal, and participation would be voluntary. Account-holders use the account to directly deposit their pay or receive public benefits such as federal and state stimulus funds.   Have you had a bad banking experience?

{"prompt":"Kirsten’s Story: Adjusting to Life in Lockdown","completion":" Meet Kirsten, who lives with her sons and fiancé in Myrtle Beach, SC.    Who’s in your family?  I have two boys and a fiancé who’s basically a husband at this point. My youngest, Grayson, is five years old, and my oldest, Peyton, is seven years old. It’s hard managing two boys, but it’s manageable.   What’s your profession?  Before our city was shut down like a month ago due to coronavirus, I used to do DoorDash and Grubhub. Working for DoorDash was great because I created my own schedule. I used to wait tables, but I hated having a schedule and working until 5 or 10pm. With the flexibility to work when I wanted, I was able to watch my boys at all their sports games. I was able to work my way up to the point that I could turn the app on or off and not have to worry about getting every order.  Now, I just sell things on eBay and Mercari. They’re both great because people are online shopping from their homes.  What does a day in your life currently look like?   Nowadays, we wake up, I cook breakfast for myself and the boys, and then we’ll do homeschool. We start with Grayson, my youngest, then work on Peyton’s homework. My youngest got accepted into his preschool’s early childhood development program. After homeschool is done for the day, we do crafts together, I make dinner, we have our outside time, we come back inside to watch a movie, and then it’s time to put the boys to bed. My husband comes home from work around dinner time, so we get to do our boys’ night routine together.  My fiancé and I still have date night when we can. If we really wanted, we would have the weekends to ourselves because my mother-in-law and nana are really close by. My mother-in-law lives next door to us, and my nana lives behind us. We have 10 acres all around us, so we’ve got a lot of space.   My mom is actually going to keep my boys for what would’ve been their spring break next week, so they’ll get to see their nana and papa. They’ve been spending time with their nana since this all started. My boys haven’t gone anywhere except her house and neither have we.    What do your kids think about what’s going on right now?  They’ve dealt with the lockdown well, but the biggest thing they don’t understand why they can’t go to the grocery store with me like they usually do. That’s the only place I ever go now. Neither of my boys have left the house since this whole thing started. We try to keep them on schedule with school since they have e-learning packets that we submit every two weeks. My youngest keeps begging me, “Can I please go to the dollar store with you?”  In terms of crafts, Peyton is helping my fiancé dig a trench in our backyard for the boys’ new playground.  How has the shelter-in-place mandate affected your family?  We’re trying to be as careful as we can. Grayson, my youngest, got sick when he was really young. We were in the pediatric ICU for some time, and he was in a medically induced coma for three weeks of his time there. His lung condition is fine now, but we’ve had to go a cardiologist every six months since then. I don’t know how the coronavirus could affect him because he had prior lung issues, so we’re taking precautions. My mother-in-law has COPD and my nana is 83-years old, so we’re watching out for them as well.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  I haven’t been working, but we’re still paying two car payments. My fiancé Ray recently said, “We have money right now. How crazy would it be to work DoorDash and take an unnecessary health risk?” It’s not worth it. We have a bit of a cushion that we have if we need it.  What would you like to do after this is all over?  We really want to go on vacation to Gatlinburg. That’s what we had planned to do next week. We also want to take our sons to see their first baseball game.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I love the website and what it’s about. I love using it, and I think it’s a great tool. I’ve only been a member for two months, but I’ve been using SaverLife to help me save up for a car payment. "}
{"prompt":"Ines’s Story: Living Within Her Means","completion":" Meet Ines, a financial coach for the community nonprofit IronBound, who lives with her three children and husband in North New Jersey.  What do you do?  I’ve been a financial coach for a little over a year. I work for a nonprofit social service corporation called Ironbound Community Corporation.   It’s right up my alley because I have a major in finance and a minor in psychology. I get to help community members who aren’t familiar with budgeting and money management using my education and own best practices.   I’m self-taught and a self-learner. My nonprofit doesn’t offer training, but they try to send us to workshops and helpful events. When I first got there, there wasn’t anyone who trained me to do what I do now. It’s all about trial and error when assisting community members.   I love what I do and I plan to stay here as long as the position is available. I say that because as a nonprofit, we’re always looking for funding.   What did your childhood teach you about money?  There wasn’t really any financial education during my childhood. My parents didn’t teach me the value of money because they didn’t receive any that they can pass down to me and my siblings.   Now as a financial coach, I see the importance of starting to teach kids at a young age.   As a child, I was never really taught how to save. As a young adult, when you start earning income, you think you could do anything you want with your money. I wasn’t taught about saving money or saving for big purchases. Money came and went out; there was no savings for financial goals.   When have you felt most financially secure?  I think it was after I graduated college and got my first job. I still lived with my parents and I had a full-time job that was helping me pay for my immediate expenses. Back then, I didn’t have any priorities, so I didn’t have to worry about monthly expenses. Now, my mentality is different from when I was single. My priorities have changed now that I am married and have three kids.    What’s the best piece of financial advice you tell your clients?  I always tell them to keep in mind: what is your financial goal? Ask yourself, “Is this (impulse buying) worth you not having the money you want to save up for your goal?” That’s my thought process.   What’s your thought process when saving up for something?   Once I have a financial goal in mind, I keep thinking about my purchases. Is this purchase going to keep me from getting one step closer to my goal? Sometimes I have to give up something I want at the moment for something I want later in life.   What are your financial goals?  In the long-term, I want to be able to purchase a home for my family. I’m currently renting, but it’s getting more expensive. I don’t like the idea of renting when I know that I could be putting that money towards purchasing my own house.   In the short-term, I want to pay off my car because right now I’m in a leasing agreement, and as a financial coach I learned that it’s not the best option. My goal is to buy my car out by the end of this year and then focus on building up my savings to purchase a home.   What does a financial achievement look like for you or your clients?  Financial achievement is being on track with your finances. At the end of the day, you want to learn and be able to live within your means. It’s living outside of what you can afford—that’s the problem. I try to help my clients change their money habits. That’s also something I try to keep in mind for myself as well.   Get used to living with what you can afford so you’re never in a situation where you feel financially stressed.   What does money mean to you in your life?  It’s a tool to survive and put food on the table. I don’t like to look at it that way, but that’s how I view it.   As a financial coach, do you teach your kids any money lessons?  My kids are still very little (four-year-old, three-year-old, and one-year-old), so they haven’t had any real exposure to money. When they get a little older, I’ll obviously teach them. When we go to the supermarket, I explain to them we can only get things we can afford, and I try to teach them through those experiences.   How did you feel about winning $50 from the SaverLife Tax Time Pledge?  I’m always trying to make money, so it was a really nice surprise! That’s $50 that’ll go towards my kids’ savings. Every extra bit of money I get, I put into my kids’ savings funds. I hope it’ll help them with funding their education.  "}
{"prompt":"Week 1 Stash Cash Quiz Results","completion":" Here are the results from our first holiday savings quiz! Scroll through to see what members answered and  take the quiz yourself .  1. I regularly save for things like travel, cars, and gifts.   It’s essential to save for future expenses like travel, cars, and gifts, so you don’t go into debt or miss a bill in order to cover the cost. Make sure you are including short-term expenses in your budget!  2. I set aside money for emergencies monthly.   Saving is about consistency, not the dollar amount. Saving $5 a week is better than not saving at all. If you struggle to save, use the guidance in this article,  3 Reasons to Set Up an Automatic Plan , to start saving. Saving is about consistency, not the dollar amount. Saving $5 a week is better than not saving at all.  3. Which of these best describes how you see yourself?   Being self-aware of your spending habits helps you identify and develop ways to control your spending. For instance, if you overspend on eating out or shopping, you may decide only to use cash or wait for 24 hours before buying anything.  4. Are you able to save?   Your mindset about saving can affect your ability to save. Even if you can only save $5 a week, it’s still a savings win!  5. What’s a rule of thumb for how much to save for emergencies?   A rule of thumb from most financial professionals is to save 3 to 6 months of expenses. This amount helps you cover a few months of job loss or major expenses like needing a new car transmission.   6. What’s a good reason to save money?   Prevent the financial “sticker shock” of having to pay for short-term expenses by saving a small amount monthly to cover the cost. For instance, if you have a $200 budget for expenses, save $50 a month for four months.  7. What does “pay yourself first” mean?   “Paying yourself first” is all about prioritizing saving to cover the unexpected before spending money on other expenses. It’s shifting how you manage your money to a “savings mentality.” This means when you get paid, save part of your paycheck and decide how to spend the rest.

{"prompt":"Kimm’s Story: Surviving the Coronavirus Lockdown","completion":" Meet Kimm, a hairdresser who lives with her children and granddaughter in Houston, Texas.  Who’s in your family?  Me, my kids, and my granddaughter.  What do you do?  Before the coronavirus hit, I was a hairdresser. That’s my life. I’ve been doing that for over 17 years. But I haven’t had an appointment for the past few weeks because of the coronavirus.  What does a day in your life look like during the coronavirus crisis? How is your family coping?  I don’t have a vehicle, so getting around is hard. Currently I’m waiting for my daughter to call back so she can help me get around. She works for a delivery – she does DoorDash. She’s the only one who can work right now since she has the vehicle. She’s 24. I’m praying for her because she’s with child, and she’s out there being exposed to the virus. They have an app – if it’s near, she grabs food from the restaurant and delivers it. She only does 2-3 dashes a day since there are so many people doing the same thing around the area.  How are you staying afloat financially?  I’m just trying to survive, period.   I found a website where you could get a raffle ticket for a laptop. My kids start school online on Monday but they don’t have a laptop or technology to do that.  It’s mandatory for my kids to be in school because there are lesson plans on there, but we don’t have a laptop for them to do work on.  As far as my granddaughter – there’s a packet of food for her. There was a food pantry we were supposed to go to yesterday, but we were a bit too late to get food.   Where are you turning to for resources like food and shelter?  We’ll go to my kids’ school tomorrow for food.  What are you doing right now to help stay grounded during this situation?  It’s just frustrating, to be honest. I’m feeling as if I’m failing my children. I have never had to tell them I didn’t have anything for them to eat.  What do you envision for your family’s future?  After the coronavirus is over, I’m thinking about moving closer to Fort Worth where my daughter is. She’s the one who’s currently working for DoorDash.  I’ll have to start over again. I’m from New Orleans. I was there during Hurricane Katrina.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather the coronavirus crisis?  I have already depleted every account, including my savings. I joined a few freelance websites like Veryable, Wonolo, and Trulancer. Not having my car has a huge impact on my ability to work right now.  What does money mean to you in your life?  I see money as a means for survival. Although money isn’t everything and it can’t really bring you happiness, you need it to be able to make ends meet.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  SaverLife has actually been a life saver. The Aunt Bertha has given me tons of resources. Before this disaster, I signed up for SaverLife not knowing how useful it would become. "}

{"prompt":"Michael’s Story: Keep Pressing Onward","completion":" Meet Michael, a homeless shelter employee and aspiring truck driver who lives in Little Rock, Arkansas.  What does your day-to-day look like right now?  I just completed an eight-month recovery program here at the homeless shelter. Next week, I’m starting truck driving school. It’s 20 weeks of classes. I don’t know where I’ll be placed after I graduate from the school, but I hope it’s somewhere close by.  In the short term, I do want to be able to have an emergency fund. Here at the shelter, they try to teach about finances and things like that, but the class is only 45 minutes and meets just once a week.  What have you learned so far in that class?  Not much. We’re reading  The Money Answer Book  by Dave Ramsey right now. It’s kind of simple, common sense advice like “don’t use credit cards to pay for debt.”  What do you wish you were learning?  I want to learn how to better manage my money. I’ve never had a credit card before, but I have spent a lot of money in my life. I’d really like to be thrifty with my money. It’d also be helpful to learn how to have an emergency fund and how much I should put in there.   What do you do?  Right now, I’m working 42 hours a week at the shelter. I get to help out in the kitchen. It gives me a stipend of $40 every two weeks. I’m using that to pay my phone bill and bus pass. My phone bill is $50 (used to be $60), and my bus pass is $36 every month. The bus company has a discount for students, so I’m going to see if I can get a deal since I’m in trade school. Now I’ve added the cost of $52 for my truck driving class. I couldn’t quite afford that with my monthly stipend, so the director of the course said I could work part-time for him to make up the difference.  What’s nice is that I don’t have to worry about a food bill. At least not yet. I eat at the shelter, which has helped me save lots of money.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I remember my dad was thrifty, but my mom called him cheap. We didn’t run out of anything though. He made sure all four of us kids and my mom ate. We ate beans and potatoes and things like that—simple, home cooked meals. He was the kind of guy who didn’t buy anything stupid.   My upbringing influenced me a lot. Like, I know it’s cheaper to prepare your own food. As a truck driver, I know that I won’t be able to do that as much, so I’ll have to save in other ways. I was thinking I could put together sandwiches for the road.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Always have something to fall back on so you can last two weeks or a month without any income.  What are your goals for the future?  With truck driving, I have the opportunity to get a local job here after I graduate. There’s this program at the shelter where you can stay a year or two as you save up money. I was thinking of doing that because I want to be able to save enough money to get established somewhere modest or humble. "}
{"prompt":"Nicole’s Story: Live on Less Than You Earn","completion":" Meet Nicole, a social worker and mother of two in Atlanta, Georgia.  What do you do?  Right now, I’m working in logistics, but I was a social worker for a very long time. When I got married and had my kids, I took a break from social work because it’s a very involved career. So now I work in a logistics facility that’s about ten minutes away from my house.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  Growing up, my mom was a single mom taking care of four kids. I learned that there’s never going to be enough. Because my mom had divorced my dad and was taking care of us by herself, she just never had enough. She would work all month just to make ends meet for that month, then start all over again.  Not to discredit her, but she didn’t teach us a lot about finances. She just emphasized, make sure you finish school and get a good job.  What is your lowest financial point?  Three years ago, I decided to move back to Atlanta even though my husband was on the fence about moving. We were renting in Charlotte, but I had a townhouse in Atlanta with a big mortgage. I didn’t want to be paying rent when I was also paying a mortgage on a house I owned!  So we separated for five months and I moved down by myself. I had to declare bankruptcy. I was doing things that were not fiscally sound. I was making good money, but I couldn’t even see it because I was spending it so fast. I was spending it foolishly, frivolously. I was reckless.  How did you make a change?  My older sister is a finance guru – she can squeeze a nickel like no one else. She’s an accountant and exceptionally frugal.  When I got in a bad state, I called her. She sent me an Excel spreadsheet with a sample budget. We got all my bills, put them into separate piles: things I had to pay, things I could pay off in bankruptcy, and things I could get rid of.  After that, I started bagging lunches. I give myself one day a week as a treat to go out to eat, with a $10 maximum. I just had to make fiscally responsible decisions.  I also got more careful about bank fees. If it’s not my ATM, I’m not going to use it. I’m not going to pay $5 to get my own money.  These are little things, but they add up over time. I had to put more thought into everything I did.  My brother was in the service, and he took me to Navy Federal, so I opened a separate savings account. So now $35 per pay period goes into that account. It doesn’t sound like much, but it adds up. It could be Christmas money, but it’s not going to be everyday money. And it’s just going to sit there out of reach and accrue interest.  What is your highest financial point?  Right around now is a high point for me! I’ve learned better money management and financial skills  and  I’m actually putting them into practice. I’m doing things in a positive way and I am doing it purposefully – not because I have to, but because I want a different way.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Live on less than you earn. Don’t owe people money.  I read it on Facebook. When I was at my lowest financial point, I was scrolling on FB and I had an epiphany, a moment of clarity –  I do that, I spend every dollar I earn, and I’m not saving anything.  What are your goals for the future?  I would like to own two more properties: a house outside of Charlotte because I like that area, and a house somewhere else. At the end of the day, I want to be able to gift both of my daughters a home, so that when they start their lives out, they don’t have to worry about bills.  I would like to be able to work and have that money go into investments. I want to work because I love what I do, not because I have to work to live.   My five-year-old is graduating from pre-k and will be school age soon. I told myself that I just need to get both of my babies into school, then I’ll go back to social work. I actually just got a call back on an interview to be a program coordinator for a nonprofit!  Nicole’s two daughters, her motivation for saving  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money used to be really important to me. Now it’s not so much. Now it’s more a medium for exchange. You can’t be a slave to it. You have to learn to master it. You have to learn how to not be a slave to money, but at the same time be very responsible with it.  I’ve had times when I was working working working. I worked so much that I rarely came home. I had spent all this money on furniture, but I was never home to enjoy it because I was paying it off! I had to work all the time to keep up with the Joneses, to keep up with the lifestyle that I thought I wanted.  At the end of the day, I realized that these material things don’t matter. You need money, but you don’t need as much as you think you need, especially if you’re more cautious with the money you have. Maybe you don’t need more money, you just need to do more with what you have. "}

{"prompt":"Edna’s Story: Debt-Free Since 2017","completion":" Meet Edna, a speech pathologist who lives with her daughter in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Did the pandemic impact you?  I’m a self-employed speech pathologist. Fortunately, I wasn’t financially affected by the pandemic. If anything, my business grew. I attribute that to running my business on the leaner side before COVID. Initially, there was a month where I didn’t see anyone in person, but by summer, I was completely booked.  My daughter is in fifth grade currently. Her school has been online since the pandemic started last year. She’s looking forward to going back in person very soon! I recently set up in-person tutoring for her, so she’s doing those 2 – 3 days a week.  Have you and your daughter talked about money management?  My daughter has her own bank account. She gets an allowance based on certain things she does. Right now, she’s saving for games and college. I’m proud that she’s learned the value of money.  Tell me more about your business.  I started my Speech Path business in 2018 and was fully self-sufficient by 2019. When the pandemic hit, I’d only been on my own for 6-7 months. I knew that even if I didn’t have clients, I would be okay because I had saved up a year’s worth of living expenses.   What is your history with paying off debt?  In 2012, I started to get serious about paying off my debt. I had a reality check in 2016 when my dad got really sick. I decided I needed to get out of debt  permanently  and create a better financial plan for the future. The Budgetnista’s Facebook Group, Dream Catchers, introduced me to SaverLife.   SaverLife has helped me be more accountable with my savings. I’ve learned to pay myself first, which includes paying off my debt. I was debt-free by the end of 2017. I thought, “I don’t want to go down this road again.”     Once I became debt-free, I put aside the same amount of money I’d use to pay off my debt into a savings account. I took a part-time job that went straight to paying off my debt. The pandemic reminded me how important it is to have an emergency fund. If I’d kept up with my old financial habits, things could’ve gone the other way. After I built my emergency fund, I learned more about investing. That’s helped me a lot because I was about to build my own business without taking out any loans.  When I was in debt, I would pay off debt and put money in savings first. I unfollowed a lot of people and companies on social media that I felt would tempt me to use my credit card and spend money on unnecessary items. I was lucky enough to have found an accountability partner.  How did you find out about SaverLife?  I found out about SaverLife a few years ago when it was called EARN. SaverLife has definitely helped me save. Today, I have multiple savings accounts totaling up to about $40,000. If it wasn’t for SaverLife, I still would have gotten there, but it would have taken a  lot  longer.   Saving money became easier after I was able to stash away $5,000. That was the magic number for me. Up until then, it felt like every time I put money in my emergency fund, something would happen and I’d need to use my savings.   What are your favorite SaverLife features?  I like going on the  community forum  to chat with other members about their experiences with money. The  Money 101 articles  are really helpful, too. Lastly, I like the ongoing  savings challenges . Since joining, I’ve referred many people to SaverLife.  What would you tell someone who’s thinking about joining SaverLife?  Remember that savings doesn’t happen overnight. There are no shortcuts. Know that there are other members in the community forum and in the  Saver Stories section  that are in similar financial situations. The pattern of saving will not be a linear trajectory.  "}
{"prompt":"Answers to Your 5 Most Common Questions About Voting","completion":" When you vote, you help create and nurture a better society. People in your community are going to be voting. Are you going to be one of them?  Your vote counts, both in national elections (like the upcoming presidential election) as well as those in your town and state. The decisions you make and the leaders you elect have an impact on your life, so creating the future you want to have begins with a vote.     A lot of people intend to vote, but you need to read the fine print to make sure you’ll be able to vote.  Read our last article  to figure out whether you’re already registered, then read this one for next steps to register to vote.  1. How can I register to vote?  The voter registration process is similar from state to state, with some variations. Typically, there are up to three ways you can register to vote:  In person . You can register to vote on election day right at your polling place in some states. In others, you must register 7 days or 30 days in advance. Check your state’s rules carefully. By mail . Some states require mail-in registration be postmarked 30 days in advance.  Online . Some states require advanced online registration; others allow it on election day.   If you vote in person or online, you will get instant verification that you are registered to vote. If you mail in your registration, you may not receive verification. You will need to check later to ensure you’re successfully registered.  Vote.gov  has great state-by-state resources for voter registration. Enter your state or territory, and you’ll see critical basic information:  The primary way to register in your state Alternate ways to register in your state (for instance, to register to vote by mail) Voter registration deadlines in your state The next general election day  2. What are the voting requirements in my state?  In addition to registering to vote, you must be eligible to vote in the first place. You cannot vote if you are not a citizen, even if you are a permanent legal resident of the U.S. You also cannot vote for president in the general election if you live in a U.S. territory, even if you’re a citizen.  In almost every state, you must also be 18 years old by or on election day. Here is a  chart  with age requirements for voting in every state.   Some states have other eligibility requirements as well. Check with your  state election office .  3. Can I vote if I have been convicted of a felony in the past?  Rules vary from state to state. In Maine and Vermont, you retain voting rights even while in prison. If you were released from prison, your voting rights are restored automatically in many states. In others, you must first complete parole and probation before you can legally vote again. In California and Connecticut, you can vote while on probation. And in eight states, voting rights restoration depends on the date or type of your conviction, repayment of fines, and outcome of your petition to the government or gubernatorial pardon.  For more information, research the  rules in your state .  4. Can I vote if I am experiencing homelessness and do not have a home address?  While most states require a home address in order to register to vote, that does not mean you can’t vote if you’re currently experiencing homelessness. Persons experiencing homelessness can register and vote in all 50 states.  Nonprofitvote.org  recommends that you list a shelter address where you can receive mail as your voting address. You may also denote a street corner or park as your residence.   5. If I have a disability, can I vote, and how?

{"prompt":"Need Help Paying Rent and Utilities?","completion":" Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, we know it’s become even more difficult to pay for rent and utilities. That’s why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) developed an online, mobile-friendly tool that’s especially meant to help those who are impacted the most by high housing costs: small landlords, women, and people of color (POC). 11 million renters are facing eviction, but help is available. Congress set aside $46 billion to help landlords and renters across the country.  This tool  gives you access to see almost  500 housing and rental assistance programs available nationwide.  Tip   #1 :  Some of these programs can help with both rent and utilities, such as gas and water!  When using the CFPB’s online tool, start with your local program. If you decide to apply for rental assistance.  Tip   #2 :  The CFPB advises that you do not submit multiple applications at once—stick to one.

{"prompt":"Courtney’s Story: Pursuing the F.I.R.E. Lifestyle","completion":" Meet Courtney, a Membership & Business Development Director for a Chamber of Commerce who lives in Connecticut  What’s your profession?  I’m the Membership & Business Development Director for a local Chamber of Commerce here in Connecticut.  What does your day-to-day look like?  It’s pretty standard these days. I wake up, go to work, then go home. Since the COVID-19 pandemic pretty much shut most things down, there’s not much to do. Whenever I have some time to myself, I like to unwind by watching tv or managing my online side business. And every so often, I’ll take day or weekend trips here and there.  Can you tell me more about your side business?  I’m a reseller. So, I go thrifting or family and friends bring me their clothes to sell for them. Reselling clothing has helped me hit my financial goals over the last two years.  How’d you get into the business of reselling?  My niece was at my house one day and showed me the Poshmark app. I started off selling jewelry and moved onto selling clothing, too. During the pandemic, I’ve actually brought in an extra $2,000 a month through this side hustle.   Do you have any student loans? What does paying them down look like?  I do have student loans left. At the time I got the loans, I was so lucky that the interest rate at the time was 2.5%. Now that I look back on it, I should have paid them off sooner. It’s only been in the last two years that I really focused on taking care of the last of my remaining student loans. The federal moratorium on student loans has been really helpful. I’ve definitely taken advantage of the temporary 0% interest rate. My plan is to keep paying my loans down as much as I can.  What does budgeting look like for you?  About two years ago, a friend introduced me to Dave Ramsey. She gave me a pre-made Excel sheet, so, all I had to do was input my income and expenses, and it took the work out of manually having to budget. Every two weeks, I update the spreadsheet. What was nice was that everything is down to the penny. After my expenses and like groceries and gas, whatever is leftover I put into savings.  Are you saving for anything in particular?  Normally I’d be saving for vacations or concerts, but now I’ve been blessed with being able to put that money into my savings. I don’t know if I would’ve gotten better at saving had it not been for the pandemic.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather the pandemic?  Fortunately, I haven’t had to dip into my savings. I’ve just been using my savings buckets to pay for investments like my house. Besides my savings buckets, I don’t touch my emergency fund.  Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  I moved from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage. At 35 years old, I’m very proud of this accomplishment! My ultimate goal is to pay off my house by the time I’m 50 years old. Ultimately, I’d like to retire with a million dollars and retire as early as possible. "}
{"prompt":"Kelly’s Story: Job Searching During the Coronavirus Pandemic","completion":" Meet Kelly, an attorney who’s living with her family in Branchburg, NJ.   Tell me what it’s like where you live.  For the time being, I’m in Branchburg, New Jersey. The governor ordered everything to shut down, and most establishments—except for the restaurants—are closed.   I’m living with relatives right now.  Do you have a profession?  I’m an attorney by trade, but right now I’m in the midst of a career change. I’m currently looking for a new position in the human resources field. I wasn’t really satisfied with the legal world, so I wanted to do something that was more interesting to me.   There are a lot of transferrable skills between law and human resources, and I’m interested in employment law specifically.   Has your job search been impacted by the coronavirus?  Yes. It’s definitely harder for me to find open positions. A lot of companies are either not hiring right now or hiring has diminished.  What does a day in your life currently look like?  A typical day includes job search seminars and networking seminars throughout the day. I might have a job search seminar at 10am, then a networking meeting at 1pm, and then maybe another job search seminar at 3pm. In between those seminars and meetings, I’m looking for and applying to different positions.  Have you filed for unemployment?   No. I haven’t done so because I had some system issues when I was trying to create an account. I contacted the Department of Labor, but unfortunately no one has gotten back to me yet.  How is your family coping with what’s going on in the world?  They’re doing as well as they can. In addition to wearing gloves and using hand sanitizer, they wear masks when they go out for essential errands, which is not often.   What do you envision for your future?  Full-time employment, with significant pay, at a position I enjoy.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  Yes, I did actually have to use my savings recently. I used what I had to pay for rent and groceries.   What does money mean to you in your life?  Money means freedom to create your own opportunities, such as a business, without relying on others to provide an opportunity for you.  Did you have any money lessons growing up?  Yes. I learned how to save money in a savings account, a money market account, and CD’s.  What does your budgeting look like these days?  My budget is sparse. Most of my money is allocated for food and gasoline.  Are you able to save money right now?  I save a small amount.   "}
{"prompt":"Princess’s Story: The Glue That Holds Her Family Together","completion":" Meet Princess, a full-time college student and part-time caregiver who lives with her mom in Springfield, Virginia.  How do you like living in Virginia?  I really like where I live because it’s near where my family is and it’s also close to my college, George Mason University. It’s also near Washington D.C., which is nice. The only downside is that the cost of living is expensive.  What’s your profession?  Besides going to school full-time, I work part-time as a caregiver. What I do is called companionship. Most days, I care for this older lady who has physical disabilities and can’t care for herself. I assist her in things like changing clothes, exercising, feeding her, and helping her walk. Her residence is only about a 15 to 20-minute drive away, so it’s in a pretty convenient location. Before my school closed because of the coronavirus, I would go straight to her residence right after school.  What are you studying in college?  I’m currently studying Accounting because I like math. Before this, I was earning my associate degree in Engineering from Northern Virginia Community College. I decided to switch majors because it cost me less credits overall to earn a degree in Accounting than it did for Engineering, 66 credits instead of 75.  Currently, I have classes four days a week, and spend about 12 to 15 hours in class. This doesn’t include the amount of time I spend on my purely online classes. That workload hasn’t changed.   Purely online classes due to the coronavirus are a bit tough right now because the owners of the house I’m renting a room in can’t afford Wi-Fi. Actually, SaverLife resources have helped me find companies that are giving free Wi-Fi for 60 days, so I’m exploring that as an option. My school’s library is closed, so I can’t go there for Wi-Fi either.  What’s your living situation like?  Right now, my mom and I are renting a room in someone’s house for $450 a month, and my two older siblings are staying with my grandma in her two-bedroom condominium. It’s a bit crowded at her condo since my grandma also has her daughter and other grandkids living with her. Including my older brother and older sister, there are about seven people total living in her two-bedroom condo.  My mom and I are renting an apartment so we can continue to petition for my dad to come here from the Philippines and can have a place for him to stay when he arrives. Once he’s here, we’re going to try and find a place big enough to house my mom, dad, brother, sister, and me.  Are you currently saving up for anything?  We’re all trying to save up for a two-bedroom condo for my whole family, which includes my mom, dad, older brother, and older sister. We’d really like to have our own place to call home.   What does a day in your life currently look like?   These days, I’m a bit less productive. I’m used to getting up early around 9am and then getting ready to go to school. I usually have more energy in the morning since I’m physically getting ready to go somewhere. Knowing you’re not going somewhere is hard. Some days I don’t brush my teeth in the morning to go to my online class. I feel a bit guilty because I feel like I don’t do much during the day.  Also, I’m the only driver in the family, so I pick and drop everyone off to their jobs or wherever they need to go. My mom works at Popeyes six days a week and doesn’t take Uber or the bus. She said she’s scared of using public transportation because of coronavirus.  I’m looking forward to teaching my older brother how to drive. He and my older sister earned their college degrees in the Philippines, and they’re pretty new to Virginia.   The situation is tough, but I’m hoping it’ll be better soon. I guess the one upside of coronavirus is that I don’t have to drive to school and pay for as much gas these days.  What would you like to do after everything is back to normal?   I think I’ll go back to doing what I did before, which is take classes at school and save money for summer.  It’d be great if I could teach both my older siblings how to drive so they could drive themselves to their jobs.  What’s been your experience with SaverLife?  It’s really good. I was introduced to SaverLife by a former professor and mentor, Mrs. Diana. She was a professor at my community college as well as George Mason University, where I currently go to school. She was hired by the school to help new students with their financial aid. I believe she helps students with VITA tax services. Once I saw her on the SaverLife website and asked her what it was. I have her to thank for helping me buy a car.   SaverLife has helped me save. Before I was introduced to SaverLife, I didn’t really know how to budget, and I wasn’t aware of where my money was going. I learned the 80/20 rule from SaverLife.   There are so many resources that you can read on the site. I’ve read articles about filing taxes for free, and I’m learning how to save and pay off debt. SaverLife also offered the opportunity to talk to a financial coach, so I’m getting ready to set up an appointment to discuss my finances. I’m getting my questions ready. "}
{"prompt":"Meet Our Super Saver Grand Prize Winner!","completion":" Tara is our first ever Super Saver winner.  Tara lives in Roselle Park, New Jersey and has been a dedicated SaverLife member for two years. Tara is one of SaverLife’s most engaged members, and we’re grateful to have her as part of our community.   What’s your history with personal finance?  I grew up with not a lot of money. We were the poor people in town. One of my big goals when I started working was to save money and make sure I didn’t have to worry about where my next meal was coming from like I did as a kid. I try to save as much as possible.   Why is saving money important to you?   It’s so scary to not have money. I grew up not having money and don’t ever want to feel that way again.   How long have you been a SaverLife member?  I signed up for it two years ago. I must have read an article about it. I learned what SaverLife was, that if you linked your bank account, they would track it for six months, and if you manage to save $20 every month we’ll give you $20 at the end. I thought, “Okay, I can do that.”   Then I got an email about Scratch & Save. That was cool because it became like a game. I set up an automatic transfer so every week those $5 got transferred into my bank account and I get the scratcher. I’m utilizing all of SaverLife’s benefits. It’s so great!   What has your savings journey been like in the past few years?   I have been trying very hard to save. Emergencies happen and you have to dip into savings, and it’s an uphill battle to replenish those savings. SaverLife has helped me to bucket off my money so I have a true savings account. SaverLife is absolutely helping me save more money. It’s given me different goals to reach for.  What has SaverLife taught you?   The best part about SaverLife is it takes away the taboo of talking about money. SaverLife is the friend I can have and talk to about money with. It holds me accountable for the promises I make and goals I want to reach.   SaverLife has taught me that money isn’t scary. It’s taught me to do what I can. Everyone has to dip into emergency funds every once in a while. Every week is a new week and every month is a new month, and even if you can’t get that $5 for Scratch & Save this week–next week is a new week. You can always save in the future.   What are you going to use the prize money for?  A dream of mine is to max out my IRA, which is $6,000. Get a couple Christmas presents. I don’t know what I’m going to do! This is awesome.  "}
{"prompt":"5 Troubleshooting Tips for Linking Your Account","completion":" Linking your account to SaverLife opens up so many new doors along your saving journey! We want to make sure you have every SaverLife benefit available to you. Here are six tips for linking your account ⬇️  1. Double check your password and account credentials  This is the most common issue we see, and the easiest one to fix! Double check that you’re using the correct and most up-to-date version of your bank login password. If you are using a password saver that auto-fills your password, it may have an older version of your password saved. To see if this is the issue, log in to SaverLife in an incognito browser and try entering your bank credentials manually.  2. Try again in 12 hours  Unfortunately, sometimes the best thing to do is to wait then try again. For security reasons, if you enter the incorrect password too many times or your session expires, you may need to wait 12-36 hours. This clears up the issue for many people!  3. Try PayPal  If you’re unable to link your preferred bank account, try linking your PayPal account. Psssst, and when you win savings challenges, you can choose to have your cash reward sent straight to your PayPal! It’s like a little boost for your rainy day fund.  4. Open a new account  Another alternative is to open a dedicated savings account. SaverLife financial expert Linda Jacob has this to say about  savings accounts : “They have limited withdrawals, but usually only a $100 minimum in order to avoid a monthly fee. This account generally has a higher interest rate than a checking account, but lower than a money market account.”  5. Reach out to our member support team  If none of the above tips work for you or you need additional help, our member support team is always happy to troubleshoot any account linking issues you may have.  ***  And when you feel comfortable with how much you’ve saved in your emergency fund, consider starting a  sinking fund  for your not-so-unexpected-expenses like monthly bills, an upcoming car expense, or a family vacation.  Here are just a handful of benefits you’ll receive when you link your account:  You can participate in savings challenges like the Race to $100 When you save $5 each week, you’ll earn 250 points—enough to redeem a  Scratch & Save  card You’ll be able to set a 30-day savings goal and track your progress toward achieving it Many more features coming soon!

Celina was working as a case manager for a local nonprofit in New Haven, CT when she heard about SaverLife. A representative from United Way’s ALICE saves program, which helps families develop long-term savings habits, presented information to Celina’s clients about the benefits of using SaverLife.   Celina quickly signed up for SaverLife.  “I don’t like to recommend something unless I’ve tried it myself,” Celina said.   In the nearly two years since she became a SaverLife member, Celina has prioritized saving.  “Saving is one of the most important things I can do for myself,” she said. “SaverLife has helped me become more diligent with my savings habit.”    Not only has SaverLife helped Celina create a savings habit, but Celina also connected with a Neighborhood Trust financial advisor who helped her assess her goals and set up a budget. Her savings helped her make ends meet when she was laid off in January 2020. Now, she’s using SaverLife to help her pay for her graduate degree in social work.   “I was able to pay for my first year of graduate school without taking out any loans, and I’m on track to do the same for my second year. SaverLife has taught me that every $5 counts,” Celina said.   In the summer of 2021, Celina participated in a savings challenge and won $200 from SaverLife. The money came at the perfect time to help her pay the property taxes on her car without dipping into her savings.   When she graduates next year, Celina hopes to become a community organizer. She plans to continue saving and encourages others to make SaverLife part of their financial journey.   “Joining SaverLife is one of the best things you can do for yourself—and it’s completely free!” "}

{"prompt":"Anastacia’s Story: Helping Others in a Time of Need","completion":" Meet Anastacia, an intensive in-home counselor who lives in Roanoke, West Virginia.  What’s it like where you live?  I’ve lived in Roanoke for eight years now. I live with my boyfriend and two roommates in a house. We’re actually getting ready to move with our roommates to a new home in the same community!  My boyfriend and I aren’t sure about our plans for buying a house in the very near future, because we’re not sure where we’ll be at that point in our lives. We may move to a surrounding state soon.   What do you like about your community?  I like the Roanoke area because it’s very outdoor oriented. Everyone here in the community either runs, hikes, or bikes. We’re all very involved in our community and we support one another.  What’s your profession?  I am an intensive in-home counselor. That means I provide services to at-risk youth. I help them learn coping skills, anger management skills, and teach them how to deescalate the situation from getting physical so they don’t have to be removed from their home.  I’m going to be celebrating my two-year anniversary at this job soon.  What does a day in your life currently look like during the coronavirus lockdown?  It really depends on what I have to do because no one day is the same. Our office has had to adjust from providing face-to-face care to doing telehealth. My current schedule is a lot different than what it used to be. I’ve ended up having a lot more online meetings because we’re not able to see our different supervisors and coworkers throughout the day. My colleagues and I are doing more check-ins. Nowadays, I could have several meetings back-to-back before having a check-in with a client. In addition to that, I’m constantly checking my emails and attending trainings.  How is your household coping with what’s going on in the world?  We’re all trying to be a lot more mindful and take advantage of all the down time we have. Because we’re in the process of moving, this time at home has given us the opportunity to go through our belongings. We’re cleansing and purging all the things that no longer serve a good purpose.   I’m getting together my clothes and books that I no longer use. Because of the nature of my job, I have quite the number of games and activities that I’m looking to donate. There are a few local community organizations that are accepting those types of items to give to kids in the area, so I’m currently trying to figure out the specific donation protocol. I hope to donate them either by curbside pickup or by appointment.   Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  My boyfriend and I had the perfect storm of things happen along with COVID-19. Our situation escalated right after we got back from a road trip where we attended a wedding. Our car broke down on the way back, and our budget has been off ever since.  Before all that, I was in the process of building some savings. Unfortunately, I had to use a lot of that in addition to credit. I used what we had saved to pay for our hotel, rental car, and car repair. Now we’re trying to do damage control, build our savings, and pay off the debt that incurred.   What would you like to do after this is all over?  I mostly want to visit some family members that I haven’t been able to see for a while. My stepdad is immunosuppressed and just finished up a round of chemotherapy, and he lives two hours away. It’s been a month since I’ve seen him in person.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It usually means stress, but I’m looking to change how I actually think about it.   How did you found out about SaverLife?  I discovered SaverLife from Instagram actually, and I’ve enjoyed it so far! I think it’s been very beneficial and rewarding. I’ve taken advantage of everything that’s been offered on the site. The financial coaching has especially been helpful. I’ve gotten several cash rewards from some of the savings challenges I’ve participated in.  "}
{"prompt":"What Black History Month Means to Me: SaverLife’s Financial Coaches Reflect on Progress Made and the Work to Be Done","completion":" Black History Month is a time to reflect on how far we’ve come, as well as the road ahead to wealth equality. The percentage of black college graduates has doubled since 1990  from 11% to 25% . From 2007-2018, firms owned by black women  have gone up a whopping 164% . But, although there’s been progress, there’s a  nearly 10x wealth gap  between the typical net worth of a white family ($171,000) and the net worth of a black family ($17,150).  SaverLife financial coaches are dedicated to teaching people wealth-building habits to help  close the racial wealth gap . Below, our financial coaches write about what Black History Month means to them and their passion for helping to close the gap.  Changing My Family’s Financial Future, by Tania Brown, CFP  I grew up on welfare with a single mother. My family never talked about money, except for the lack of it. As a child, Black History Month was my reminder that your beginning does not define your future. It’s a reminder that I come from people who survived generations of unimaginable horrors yet never let go of the hope of a better future for the next generation.  These lessons never left me. While serving in the Army, I was blessed to have soldiers teach me about money. I learned that money could be a tool rather than a barrier to the future I wanted.   The moment I realized I would be the last generation in my family raised on welfare, I became determined to help as many people as I can change their financial family futures. This passion led me to a two-decade career in personal finance.  The greatest tribute I can give to all those who came before me—my mother who sacrificed everything for me, the soldiers who took me under their wings—is to serve all of you. To do anything I can to help you achieve your financial goals and change your family’s financial future.   Standing on the Shoulders of Those Who Came Before Me, by Carl Windom, AFC, FFC  As a financial coach, it gives me great satisfaction to celebrate Black History Month. I am proud to know that my lifetime effort to grow and evolve as a financial expert is a reality. In my generation, I felt free to be anything I wanted to be without pause or hesitation. As a result, I chose to study finance because I wanted to know on an expert level how money works. It is my delight to provide something of significance that can change lives and inspire people to be financially fit and well. I stand on the shoulders of many that have come before me.  As the need for financial literacy grows in the black community, so does my passion for learning and teaching financial and economic skills. As America celebrates Black History Month, I feel great pride to know that my lifetime of learning finance has empowered me to become a change leader in my community, and for many of my black brothers and sisters plus many other friends and neighbors in America and around the world. That is why Black History Month means so much to me.  Financial Health Means Freedom and Independence, by Elaine Harrison, AFC, FFC  Black History Month, and every other month, means helping others achieve financial health and wellness. As a financial coach, I strive to educate people about finances in the hope that they will achieve financial freedom.  In the Black community, financial health means more financial freedom and independence. Being able to earn, give, save, spend and invest for the future without stress is the goal. Being a part of a community that is undervalued, many may feel that financial health is unattainable. Many in the black community do not even use terms like financial health. Consistent and honest financial education—in a way that will be received—is necessary and essential.  Poor financial health in the Black community is rooted in generations of poor and misleading education and a lack of opportunity. Exploiting the black dollar is easy when you can convince someone that having more stuff like clothes, shoes, and cars makes them important.

{"prompt":"Meet the 2021 Tax Time Story Contest Winners!","completion":" Terri  is the Office Manager of Mock & Company Jewelry, a Black-owned business in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She and her boss,  Anthony , are the 2021 Tax Time Story Contest winners. They both won $2,500.   When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Terri was laid off from her job caring for an elderly woman. She connected with Anthony through her church and began working in the jewelry store in July 2020, eventually working her way up to full-time.   “When I saw the contest, I  instantly  thought of my boss,” she said. The contest asked SaverLife members to nominate someone they would gift their tax refund to and explain why.   Like many small business owners, the pandemic proved challenging for Anthony. After years of working in the jewelry industry, he started his own business in 2009. The pandemic forced him to look for new customers across the country.   Despite the hardships his own business was facing, Anthony was committed to helping others.   “Even though business wasn’t flourishing when the pandemic hit, he kept the shop open so his employees wouldn’t go without paychecks. He even gave us Christmas bonuses,” Terri said.    Below is Terri’s Tax Time Story Contest Submission:   “I would nominate my boss! He is a small business owner and has truly blessed many during this pandemic. Not only did he manage to give all his employees a very generous Christmas bonus, but he also paid not 1… not 2…. but 25 single moms’ utility bills during the Christmas season to help out and give them a little hope during such a trying time! And had done countless random acts of kindness for people all while running a new business taking care of his family (wife & 4 children) and making sure we never missed any of paycheck during COVID even if it came from his own personal funds! I would give him my tax return in a heartbeat just to let him know he is truly appreciated ❤️”   Anthony has always cared about giving back to his community. He was raised by a single mother, and it’s been his dream for his business to become successful enough that he can buy homes for single mothers. In 2020, he went through a local nonprofit to anonymously pay the utility bills of 20 single moms in the Pittsburgh area.   Anthony was humbled that Terri nominated him for the prize.   “It’s a blessing,” he said. “When you give with a sincere heart, it’s going to come back to you.”  Terri was “ecstatic” to find out Anthony had won.   “God has been answering so many prayers through this season,” she said. “[Anthony] can finally get something for himself! He gives so much that he rarely focuses on himself.”   Terri plans to save her portion of the prize money. She joined SaverLife five months ago and has been working on building her credit and saving for a down payment on a home. She took the 2020 Tax Time Pledge and used IRS Free File to save more money.   “I like the challenges—I signed up for the  Race to $100 ,” she said. “It gets you focused on the importance of saving.”  Anthony plans to use his portion to treat himself to a watch and save toward a down payment on a home in Florida.   “This is making me think that I want to do something bigger next year,” he said.  “Maybe pay for a camp for kids. God blessed me with this—what else can I do?”  Terri also plans to give some of her prize money away.   “I’m definitely going to pay it forward,” she said. “I won’t tell the person; they’re going to be surprised too!” "}
{"prompt":"Barbara’s Story: Service to Others","completion":" Barbara is an artist who lives in Carrboro, North Carolina. She is an active member of her church and a volunteer in her community.  Who lives in your household?  Just me. I have four grown children, but one of my sons Joel died a year ago in February.  That’s part of why I’m paying off debt – for me to be able to stay with Joel at different stages of his treatment, surgeries, and dying. It pushed me to my financial limit, but no one wants to die alone, and I didn’t want that for him. My debt was also related to three funerals and being with family members prior to their deaths. After my son died, it took a few weeks to clean up his rental property and hold a memorial.  I’m blessed to have a really good church community, which helps me. I’m not in over my head right now, but on my income, it’s taking everything I’ve got to pay back my debt. I live off donated food after my EBT runs out. It’s something I worry about every day. I know that the only way I can continue is if it’s God’s will for me.  What do you do?  I’m 65 and I’ve been disabled for a long time, since 2004. I have SSI and SSA, but I am on the low end of it. I have Section 8 and EBT, which is $130/month, and I get energy assistance.  I’m trying so hard to work out a budget and live within my means if there is a way to do it.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My parents were out of the Depression era. They always tried to live off the land. They knew from the Depression that if you didn’t own your own property and have cash under your mattress, you had nothing.  I was one of the first in my family to ever finish high school or go to college. They wanted for me not to have to work as a child because they both lived through tremendous deprivation as children.   I’m 65, and I’ve been doing art since I was 6. My father was a photographer, and my mother was an amazing artist. They were both untaught and became medical photographers and artists for Dartmouth College. It wasn’t a hippie thing. They were blue collar workers and could barely get by.  Growing up, they encouraged me to go out and do what they weren’t able to do. Even though they didn’t have money to pay for it, I earned money to pay for my own ballet lessons and arts and crafts.  What have been your lowest and highest financial points?  I don’t think I’ve ever had a high financial point. I’ve always lived in extreme duress and poverty. I’ve lost everything and been homeless.   In my 50s, I had Hepatitis C, I had severe depression, and had just come out of homelessness. I had to start over. I had to have another spinal fusion and had to go through treatment of Hep C, which I got from my husband. Then I couldn’t get treated for Hep C until I got the spinal fusion, and I was really sick for a long time. I got knocked down again and again.  The Hep C treatment was very hard and lasted a year. It was hard to get back in to art after that. I didn’t know how to reach out for help. I had given up on myself, and that’s the heart of addiction.  In the first six months of my sobriety, I faced my father’s death, my husband’s death, and the beginning of my son’s first major health problems. My son was previously a serious heroin addict, but he was sober for five years. He was diagnosed with untreatable life-threatening bacteria related to the use of needles. Over the following year he had to have a heart transplant and he had congestive heart failure and kidney failure. We went through these experiences together and stayed sober. Deep inside me, the spiritual reality and love of God took me out of the darkness. Some people call addiction the Dark Night of the Soul.  The spiritual and physical lessons I learned from sobriety are cornerstones for me to live with a current diagnosis of focal point dysphoria, which is a brain related movement disorder. We never know how much time we have and together we can make our lives better. The SaverLife program is a glimpse of hope because it provides matching funds and resources. I hope my story can help someone else can find inspiration or confirmation. Living within our means is important as we see our neighbors who seem to have a better material life.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Not that I’ve always lived by this, but my favorite advice is “live within your means.” It’s a spiritual as well as financial quest for me. One of the best things you can do is buy your own land and pay it off.  I am trying to create a budget that’s truly realistic for my daily needs. It takes spiritual discipline because I can’t rely on old habits or impulses. I’m a Christian, and it’s about thanking God first instead of reacting on emotion. I am trying to focus on what I do have. I need to trust that there is another way without asking impulsively what it is.  What are your goals for the future?  My main goal is to do something of value to help someone else and be of service to other people. I’m a member of churches, a member and volunteer of Interfaith Counsel, and I volunteer as a Special Olympics swimming coach.  It’s less about what I want, and more about what others need from me, to be able to be there, be present, and lift others. All you really need to do is be present and listen.  I hope to volunteer with women while they are in prison or jail and after they get out. For me, transition is the most difficult aspect of change. Hopefully my experience may be helpful to them. After fourteen years of surgeries, being homeless, having no credit, work, or friends, I became aware of many resources within my community. I started actively participating with groups or programs that helped me. Now my hand is available to others trying to better their lives. I am not paid for this work, but it’s a full-time job.  I want to make sure I leave this life with my debts paid and my apartment cleaned out, hopefully my burial paid for, and some means for my family to get together to celebrate life.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It doesn’t. I’ve learned that you earn your way through life. Nothing is free. We’re expected to take the gifts we are given and do the work we can do. If I can’t make ends meet, having more money may not fix that.  I hope that if your readers can read this and learn about my experiences, they don’t need to go through some of the struggles that I’ve been through. "}

{"prompt":"Lisa’s Story: Working as a Waitress During the COVID-19 Pandemic","completion":" Meet Lisa, a waitress and DoorDasher who lives with her husband in Louisiana.  What’s it like working in-person right now?  I’m working two jobs at the moment. My main job is serving and waitressing at a local restaurant. I’d consider myself a frontline worker because I’m interacting with folks in person a couple of days a week. I also started doing DoorDash as a side hustle this year.  In all honesty, it’s been crazy. Some days, I don’t even know if I want to go into work because so many people are sick and the number of COVID-19 cases keep rising in our area. But at the end of the day, I have to do what I have to do to support my family and especially my two kids.   What do you like about being a waitress?  I’ve been working in the restaurant industry since I was 18. I have a lot of experience working in restaurants, but I’ve enjoyed being a waitress the most. I would definitely consider myself a people person, which would explain why I love waitressing. As for the pay, you pretty much know what you’re going to make, and most of the time my bills are paid. The pandemic really threw our finances off though.  Were you and your family impacted at the start of the shelter-in-place mandates in March?  When this all started, I lost my job due to COVID-19 shutting places down. My family and I used to live in Georgia but have to move to Louisiana for jobs. Within the first two months of the shutdown, so many places closed and we didn’t know when they would open back up again. The restaurant I worked at in Georgia shut down completely. Things took a turn when that happened. All of a sudden, the bills and rent were due and we didn’t have an income to pay them. On top of that, my landlord evicted us. This was before the eviction moratorium was in place, so we didn’t have protection. It was like everything came crashing down.   Luckily, I have family in Louisiana, so we moved. Louisiana had some restaurants open at limited capacity, so my husband (he’s a sushi chef) and I were able to find work pretty quickly. We’re both following all health and safety protocols at our workplace. During my off days, I deliver food with DoorDash. It’s been nice because I haven’t had to deal with as many people as I would have if I were waitressing that day. The pay comes faster as well, so that’s a nice bonus.   Are your kids in school? What does that look like for them?  They’re staying with their grandma in California. It sucks that I don’t get to see them, but I know that what we’re sacrificing now will have all been worth it in the long run. When COVID-19 hit, my husband’s mom offered to take care of our kids while we found work. She’s a seasoned live dealer at a casino and has paid leave, so it wasn’t a big issue for her to take care of them. There’s a daycare facility at the casino as well, but it’s pretty expensive.  Walk me through a day in your life.  My shift hours are the same as my husband’s. Right now, we’re working 10am to 10pm with a break from 2-4:30pm. We’ve been working together for about three years, and I like to joke that my day consists of being around my husband all hours of the day.  We drive to and from work, which takes 25 minutes each way. Oddly enough, the pandemic didn’t slow the traffic in the downtown area. If anything, it’s stayed pretty much the same. You’d expect people to be staying home like they’re supposed to, but they’re out and about regardless. When the mayor put a mask mandate in place, downtown got even more busy. It’s sad because those who don’t care don’t realize how serious COVID-19 is until it happens to one of them or a family member.   Would you consider yourself financially stable?  Even before the pandemic, it was hard for us to be financially stable. I just had my daughter in November of last year, so I was depending on my husband and the income he earned because I couldn’t work. Working has helped me become more knowledgeable about things like money management and credit. I wasn’t the best at saving money before, but I’m getting a lot better now.   What would you like to do when things are more normal?  I want to see my kids, be around family, and just enjoy being around people. Obviously, I also want to be able to show my face and not have a muffled conversation with folks when I’m working at the restaurant, too.  Are you saving for anything in particular at the moment?   At the start of the pandemic, we didn’t have a car. My mother-in-law’s sister went on a limb and sacrificed so much to get us a car so we could drive to work. She didn’t have to do that, but she did. She and her husband have a nice farm here in Louisiana, and they took me and my husband in. I’m so thankful for their hospitality and want to repay them somehow.   How do you envision your family’s future?  I want us to be in a good place financially, mentally, and physically. Once we overcome this pandemic, I want my kids to grow up and not have to worry about things like wearing a mask. Most of all, I want to get a house for my family and be a full-time mom.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  If I’m being honest, SaverLife literally saved my life. This past May, I was eligible for the  $500 Emergency Response Fund grant . I found SaverLife through the Steady app, and it wasn’t long after that I was scrolling through the  Money 101 articles . I read everything now, from the newsletters to the  Saver Stories . I even told my husband to make a SaverLife account!  "}
{"prompt":"Wolf’s Story: It’s Not About Amassing a Fortune","completion":" Meet Wolf, a retired psychologist living in the mountains of Colorado with his wife and many animals.  What do you do?  My wife and I are retired. We have a small, 35-acre ranch here. We make a little bit of extra money with our goats and chickens. I also contract tutor online. It’s a good way to make a little bit of extra income.  What ups and downs have you had financially?  Our financial struggles happened after we retired. We had everything set up and I do have a pension, but then several things happened. We had a massive windstorm with 150 mph winds. It blew out the windows in our car and home, and it destroyed our solar panels and windmills as well. The storm took our barns and threw them into the woods, too. We were well-insured, but that wasn’t enough to replace everything. Plus, this happened in November, and they couldn’t replace things until June.  Then I was diagnosed with leukemia. I had medical insurance, but it wasn’t nearly enough, and I didn’t qualify for Medicare yet. We had thousands of dollars of medical bills, which just wiped out our savings. And then my pension was cut!  All of that took us from a very good position to a very bad position—all in less than a year in 2011.  I haven’t been healthy enough to work, and my wife has been disabled for a number of years. People don’t realize that within a short period of time, you can be really destroyed financially.  Just this year, we started saving again. That’s eight years where we were just trying to fix all of this. I laugh when I hear advice like, “cut back on coffee and eating out.” We completely cut that out.  The bottom line is that medical insurance doesn’t cover enough. I had three visits to the ICU, and we know that we’re not alone. Many people have been through worse. We’re lucky that our house was paid off and that we have a roof over our heads.   What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My mother was the big financial whiz. She was a school teacher. My dad died when I was 11 years old, but even before that, my mom handled the finances. When she passed away, she left us enough so that we could get the ranch we have now.  She watched everything that she spent. She wasn’t a penny pincher, but she spent deliberately. The only year when she was extremely frugal was the year after my dad died.  As I got older, I started seeing the value in saving. She taught me the importance of having insurance for everything that’s valuable.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?   To set something aside in savings so that you can afford emergencies. Without that, it makes things very difficult. You’re stuck. Our generator recently went out, and we need that as a backup in the winter. We didn’t have savings, so we just had to wait.  I feel very strongly that it’s important to always have something to fall back on.  What’s one thing you know about money now that you wish you knew when you were younger?  That it’s a whole lot easier to save when you’re young than to try to catch up when you’re older. Start saving young, and keep it going.  What are your goals for the future?  Just to be able to build up our savings again. That’s really the main thing. We want to be able to live comfortably, but still afford any emergencies. And as we get older, we know we need that emergency fund more.  We have gotten to the point again where we’re able to do things. We still don’t eat out, but we’re able to eat out.  What does money mean to you in your life?  I don’t put a lot of emphasis on money, except what it takes to be comfortable. I’ve never allowed money to rule my life. It’s important to be able to live comfortably and to be able to take care of your family. It’s a utilitarian thing for me.  I’ve never been into amassing a fortune. And I never will be! "}
{"prompt":"Candice’s Story: Getting Back on Her Feet","completion":" Meet Candice, a Baltimore native who’s looking to get back on her feet after a recent car accident.  What do you do?  Currently, I’m unemployed unfortunately. It happened right after a car accident. Prior to that, I was a medical assistant for four or five years. It’s really been my passion. Now I’m looking to further my education and eventually become a nurse. I’ve been doing some research on accelerated programs, and I’m exploring the different types of nursing careers.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My mom was pretty frugal to say the least. She always taught me to keep certain food and toiletry staples stocked up. Oh, and keep $20 on me at all times just in case.  What are your lowest and highest financial points?  I haven’t really had a highest financial point mostly because when I get to a place where I’m stable, I end up losing close to everything. One example of this was my recent car accident. After the incident, I lost my money-making, full-time job as well as my part-time job. I’m pretty much homeless at this point. However, I can still get into the money saving mindset. When I do have money, I don’t blow it like some people might be tempted to.  When you don’t have a lot of money and all of a sudden start earning a paycheck, the want to spend recklessly is really high.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  I’d say it’s probably making sure all your bills are paid on time and that you have to keep up your good credit.  Don’t live beyond your means is a good one, too. For example, right now as I’m unemployed, it would be ridiculous to trade my car in or get multiple new credit cards. At this point, I just want to make sound financial decisions. I’m trying to be financially conscious, which is why I’m trying to save what I can right now.  What are your goals for the future?  I just want to be more financially stable and prepared. Additionally, it would be great to be financially independent and have multiple streams of income. One of my dreams is to open my own small business. I’ve heard from many people that it’s a lot more work to manage and whatnot, but I like that I can be independent. Right now, I’m just looking to build a foundation for all of it.  Tell me more about your independent business idea.  I’m interested in starting a fashion t-shirt and purse line. Running a business is something that I’d enjoy. Not everyone who has a regular 9-5 enjoys what they do day in and day out and I want to actually enjoy what I’m doing. I’ve had this dream of owning my own business since I worked at Rite Aid at the age of 17.  What’s one thing you’ve bought on sale this year that you’re happy with?  Definitely my car. I was saving up for one when I finally bought one in 2018. It was something I said I was going to do for a while, and I made it happen.  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money makes the world go around. Pretty much, if you don’t have it, you’re out of luck.  Here in Baltimore, the cost of living is constantly going up while the money for income is limited to a certain group of people with high education degrees.   There’s not much financial assistance for those who aren’t disabled or who fit into the typical government assistance programs for the elderly, retired, military veterans, etc. For the regular Joes and Janes that have fallen on hard times, there’s not much financial assistance—or financial education for that matter—to help them get back up and stay up.  How did you feel about winning $50 from the SaverLife Tax Time Pledge?  I was happy about it! I wasn’t expecting it at all! It was a good idea for SaverLife to have this competition.   I actually left the money in my PayPal. I’m saving it for a rainy day for sure. "}
{"prompt":"Garry’s Story: Make a Dollar, Keep a Dollar, Give a Dollar","completion":" Meet Garry, a recent Howard University graduate who runs a freelance photography and videography business in Washington, D.C.  Where’s home for you?  I’ve been living in Washington, D.C. since 2015, but I’m originally from North Carolina. I went to Howard University for film school, where my sister was already getting her Master’s in Film.  What’s your living situation?  I live with one other roommate. It has its ups and downs, especially when it comes to money. I’ve had to get used to depending on someone for rent money. My roommate has been a bit of a liability. Both our names are on the lease, but I’m the master lease holder. He’s about five months behind on his rent.  How are you dealing with his lag?  I’m just trying to keep the landlord happy and make sure my part is paid. I’m holding out hope that he gets a financial boost really soon.  Take me though a typical day in your life.  I’m working full-time for networks right now, and my call time for projects is usually 5am. But my schedule really depends on what network I’m working with, and everything is very dependent on the project. Usually, the days are long no matter what time I start. You have no idea what goes into just getting something on your screen!  I also have my own film and video business on the side. At first I was dependent on the different networks to get me work, but then I thought, “I could just get my own equipment.” Obviously, I don’t have the same caliber of equipment that they do in the studios, but I work with what I have. I’ve worked with different business, models, actresses, and helped film music videos. I’ve been running this for about three years now.  Where do you see your business in five years?  I really want to have more consistent clients. My dream is to have my own film company or streaming service.  What did your childhood teach you about finances?  My parents separated and I grew up with a single mom. Both my mom and dad took time to teach me about money and how hard it was to get money, especially my dad.  When my grandma was alive, she taught me the ins and outs of the flea market. She had her own booth, and when I came of age, I would help her out. I remember around Christmas, I would get all kinds of gifts for my birthday and Christmas because I’m a December baby. For things I didn’t play with anymore, my grandma helped me sell. That was my first taste of being a businessperson. She taught me how to make a dollar, keep a dollar, and how to give it away.  What’s been a time in your life that you’ve felt most financially secure?  Last year I was feeling really secure in terms of my business. I actually got so busy that I had to turn things down. Because it’s all freelance, I was able to do that. There’s really no cap to the amount that I can make, which is great because I can make as much money as I need.  As a recent grad, do you have any student debt?  I’m still within the grace period of loan repayment, but I’ll start paying it back at the end of this year. I’ve been preparing by putting money aside here and there. It’s definitely a big amount that I owe.  I don’t know how much longer the American public can keep this up. Someone needs to forgive the amount of student debt we have as a nation. People leave the world with thousands in debt.  What are your financial goals for the future?  I’m working on getting a house in the D.C. area. I have a three-year-old daughter, and I want her to stay with me whenever she wants to visit since I don’t live with her and her mom. Ideally, I’d like a two-bedroom row house or town house. Something that’s not above the $200k range. I’m hoping to run across a good deal!   What does money mean to you in your life?  Money is a tool to me. That’s about it. I wouldn’t care about it if I didn’t have to exchange it for goods and services. You have to have money to go about your day.  How did you feel about winning $50 from the SaverLife Tax Time Pledge?  It was great! It kind of came out of nowhere, but it was right on time. I’m thinking I could use it for gas. "}
{"prompt":"April’s Story: Wanting Better For Her Son","completion":" Meet April, a single mother who lives with her two-year-old son in Nevada.  How have the last couple of months been?  My son and I have been through a lot, but we’re still patient. I’m trying to do the best I can to provide for him. Things are tough right now because it’s the first time a pandemic has happened in most people’s lifetimes.  How are you taking care of yourself these days?  As much as possible, I stay focused on the positives. My son is two years old and I try to keep him really active so he doesn’t get bored. We try to limit the times we go out, so I’m always thinking of fun things we can do together at home. Family time consists of playing games, coloring books, and teaching sign language to my son. He’s a hearing person, but I’m deaf. I’ve been teaching my son sign language so we can communicate.   What does a day in your life currently look like?   During the day, we chat, play games, watch movies, and spend time together. Sometimes we go to the park because my son really likes to go outside, but it’s hard to find a park nearby that’s open. Actually, a lot of places are still closed. Grocery shopping is our main activity these days. Above all, the most important thing to me is keeping my son safe.  What’s your profession?  I’m not currently employed, but I’m looking for work. I have “momma duty work” right now.  In Las Vegas, there are thousands of people who’ve been laid off. Employment is hard to find around here, so I’m trying to find a job online. I’m not exactly sure what I’m looking for, but I’m actively looking for something to do from home.  Are you able to save these days?  To be honest, saving has been difficult because we’re a low-income family and don’t have a lot of money to begin with. I don’t come from a wealthy family either. I’m trying to save so I can make sure I have something saved up for me and my child.   Has COVID-19 impacted your financial situation?  Yes, it has. A lot of my life has changed dramatically. I’m starting to struggle to keep up with my bills and rent. I’m on a steady financial decline at this time. Right now, I’m looking for programs that could help me out with paying my bills.  Have you had any success in finding any of those kinds of programs?  Fortunately, yes. The  Salvation Army  was a great resource. I’ve also been able to find some Las Vegas-specific programs to help me out with the bills and rent. What I realized is that some of these programs are waiting for people to donate to the organization before they can help those in need.  Tell me how you envision your family’s future.  I want us to live and have a happy future. It would be nice to travel and visit countries like Ethiopia and France. I want to make my son happy as we explore new countries. I’ve never had that opportunity to travel, but I want my son to have those experiences that I didn’t have growing up.  I was raised in foster homes and group homes growing up, so I didn’t have a stable household. I don’t want my son to experience dealing with Child Protective Services because it’s really depressing. He deserves a better environment than what I had.   Did you have a chance to learn about money growing up?  I learned a little bit about saving money during high school, but never had the chance to open a savings account. I didn’t work in high school or have money, and I wish I had some family members who could have taught me about managing my finances.  With my son, I want to teach him about things like budgeting and saving. My hope is that he’ll learn how to manage his money wisely and not spend it all. When he gets older, I’ll teach him about the importance of having an emergency fund set aside.  What does “financial wellness” mean to you?  To me, it means achieving my money goals. My first goal is to start saving $50,000 to get a car. After that, I want to save $50,000 for my son. I want to set him up with an emergency fund.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  It’s AHHH-mazing. I love it. I’ve learned so much from the organization already. With SaverLife’s free financial coaching program, I’ve been able to learn about topics like  debt management ,  saving versus spending , and  budgeting .  "}
{"prompt":"Meet Jonquille, a $1,000 Winner!","completion":" Jonquille lives in Florissant, Missouri with her two sons and works as a billing supervisor. Earlier this year, she pledged to save her 2018 tax refund with SaverLife, then submitted her story about what motivates her to save. We called Jonquille to surprise her with the news that she won $1,000. Check out her reaction!     What did you learn about money as a kid?  I really didn’t. My dad was a postal worker; he carried the mail. My mother was a pediatric nurse practitioner. They didn’t talk much about money. It wasn’t until I got to college and got a credit card when they sat me down to have the talk. But it still didn’t really resonate with me.  Even now, I struggle at times with money. I’ve gotten to the point where I realize that a lot of my money goes to bills. And I don’t like that! I work too hard for my money and I want to travel. I don’t want to be paying credit card bills all the time.  My grandmother said, “Always save for a rainy day.” Back then, they didn’t have credit cards. They just had to save up their money to pay for things. Now it’s all about “swipe, swipe, swipe.” I don’t like that anymore.  We get into this mindset where, if there’s an emergency, we run for our credit card. But now you’re stuck paying for that. If I had saved that money ahead of time, I wouldn’t be stuck paying interest. Because I always know that an emergency will eventually happen. The car is going to break down or some appliance is going to break. It’s not if, it’s when.  Even with my two boys, they have savings accounts now. They know that if they get money for their birthday or for Christmas, they have to put some of that money away.  Have you had ups and downs with money in your life?  Oh yeah. One down was when I had a job change and my pay was cut. I hated being at a point in my life where I was late on bills. Even though I’m a collector, I don’t want to get collections!  This year, it was great to be able to save my tax refund. I didn’t really need it for anything immediately, and I was able to put it away. And that’s something I want to be able to do going forward. When the tax refund comes, your first thought is always, “What am I going to spend it on?” But I’d like to be able to take that commitment that I made this year and save every year going forward.  What does money mean to you?  It means bills! It felt for a long time like all my money was going to bills, and it shouldn’t be that way. I’m getting older now, and I’m in my 40s. I don’t feel like I’m old, but I want to be able to travel. I love to travel.  Growing up, I was an only child, so my parents took me on vacation every year. I haven’t had a chance to do that with my boys. I took them to LA a couple years ago for a week. We went to Venice Beach and Six Flags, and we had a great time. My boys would love to go to New York.

{"prompt":"Week 5 Credit Quiz Results","completion":" Here are the results from our fifth—and last—holiday savings quiz! Scroll through to see what members answered and  take the quiz yourself .  1. I review my credit report at least once a year.   A  study by the Federal Trade Commission  reveals that 1 in 5 people have an error on their credit report. Review your credit report annually, so you do not financially pay for someone else’s mistakes.  2. I pay my bills on time.   On-time payments are one of the most significant factors that impact your credit score. Even being a few days late can raise your interest rate and incur late fees.  3. I know my credit card interest rates and due dates.   Consider contacting your creditor and asking them to lower your interest rate. Some creditors may move your due date, and if you are late, your interest rates can go up, then your creditor may apply late fees to your account.  4. I know how to increase my credit score.   The easiest way to increase your credit score is to make on-time payments. On-time payments account for about 35% of your credit score. Consider setting reminders in your online calendar to pay or set up automatic payments.  5. I am happy with my credit score.   If you aren’t happy with your credit score, you can take several steps to improve it. This involves making on-time payments and limiting how many times you apply for credit. If your low credit score is due to errors,  dispute the errors  to the all three credit bureaus:  TransUnion ,  Equifax , and  Experian .   6. If you miss a payment, how long will the missed payment be on your credit report?   I know you probably feel we are repeating ourselves, but we cannot overstate how damaging even one late payment can be to your credit report. It  stays on your credit report for years  and can impact your ability to get auto loans, a mortgage, and other credit.   7. What are the 5 factors that make up your credit score?   If you are trying to increase your credit score, there are steps you can take without having to hire a credit repair company, but it takes time. Increase your credit score by paying your debts on time, limiting how many times you apply for credit, and only using about 30% of your overall credit limit.  8. How can a low credit score hurt you?   A low credit score can impact your ability to rent or buy a home, get a car loan, or even cell phone service. A low credit score can also cost you money. You may pay more for a mortgage, have a higher-interest car loan, and pay more to turn on utilities.  9. What are the ways you can increase your credit score?   Improving your credit score starts with behavior. It’s paying your bills on time and limiting applications for credit. If you are trying to build credit, consider reporting rent payments to credit bureaus using third party reporting agencies like  PayYourRent.com  or  Renttrack.com  or your utility bills through  Experian  or  TransUnion .  10. Annualcreditreport.com is the only authorized source for the free report that’s yours by law.   Aside from Annualcreditreport.com, some credit card companies and credit monitoring companies may provide free credit reports. Remember to get reports from all three creditors: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Credit bureaus report your credit differently. Once you have your credit reports, consider using a  checklist like Nolo’s  to review your credit check. "}
{"prompt":"David’s Story: Three Members of One Family Survive the Virus","completion":" There are over 110,00 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the city of New York, in every borough. David, his father, and his stepmother are three of them.   David and his family, all highly involved members of their Bronx neighborhood, were hit with the virus weeks ago and are only now beginning to recover–but their lives are still upended by COVID-19. David, a freelance videographer, lost his income when the crisis hit and was unable to buy the essentials he needed to heal, like groceries and medicine. His main client, the Legal Aid Foundation, hasn’t had much work for him since the courts are shut down. David’s stepmother runs a service agency for the disabled, and several of her staff members are unable to work due to illness.   David’s father and stepbrother are both pastors, and with no usual Sunday services, the churches they run have not received their usual donations from members. David and his father were able to secure extensions on certain payments, like insurance and utilities. However, the family remains concerned that they may lose their housing, the parsonage of David’s father’s church. “This is a community of working poor. People are living check-to-check. We’re all out of work, so people can’t give. It’s all up in the air about whether we can continue maintaining the property.”     David has tried to file for unemployment–newly expanded for independent contractors like him during the coronavirus crisis–but there is such high demand that he hasn’t been able to get through. “I applied and spent the next two weeks trying to get through to the phone lines. I have been unsuccessfully trying to finish my application.”   Because there are so many applicants for unemployment, rather than leaving callers on hold, the unemployment office is actually automatically ending calls due to overload. When the unemployment office did finally call back, David wasn’t at his phone and missed the call, leaving him with no recourse but to try again with the same automated system.   On top of the mounting stressors of daily life without income, David is concerned his father may need longer-term, and expensive, medical care. David’s father, who is in his mid-seventies, experienced neurological complications from COVID-19, including two seizures.   David and his family need support to survive the crisis, which could leave them with little to no income for months. With the help of our partners Humanity Forward and Neighborhood Trust, SaverLife was able to disburse a $1,000 payment to David to help him care for himself and his family. David used some of it to cover his groceries and pay his cell phone bill, and he donated half to his stepbrother’s church. “I wasn’t expecting to receive this money, so it felt important to me to share it and distribute it to the community. I am so thankful because, without this, I would be at $0 in my bank account right now,” said David. Now, David has a few hundred dollars to help him cover his basic needs, and so does his stepbrother.   Surviving a serious illness–especially one that hits multiple people in one family–is exhausting and even terrifying. It shouldn’t be financially crippling too. Until David and his family are back on their feet, SaverLife, Humanity Forward and Neighborhood Trust worked together to help David and his community. "}
{"prompt":"Rashala’s Story: Saving Money For Her Daughter","completion":" Meet Rashala, a Youth Development Coordinator for the Boys and Girls Club for America who lives with her daughter in Tennessee.   Tell me about your job.   During the pandemic, we’ve been focusing more on virtual learning. For my role, we’re that means helping the kids out with their school work and teaching them life skills. We recently taught the kids etiquette and how to be kind to people of different backgrounds, religions, and ethnicities.   What does a day in your life currently look like?   I wake up at 6:30 am, make coffee, get my daughter dressed, drop her off at school, then I go to work. After she’s done with school, I pick her up, we eat dinner together, relax, then go to bed and get ready to repeat the process the next day.   When I have time to unwind, I usually read a few blog posts from people I follow, journal a bit, and watch tv.  What did you learn about money growing up?   While I learned a lot about saving money, I wish I could’ve learned about credit, investing, and student loans at an early age.   Also, even though I came from a single-parent household, I never went hungry. And I knew it was a struggle sometimes.    Do you have student loans? What does the payment process look like right now?  The student loan moratorium has really helped. Because I don’t need to pay my federal student loans at the moment, I’ve been able to establish a savings account for my daughter. I’ve also been able to save a couple of months’ worth of income in my emergency fund.   Did you receive both stimulus checks from 2020? What did you do with them?  Yes, I received both. I saved a lot of the first one, and the second one came at a time when I needed to use it for bills.   What does saving look like right now for you?   Saving has been really hard during the pandemic. My hours at work have been tremendously reduced, so I’m making less. I don’t have a lot left over in my paycheck after I pay my bills. But in terms of saving, just knowing that I have a bit of savings has been helpful. It’s what’s been keeping me afloat since my hours were reduced.   How has the pandemic affected your life?  Because the Boys and Girls Club for America has been servicing essential workers’ children, this job has brought me most of my income. On the downside, sometimes we’re shut down due to a COVID-19 exposure. And when I’m at work, I have childcare on my mind. I live in the city by myself and don’t have family around, so I’ve had to rely on childcare facilities and programs for my daughter. I get some financial assistance from the state, but I still have to pay a small portion of the cost of childcare.   Are you saving for anything in particular?   Right now, I’m just trying to save money for my daughter’s future. I want her to be financially prepared for the future—whether that’s college or whatever she decides to do.   Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather the pandemic?   Yes, we’ve had to do that especially since I might be out of work for two weeks at a time. It’s been a blessing to have any savings at all, but when you need to use that money, the tough part is restarting that savings process again.   Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.   Paying off debt increased my credit score. Now when I’m able to pay off more debt than I owe that month, that gives me a chance to only pay the minimum amount next month. "}
{"prompt":"Pashen’s Story: Lessons for My Boys","completion":" Meet Pashen, a Florida native currently living in Lake Wales with her three sons.  What do you do?  I’m a paraeducator at my local school district. I help my students who may have learning disabilities.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  As a kid, I was always worried if my parents were going to be able to pay the bills. It seems like there was never enough money. We’d get these conversations around Christmas about how they couldn’t buy us stuff, but they’d still always try to get us something.   What are your lowest and highest financial points?  Lowest would be when I wasn’t working and had to depend on my three boys’ dad.  My highest was being able to support myself and my three boys on just my income.  Are there any financial hardships you’ve recently overcome?  Trying to make ends meet while living paycheck to paycheck. It seems like with every paycheck, I’m trying not to get a loan or cash advance. I’m trying to see what I can pay, what I can’t pay, what I have to hold off paying.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  To save money and to keep up with my credit score.   What would you tell your 18-year-old self about money?  I would tell myself to save and I’d hope to save every penny.    What are your goals for the future?  Hopefully, making more money and be able to afford a house. We’re currently renting.  What does money mean to you in your life?  To me, it means stability. Money means being able to pay the bills and not worry about things. I want to be able to treat myself or the kids.  What do you hope for your boys’ future?  I’m currently talking to them now about saving and credit. As they go off to college, I want them to understand that no matter how much money they have, they should always save. I want them to have a savings plan for the future. "}
{"prompt":"Janna’s Story: Freedom to Travel","completion":" Meet Janna, a licensed social worker who lives in Texas and loves to travel.  What do you do?  I work for 2-1-1 Texas/UnitedWay HELPLINE, doing outreach and education about 2-1-1 services. I love my work. Every day is different, and there are different topics and coalitions that the community focuses on.  I actually heard about SaverLife through work. It coincided with a time that I really wanted to focus on saving.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I had a very blessed upbringing. We took family vacations. Each summer, we went camping and took an additional vacation.  I grew up with a lot of opportunities, and my parents always made a way to pay for what we were interested in. My brother and I were in sports, and my parents were middle income. But they always found a way to pay for our interests. We did chores and we didn’t have an allowance, but for a special occasion, we could go out to dinner at a pizza place and we could each get a toy at Kmart.  We weren’t indulged, but it was comfortable.   But then my parents divorced when I was in college, and that changed the financial situation a lot. My mom had more of a struggle. I ended up having to take out loans for college because my dad wasn’t willing to pay.  That was a huge shock to have to learn how to make ends meet in college.  My mom dropped me off for college and said, “God may not always give you what you want, but he’ll always give you what you need, and you’re about to learn the difference.”  What have been your highest and lowest financial points?  My lowest financial point was living in an apartment with two other roommates. One roommate and I went to collect aluminum cans because a cold front had come through our college town, and we wanted to buy hot chocolate.  The highest point has been the past couple of years. My salary is higher, and I’m able to redefine what is a “need” and a “want.”  This past year, I’m trying to reset my focus with SaverLife to make sure any extra money goes into savings. A lot of that is the reminders I get from SaverLife.  I really love to travel, and I’d rather this money go toward my savings so that I can travel to places I want to go. For my upcoming 50th birthday, I want to go on a trip – and I want to have all the money saved up before I go so that I don’t come home to debt.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  One that’s so simple is “pay yourself first.” Pay yourself first, put money in your savings, and if your company offers a 401k match, take full advantage of that. That’s free money that you could be leaving on the table. My company matches a good amount of what you put in.  When I was 25 and 26 working at the hospital, I wish I had invested then. It’s never too late to invest and save, but now I am focused on retirement. I don’t want to rely on social security benefits. I work in the community, so I see that a lot of people live on social security, and they have to decide between food and meds.  They say you need a million dollars to retire, and that may not be realistic, but I want to get as close as I can.  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money is financial freedom. I’m able to go do things, go on vacation, weekend retreats, when other friends of mine may not be able to.  I am single, and that is an advantage. Some of my friends with spouses or children struggle more than I do.  What are your goals for the future?  I want to pay off some debt and live debt-free again. I want to focus on savings and having a six-month emergency fund. "}

{"prompt":"Shari’s Story: A Mother and Writer Taking Control of Her Family’s Financial Future","completion":" Meet Shari, a mother in southern California using SaverLife to help her pay down debt while launching her freelance career.   Shari graduated from USC, had a daughter, and launched her career in the midst of the pandemic.   “I never knew childbirth was so expensive,” she said. “It’s almost a year later, and I’m still getting hospital bills from when she was born.”  Shari struggled to find work and childcare as a new mom, eventually realizing she would need a way to earn income from home while caring for her child.   A year later, Shari is working as a freelance writer and was an intern in Snapchat’s Storytelling Program. Her husband is working part-time while in graduate school.   Growing up in foster care, Shari didn’t learn about finance or budgeting.   “I struggled with budgeting all my life,” she said. “SaverLife has been important to help me change that.”  Coming out of school with a baby and student loans, she didn’t think saving was possible.   “I thought, ‘How will I save? I don’t have money!’ But SaverLife inspired me to see the importance of saving. That transformation in my mind of why it was important was really helpful.”   SaverLife also taught Shari how to set up automatic transfers from checking to savings and helped her learn to manage the emotional aspect of spending.   “I’ve learned to plan ahead and be mindful of my spending,” she explained. The ability to win cash prizes and points helped motivate her to keep up a savings habit. “I really like earning points by reading the articles. I like being able to earn while I learn.”  In July 2021, Shari’s family began receiving Child Tax Credit payments, a consistent source of income that helped her plan her family’s finances.   “It helped to be able to plan ahead and budget beforehand,” she said. Her goal is to save $100 a month and use the rest to pay off hospital bills and credit cards.   Shari is  pursuing a career as a freelance writer  and dreams of a strong financial future for her family.   “I envision not having to live paycheck to paycheck, to be able to have an emergency fund and enough money to buy things outside of the necessities,” she said.

{"prompt":"Revisiting Our $5,000 Grand Prize Winner, One Year Later","completion":" Derkisha is a SaverLife member, a nursing school student, and a mother of five.  Last year she pledged to save her tax refund with SaverLife and  won our $5,000 grand prize . We followed up with her to see how her life has changed in the past year.  What’ve you been up to this past year? How’s school?  I’m still at the same house in Texas. I’ve been in school full-time since I won the $5,000 award from SaverLife. After I finish my current six classes, I’ll only have four more left until I graduate. Last semester, I was really proud of myself for getting all As.  We’ll see how this semester goes because I’m taking a Chemistry course. I take both online as well as on-campus classes. I’m excited for the future, but really just excited to get through the next two months that’d be great. When I graduate with my transferable Associate’s degree this summer, I’ll start nursing classes at Texas A&M in the fall. I’m anticipating graduation in June 2022 from my nursing school.  What are you doing when you’re not in school?  In addition to going to school full-time, I work as a housekeeper part-time Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. I do a lot of planning so I’m able to keep track of everything I need to do and get things done. My older kids are all independent and help me around the house with chores. I like being busy.  Also, I’ve been thinking about opening my own business called Teacher’s Helping Hand. I want to focus on single mothers and parents who don’t have time to clean their houses so that they can have time to themselves to relax. I want to get that off the ground.  How are you feeling financially these days?  Financially, we’re good. I haven’t spent that $5,000 award because I still have plans and goals for that. Once I graduate, I really want a house built or at least buy land so I can build my house on it one day. I’ve been in contact with Habitat for Humanity (H4H) in Austin, and they told me the price I have to meet. If I have the opportunity to work with H4H, that’d be great.  I’ve been able to hold onto my savings, and I like the fact that I’m able to take care of my needs without taking out a loan. For example, I was having mechanical issues with my vehicle, and I was grateful to have that cushion to help me.  My siblings and I weren’t taught how to save, and so I’ve had to learn as an adult. I feel a lot more stable and less worried. Being a little more financially stable, it relieves a lot of tension as a single mother going to school full-time and working part-time. I recall not having savings and I was always stressed.  What does your budget look like?  I mainly spend my money on gas, my phone bill, and essentials that we need. Gas is my biggest expense right now. I don’t have to spend a lot because I’m in this transitional housing program. I also eliminated a whole lot of bills before I got here.  I’m working with a group of ladies, and we’re in a class learning the Dave Ramsey curriculum. This’ll help me keep track of budgeting so when I move out, I’ll have the knowledge and tools to have a real budget.   What are your kids up to these days?  My eldest wants to be a veterinarian, and she wants to have pets like a horse, dog, bunny, hamster, and ferret. That’s another reason why we want a big plot of land. My son wants to be a soldier and a policeman. My daughter wants to be a surgeon. We’ve been watching the show The Good Doctor, so that inspired her I think. And the youngest one loves following her sister’s footsteps when it comes to dancing. I’m so blessed to have opportunities like family dance nights with my kids.  I’m not pressing college onto them. If they want to make a business, I’ll support them. I’m not gonna kick them out when they’re 18. I want them to be financially stable first, which is something I didn’t have when I was growing up. I want to help set them up for success.   My sister is my neighbor, so I’m lucky to have that support from her. That’s why I’m able to do what I do. I think a lot of people are missing support when they’re stressed or depressed. I’ve been there before. All the little stuff takes time and energy. "}
{"prompt":"Women Run the (Financial) World","completion":" Financial Tips for Women  Beyoncé had it right. Girls run the world; she just left out the word “financial.”  With Women’s History Month coming to an end, I could think of nothing better than to create a piece for women by a woman. Why would I want to do this?  Women have been paving the way for future generations of women. More than ever before, women are the primary earners or sole earners for their households. Women make most of the spending decisions in their household. Personally, I think this fact alone puts women in a very powerful position. Financial security is the primary goal of money management for women. Although this is also true for men, women place a significantly higher emphasis on that goal.  If you’re wondering how I can take these few things and equate that to women running the financial world, think about it like this. Women are bringing in more income. They are in charge of deciding how to best use the money they or their partners are earning. The decision of whether to spend, save, or invest is falling into the hands of women. Money spent in their community is helping local businesses, and women tend to be more intentional in the businesses they support (woman- or black-owned businesses, for example). Women are doing all of this while keeping the focus on financial security for themselves and their families.  We have power. What can we do with it?  1. Set goals  Think about what financial security means to you. Clearly defining this will bring you clarity so you know exactly what you’re aiming for. The more you can break down this large goal into smaller chunks, the easier it will be to achieve. I think of it as a set of stairs. Nobody levitates up the stairs; we must take it one step at a time. For example, SaverLife member  Gloria  identified having her own place, being in a job for more than a year, and having an emergency fund as financial stability; she was able to pinpoint three separate goals she can start working toward.  2. Budget, track, and monitor  Before spending any of your money, create a  budget . Consider what expenses you must cover and prioritize other spending. Create a plan that will help you easily track your spending, such as using cash for certain expenses. This will help you stay within the budget you set. Monitor your budget to figure out what does and does not work for you on a regular basis. Then revise your plan as needed.  3. Save  Begin saving toward the financial security goals you have identified. Although it may be easy to dismiss saving for emergencies while working toward other financial goals, having an emergency fund is a proven strategy for success. An emergency fund ensures that when an unexpected expense occurs, you have money to overcome the situation. It keeps you from taking away from your other financial goals to deal with the emergency. You never backtrack in your goals when you think of them that way. If you need some inspiration,  Deirdre  explains how she built a $5,000 emergency fund.  4. Negotiate  Women tend to be accepting and appreciative of whatever salary is offered by a prospective employer and are also less likely to ask for a raise. Before simply accepting the pay and terms an employer brings to you, consider whether you should  negotiate your pay . Increasing the amount you bring home could make a big difference in how quickly you achieve financial security, how you prioritize spending, and how quickly you build your emergency fund.

What is one step you are willing to take to harness your power? Write down your answer and put it in your wallet to remind you of your commitment.

{"prompt":"November to Remember Week 4: Share Your Holiday Budgeting Tips","completion":" Here’s what some of our SaverLife members had to say:  “I tend to get carried away wanting to decorate A LOT. I decided I need to just buy a few things each year and then over time I’ll have plenty! For gifts with loved ones, open communication is important and setting cost limits.” – Morgan  on Instagram  “I start saving for the Christmas season 6 months before. I make a list of gifts and the prices and start setting aside for those gifts. Whenever I have lose change I put it in a sealed jar and don’t open it till it’s time to do all the shopping.” – Milissa  on Instagram  “Purchase gifts year-round so you don’t face the dreaded holiday shopping.  Wrap gifts in solid color paper as you buy them. That way, you can use the gifts for “any” occasion. Just dress-up the wrapping for the holidays.

{"prompt":"Here’s How You Can Block an Eviction","completion":" In response to housing insecurity potentially leading to an increase in COVID-19 cases, the CDC issued a nationwide temporary halt in evictions through  June 30, 2021 .   In mid-September 2020, we asked over 500 members if they thought enough was being done to protect people from eviction or foreclosure. We found a large difference between the two groups of renters and homeowners. While homeowners were less worried about foreclosure, renters were 158% more likely to say that they’re concerned about being evicted.  If you or someone you know may be facing eviction, here’s what to do:  Talk to a legal expert regarding this form. The CDC’s eviction moratorium works differently from state to state. But luckily the  American Bar Association  and  Legal Services Corporation  can put you in touch with legal aid near you. Fill out this  CDC declaration , which certifies that you meet the eligibility requirement. Give that form to your landlord and stay in touch with your legal expert. In the meantime, communicate with your landlord. Be upfront about what you can afford to pay while you await the results.  Note :  Be mindful that you are still responsible for paying the rent that you owe at some point. And remember that the eviction moratorium only lasts until June 30, 2021 .  As this  NPR article  points out, “‘The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a historic threat to the nation’s public health,’ says CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. ‘Keeping people in their homes and out of crowded or congregate settings — like homeless shelters — by preventing evictions is a key step in helping to stop the spread of COVID-19.'” "}
{"prompt":"You will NOT lose public benefits because of the Child Tax Credit","completion":" ICYMI (In Case You Missed It)  Stop!

{"prompt":"Nicholas’s Story: Learning the Ways of the Stock Market","completion":" Meet Nicholas, an Amazon delivery person who lives in New York City.  How do you like New York?  I’ve lived in New York City all 22 years of my life. There are so many jobs and public transportation runs 24/7. Though lately, the transit system has been running 20 hours a day instead of all day. It’s not a popular opinion around here, but I think people are better off getting their own vehicle because public transportation always has delays.  What’s your profession?  Right now, I’m doing deliveries for Amazon and I’ve been doing so for the last three years. This has always been a weekend type of thing, and it’s always come in handy during times like this. I had another job in the past, but I was laid off due to COVID.   I also do focus groups and surveys online during the week whenever possible. The little extra income is nice.  Walk me through a day in your life.  Recently, I got into following the stock market. I already live on the East Coast, so it’s easy for me to wake up before 9am and look at the daily news and how it influences the market. From 9am to 4pm, I stare at the screen and the market going up and down. Of course, I shower and brush my teeth in between.  On the weekends, I go to my Amazon delivery job, come home, rest, and prepare myself for the next day.   Tell me more about your experience with watching the stock market.  It was good until today. I watch the numbers go up and down throughout the day. I’ve been day trading, and I discovered that it’s a lot more expensive than just investing. I learned that I’ll have to save more money for taxes next year. Right now, I’m learning about tax deductions and what I may qualify for.   Day trading is just a lot more riskier than normal “set it and forget it” investing. One day you could make thousands of dollars, and the next day you could be back at square one. I saw the gains people were making and thought, “Maybe I should give it a try.”  How are you and your family coping with what’s going on?  We’ve been collecting unemployment and saving as much as we can with the funds that the state offers.  What was it like filing for unemployment?  Compared to my parents, filing for unemployment was easier for me because I had W-2s through my job. My parents are both self-employed, so the process was more difficult for them. The government asked for documents they didn’t have.  Other than that, I claimed late and it made me regret not filing for unemployment earlier. I was supposed to get my shift job back in June, but then I got laid off, so I didn’t start collecting until after I was officially laid off.  I didn’t know that you could still work while collecting unemployment insurance. So, right now, I can work and also receive unemployment insurance, but I get a reduction on the amount of funds I’d receive.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  Yes, I have. I had to dip into my savings before I filed my unemployment claim and started receiving unemployment insurance.   What’s your proudest financial achievement?  I’m starting to manage my money better nowadays. I used to have issues with spending.   Since the pandemic started, I’ve been making more money online doing surveys and participating in focus groups. In fact, I now make more in supplemental income online than I do from my regular weekend job. The additional money I’ve earned has been helping me save more and invest. I don’t know what jobs there might be in the future, and it’s nice to have some savings on the side.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It means financial freedom. To me, money is happiness. I can achieve happiness when I put my money to good use.  I had student loans, and I was able to pay it off using the unemployment insurance I received. I didn’t have to stress about that debt anymore.   How do you feel about SaverLife?  It’s a great website that gives you many financial topics to look at. The site definitely helped me save money, and it’s how I discovered investing. I like the $5 you could win with Scratch & Save.  "}

{"prompt":"Greg’s Story: A Veteran Planning for the Future","completion":" Greg is a veteran who lives in Danville, NY and works for the New York Army National Guard. He was selected as one of our 2020 Super Saver of the Year finalists. However, when he was growing up, savings was not a topic of conversation.   “I grew up in a poor family,” Greg said. “There was barely money to live off of. Every time I got money, I spent it.”  As an adult, Greg developed addictions to gambling and drinking. He accrued more than $20,000 in debt and was living paycheck to paycheck. Getting divorced was a wake-up call.   “One day I said, ‘I can’t do this anymore,’” Greg said. “I hit rock bottom.”  Greg stopped gambling and tried to curb his impulse spending. He saw an ad for SaverLife on Penny Hoarder and decided to join a  savings challenge . Before taking the challenge, he’d barely had a savings account, but over the six months of the challenge, he slowly began to build his savings. Over the last six years, he’s continued to save and learn about personal finance.   “It’s still a struggle but I try really hard to save money,” he said.    Greg paid off most of his debt by selling things he owned. He enjoys reading the  member stories  on SaverLife’s website and participating in  Scratch & Save .   “SaverLife opened a new path to start a journey of saving money,” he said. “It’s evolved me into becoming a better person at saving money.”  Greg encourages the soldiers he works with at the New York National Guard to use SaverLife to help them build their own financial security.   In December 2020, Greg won $1,000 as part of SaverLife’s first annual Super Saver of the Year competition. He plans to put the money in savings. He hopes it will provide a cushion in case a financial emergency arises.   “I’m just going to sit on it for a while,” he said. “It’s relieving.”  "}
{"prompt":"6 Tips for Protecting Your Personal Information Online","completion":" It’s that special time of the year again – tax time! With the conveniences of the digital age, there are many useful online tools to help you file your taxes. However, there are also sites that will try to gain access to your Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  Here are some tips and practices to help you protect your information.   Make sure the website is secure  Most browsers will notify you that a website is not secure. The warning tells you that any data that you put into the website (including credit card information or passwords) could be captured by a 3rd party. Avoid entering any information on these websites that may compromise your PII! If you receive a link you can identify an insecure website by seeing if the URL starts with HTTP instead of HTTPS. The S at the end denotes the website is using a form of encryption.   A secured website will display a lock next to the URL in the address bar of your website.   Avoid phishing scams  Scammers are getting more creative in how they present emails and messages to imitate a legitimate organization. Always closely inspect the URL and sender address of any email that is requesting your PII. Instead of clicking links or attachments within an email, you should log directly into the official company website to determine if any action is needed.  Most reputable organizations will openly display their official support email. If you’re having trouble with your SaverLife account, for example, you can contact us at help@saverlife.org. If a URL is different from what the organization generally uses (for example Saverlife.xn instead of SaverLife.org), avoid clicking the link.   Reach out to  support  if you’re concerned about a suspicious email.   Create strong and unique passwords  One of the easiest ways for hackers to access your PII is through a phishing scam. This is where a scammer impersonates a company to get you to enter your username and password.  If one of your accounts is compromised, you can mitigate the amount of access they have to your information by having different passwords on your other accounts. A password generator such as LastPass or KeePass can help you generate complex and unique passwords for every website you use.  Set up multi-factor authentication  Multi-factor authentication makes it harder for hackers to compromise your accounts. If your account is compromised, multi-factor authentication can also notify you that someone is attempting to log into your account. Most two-factor authentication methods today use your phone as the secondary device. You will be alerted immediately whenever your accounts are accessed without your permission.  Never provide your full bank, credit card, or social security number to support  If you need to provide a form of identification to a support inquiry, you should only need to give the last 4 digits. Most teams will have access to the last 4 numbers of your account or identification number. Providing a full number is only inviting unnecessary risk!  Use anti-virus protection  Most anti-virus protection now offers services and features that detect malicious web activity on the websites you visit and notify you. Free options include AVG and Avast.

{"prompt":"Andrew’s Story: The Pursuit of a Minimalist Lifestyle","completion":" Meet Andrew, a recent newlywed living in Daly City, CA with his wife and their 13-year old son.  What do you do?  I work for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission in the Water Resources Department. I’ve been at this position for a little over three years, but I’ve been with the company for over eight years.   What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My dad was pretty good about finances. He was the one who taught me about saving, investing, and making savings a part of your paycheck. I learned a lot of good money habits from him. Now I’m all about living debt free.  Can you tell me more about your commitment to living debt free?  I was a bit of a consumerist in college. I got a credit card when I was a freshman, and I was racking up debt buying stupid things. When I was a junior, I had what seemed like a mountain of debt. Around 2006-2007, my roommate and I stumbled upon some articles on minimalism. It took a few years, but we finally both got out of debt. It helped with spending and keeping things under control and really figuring out what’s important in life.  What’s your advice for people looking to adopt a minimalist lifestyle?  For me, anytime I make a purchase – especially a big purchase – I ask myself if it’s going to improve my life. Make sure you have the money for what you buy and you’re not buying frivolous things. Know what you value in life. For me, that’s experiences over material things.   Living within your means is harder than it sounds. When you’re working and making money, you have lifestyle creep and you’re trying to keep up with Joneses. Once you adopt a lifestyle where you’re not spending a lot of money, it gets easier. Be intentional with your money and time. Everything is valuable commodity and you don’t want to waste anything needlessly.  What have been your lowest and highest financial points?  My lowest was definitely when I graduated because I had consumer and student loan debt. I had a job lined up after college, but the recession hit right after I graduated and things took a turn. Unemployment benefits helped me survive for a bit. The grace period for student loan payments was ending, and I knew that I owed somewhere between ten and fifteen thousand dollars.  I achieved my highest point probably a few years later when I paid off all of my debt. I could see my entire paycheck coming to me instead of paying all my debtors. I was able to max out my 457b and my Roth, and I had a fully funded emergency fund.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Honestly, it is just living beneath your means. It’s kind of cliché, but I don’t think many people do that. Realize that you can still live a good life while saving and investing. It’s all about balance. You don’t want to be saving so hard and you could die tomorrow. Finding that balance is crucial.  You’re saving and investing for your future but remember that money is just a tool that you need to live. Don’t penny pinch all the time and not enjoy what life has to offer.   What does money mean to you in your life?  I definitely think it’s a tool and not the end all be all. Money itself doesn’t make you happy, but it can help you feel more secure. If you don’t have money, you’re just constantly going to worry about it.  If you have an emergency fund, you can breathe a little easier. For instance, our son broke his collarbone a month before my wife and I got married. Just knowing we had money to pay out of pocket after insurance helped.  What are your savings goals?  So now that I’m married, I think getting on the same page about finances is important. We do have a little bit of debt now. My wife has a car note and our goal is to pay that off soon. We’d also like to beef up our emergency fund. "}

{"prompt":"Gloria’s Story: A Path Toward Financial Stability","completion":" Meet Gloria, an aspiring pharmacy technician who lives with her five children in Minnesota.  Tell me more about you and your family.   In my house, it’s me and my five kids. They range in age from five months to 12 years old. We’ve been living in Saint Louis Park since June of this year. Right now, my days consist of taking care of my kids and trying to keep us all safe from COVID. We don’t go out unless we really, really have to. We’ve been more isolated these days.  What does going back to school look like for your older children?  They’re doing distance learning this fall, but we’ll see if that changes. I’m okay with their school situation since it’s probably safer for them to stay at home. They had a taste of what distance learning would be like since their school made the transition to go virtual earlier in the spring. We’ll see how things go when they eventually go back to school on campus.  Any current aspirations?  I’d like to be more stable in life. To my family and me, “stable” means many things: having a place of our own, a job where I’ve worked more than a year, and some sort of emergency savings set up. I don’t want to waste any more money.  I haven’t been saving the money that I do receive. Instead, I’ve been spending it. It’s harder right now to save because I don’t have any income coming in.   Tell me about your dream job.  I want to be a nurse. My kids actually inspired me to pursue that dream. When they were sick, I liked helping them get well. I started going to school to be a pharmacy technician, but it got to be too much with taking care of the kids and going to school.  What are you most looking forward to when the pandemic is over?  First, I’d like to find another stable job and do that for awhile. Then, I want to start going to pharmacy technician school again part-time.   Do you have any short-term or long-term savings goals?  I’d like to save at least $100 or $200 a month to start. I’m not saving for anything in particular right now. It’d be nice to have some amount of money saved up at all.  Did you learn about money growing up?  I learned how to balance a checkbook, but that’s about it. Nowadays, I want to teach my kids the things that I didn’t learn about growing up such as budgeting. When they get their own jobs, I want them to learn good spending habits like only buying what you need instead of spending money on whatever they want.  What does budgeting look like for you?  There is no budgeting right now during this pandemic. Everything I had saved up, I’m spending on things I need for my kids.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I found out about it through an app I was using. It seems like a helpful tool! "}

{"prompt":"Jessica’s Story: SaverLife’s Grand Prize Winner of the Bluefield Story Contest","completion":"    Meet Jessica, a customer support representative who lives with her husband and two daughters in Virginia.  Jessica was the $5,000 Grand Prize Winner of the Bluefield Story Contest.  Even though the SaverLife team couldn’t meet her in person, we were grateful for the opportunity to congratulate her virtually. Normally, we go out to our winners and actually surprise them in person with a check, but we couldn’t do that given the travel advisories. So we did a Zoom call instead!   Where did you grow up?   I grew up in Honaker, Virginia. It’s a small town about an hour from Bluefield. We weren’t poor poor, but we were pretty poor. We didn’t really have a lot, but I had a good childhood—just didn’t have what other people had.  Can you talk about your financial upbringing?   I remember little things like yearbook day, where you take your yearbook in and get your classmates to sign it. I never got one because we couldn’t afford it. My senior pictures and class ring were also too expensive. I had to borrow a cap and gown to graduate. I also didn’t get a car on my 16th birthday. When I got older, I realized that I didn’t want my kids to ever have to miss out on any of that stuff. I’ve been working since I was old enough so I could give them a better life.  What do you and your husband do?   He works for JS Construction. They build houses and do roofs and things, and then he does work on the side. On his days off, he’ll go fix roofs.  And then I work at Alorica for Mint. I do chat support. If someone needs help with their account, I can help them with troubleshooting. I’ve been here probably six or seven months. I’m blessed to be able to work still with the COVID-19 lockdown going on. I worked at a call center previously and then when one opened in Bluefield, I was really excited. So far, it’s been great! The teamwork is amazing. I love it.  How is the working from home going for you with your family there?   It was hard at first because the kids wanted to play while I was working and I’d have to say, “No, you can’t be in my room during these hours.” But they like having me here at home even if I can’t be next to them.  What did you like about SaverLife?   I’ve never been one to save. I’ve wanted to, but I just never could save. Our HR representative sent a notification out about SaverLife and suggested we sign up for the program. I did, and it made saving so fun! I’ve never seen anything like that before. Usually, I dip into my savings, but I’ve actually left it alone.  There’s lots of tips on there. I’d read through on how to save, especially with COVID-19 going on. Then there’s the savings challenges like the Races to $100 that you guys have. You track it and actually see where you’re at as far as how much you saved. I really like it.  Have you been participating in Scratch & Save?   I just started because I have direct deposit set up, so I have $50 a week going into my savings account. My husband and I are both working now, and while we’re not rich by far, it just makes me feel better knowing that I have some money in there. I have something saved in case an emergency happens or anything can happen.  Plus, I wanna teach my girls about money, too. Ever since they were little, they’ve seen me work. They know that you have to work for what you want to get in life, and then you need to save because you never know what tomorrow might bring.  What was it like finding out on TV that you’d won $5,000?   I was shaking like a leaf on a tree, I’m telling you! When I was interviewed, the news person asked if I knew why I was there. I said, “I’m a finalist for this story contest.” Then she said, “Well, you’re not just a finalist.” My heart started beating and then she grabbed that check and turned it around. I started crying. It was amazing. That was the best day ever.  Honestly, I didn’t think I was a winner because I didn’t want to get my hopes up. I was thinking, “Maybe there are five finalists?” Nothing good like that ever happens to me, so I was really surprised.  What are you planning to do with the money that you won?   I’m going to put some of it back in our savings account to get a head start on saving now that I can. Then I’ll probably take the girls and get them some clothes and let them pick something out. Maybe go out to eat or something whenever restaurants open back up.  Also, the house we live in now was where my husband grew up, and we’re wanting to buy it back. We’re hopefully going to save and do that eventually. He has a lot of memories here.  What does winning mean to you?   I’m speechless. It means more than you guys will ever know. That is gonna help us so much. We work, but it’s hard to save when you have bills upon bills upon bills. This is gonna give us something to put in our savings account. I’m forever grateful to SaverLife.  Do you know how much you’ve saved since you’ve signed up for SaverLife?   I think I’ve saved about $179. I just started a month ago. Like I said, I just recently started doing direct deposit.  What did you learn about money as a kid?   Honestly, to cherish it. I didn’t have a lot of it growing up. It was always government assistance and whatnot. And I mean, there’s nothing wrong with that, but I was determined to be different, to make a different life.  I was in and out of group homes and foster homes most of my childhood. So, having a home and family is more important to me than any dollar amount could ever be.  It’s little stuff. Even if it’s something like school pictures or yearbooks, we make sure they get them just so they’ll have those memories. Our school is closed for the rest of the year, so the memories will definitely be treasured.  What does money mean to you in your life?   Family to me is more important. Don’t get me wrong, I like having money, but if you have it, save it. Like I said before, you don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.  When have you felt most financially comfortable?   Right now. Just knowing that my husband and I both work and we don’t have to depend on the government to help or anything like that. We are really self-sufficient and that means more to me than anything in this whole entire world. I’m not knocking government assistance because I grew up with it, but I wanted to be self-sufficient. I wanted to be able to take care of myself and my own.  Have you had ups and downs with money in your life?   Oh yeah, absolutely. Before, I could never save. The minute I got money, it was gone. I never valued it, I guess. And then I’ve always worked, but I didn’t save money. I would pay my bills and take care of my kids, but I didn’t save anything. The older I got, the more I realized that you have to. You have to think about the future. Not just for me, but for my kids.   What’s been a low point for you financially?   I was homeless at one point and living in a car with my two kids.  I ended up staying with a friend. And when my husband and I moved in together, we got ourselves a little apartment and were literally sleeping on wooden floors while our girls had a bed. We just had blankets on the wood floors—no furniture, nothing. All we had was the car, the kids’ beds, and clothes. From there, we started building a life, and I think we’ve done pretty good for ourselves considering.  It seems like it. How has your life changed since you started saving?   I’m not as anxious. I can just sit back and breathe a little. If something happened tomorrow, we would be okay for a little bit. It’s nice to know that it’s there if we need it.  What’s your favorite thing about SaverLife?   I’m a competitive person, so I’m like, “If this person can save $100, then I’m going to save $150,” and it ends up being good for me. It makes saving fun. That’s the biggest thing. I actually shared SaverLife on my Facebook. I’ve told everybody. I’m like, “Get on there, it’s fun.”  What are your hopes for your daughters?   That they see that even though life hasn’t always been easy, I tried, and I did it all for them. I wanna know that they’ll be okay and see what it’s like to work for things you need and want. And that you need to save and be a good person. I just want them to be okay.  I want them to look back and say, “When I was younger, my mom worked her rear end off. She did what she had to do to take care of us, and now we know how to work and save and make it.” As long as they’re proud of me, that’s all that matters.  How would you describe SaverLife to a friend?   Amazing and fun! You get a lot of information. In addition to the website being fun, you do actually get savings tips and stuff.

{"prompt":"Week 2 Budgeting Quiz Results","completion":" Here are the results from our second holiday savings quiz! Scroll through to see what members answered and  take the quiz yourself .  1. I use a budget to manage my spending monthly.   A budget is your plan for how you will spend your money. A budget can also help you plan for how much money to save monthly to help you reach your savings goals. There are plenty of budgeting apps to help you budget. Read  What apps do you recommend to track your spending habits?  for suggestions on choosing a good budgeting tool that works for you.  2. Before I buy something, I carefully consider whether I can afford it.   We all have busy lives. A budget reminds us of upcoming expenses so we don’t overspend.   3. I feel like my spending is under control.   If you feel that your spending is out of control, consider creating a budget. A budget is far more than a set of numbers on a spreadsheet. A budget helps to give you boundaries to keep your spending under control. For instance, if you struggle with clothing, giving yourself a certain amount to spend on clothing gives you limits on your spending.  4. I know how to create a budget.   If you know how to create a budget, great! Every quarter, do a review to make sure that your budget truly accounts for your spending. If you struggle to create a budget, read  6 Steps To Creating the Perfect Budget . This article walks you through a step-by-step process for creating a budget.  5. It’s hard to stick to my budget when unexpected expenses arise.   If you are struggling to budget for unexpected expenses, review your budget to make sure you are accounting for all expenses, not just bills. Also make sure that your budget is realistic. If you have a family of 6, a $100 grocery budget may not be realistic. For more tips to help you stick to your budget, consider reading  5 Reasons Why You Can’t Stick to A Budget and How to Fix It .  6. What types of expenses should be in your budget?   A budget should cover more than you bills. It should account for all spending like school activity fees or holiday spending.  7. Why is it important to budget?   Budgeting helps you stay current with monthly expenses and plan for future expenses so you don’t go into financial shock over upcoming expenses.  8. What are some ways to help you save more money?   The best way to save money is whatever method keeps you consistent. If you’re worried about being disciplined enough to save, or busy, then consider doing automatic deductions from your paycheck or bank account. Train yourself to transfer to have a savings mindset by committing any extra money—whether it’s from cutting back on an expense or a tax return to savings.  Take the holiday quiz for yourself! "}
{"prompt":"Mercedes’s Story: Changing her Students’ Lives","completion":" Meet Mercedes, a high school special education teacher who lives in Bridgeport, CT.   Tell me about your profession.  Well, I originally didn’t plan to be a teacher. A few years back, I completed a year with AmeriCorps. I loved the opportunity to be that positive role model for students, which is what inspired me to go back to school and earn my certificate to teach English.  My boss said that I should look into getting a degree in Special Education, which is what I did. I love getting to be a special education teacher because it’s about empowering students and their families.   What does a day in your life look like?  I wake up, get dressed, have breakfast, go through my classes, check-in with my students, and then check in with teachers.  After school is done, I run a girls’ mentoring program. We’re actually talking about financial literacy next, so I’m excited to share SaverLife’s  Money 101 articles  with them.   How’d you get started with your school’s girls’ mentoring program?  I was voluntold to run it. The kids chose me to lead their group. It was originally only for upperclassmen, but now girls from all four grades are involved.   It’s about bringing the upperclassmen and lowerclassmen together to have important conversations with one another. For me, it’s all about giving back. I’m happy that they like the topics we talk about.   How has COVID-19 impacted your job?  After four years of teaching, this year was the hardest. My students really didn’t like online classes. It was hard for them to be on their own and not have someone monitor them. It’s also been really hard to teach from home because I couldn’t get the kids as motivated or engaged over video calls.  The pandemic took a toll on what education looked and felt like. I was able to realize how fulfilling it was to teach classes in person.  As the pandemic went on, some of my students would be “attending” my online class while they were at work, and some completely gave up. Actually, some students chose to be homeschooled until they could go back to school in person.   At the end of the day, I just wanted to make sure that I could help my kids and make sure they graduate.  Could you share more about how you use our articles in your classroom?  In our school’s consumer math class, there were a number of students who struggled to grasp some of those concepts. These students had projects about saving money, picking a career, and making a budget. It was like pulling teeth with some of these kids to get their projects done.  After my aunt introduced me to SaverLife, I started sharing the Money 101 articles in class and we’d read them together. Then, I could see things start to click for these kids.   SL helped me share real-life examples of financial situations that they’ll experience in life. The articles are full-proof. They’d end up talking to each other about money management afterward.  One thing I realized throughout this process is that we don’t talk about college planning until they’re a senior in high school. How do first-generation students understand long-term investments, choosing a career, taking on student loans, etc.?  I firmly believe that we should start having these conversations sooner. In Connecticut where I teach, we have the biggest achievement gap in the nation. I want to help my students be independent and learn how to manage their money.   Can you tell me about a time you struggled with your finances?  My first year of college was tough because I didn’t have a job and didn’t realize how expensive textbooks were. Also, if my friends wanted to go off campus, I didn’t have money for that.   The first semester was a pivotal moment in my life. After I got a job, I started an emergency fund. But it still felt like I was going through this cycle of attending class, going to my job, going out with friends, and then not having money left.  What do budget and saving look like?  In the beginning, both saving and budgeting were hard for me. Now, I create a budget spreadsheet every month. These days, my goal is to save at least 20% of each paycheck.   I look at my income from teaching and tutoring, and at the end of each week, I look through my purchases and see if there’s anything that I can return. Impulse purchases are my weakness.   I was actually reading this  article from SaverLife about making SMART goals . After reading the article, I literally made a goal for the income I make from teaching.  Are you paying student loans right now?  I’m not paying my student loans right now because I just graduated after earning my Master’s in Special Education last week. So I still have some time before the repayment process starts. I really believe teaching is an undervalued profession.  Who knows? Maybe Dr. Jill Biden will be able to help raise awareness that teachers need to be paid more.  Have you received a stimulus payment? Do you recall what you do with the money?  I was fortunate enough to have received all the stimulus payments. A lot of it went toward paying off my credit cards. Any excess money after that went to fixing my car as well as savings.  How did you find SaverLife?  My aunt is a preschool teacher and she stays very engaged with her students’ parents. SaverLife was one of the websites that she recommended to her parents, and she recently shared your website with me.  I like that I get  rewarded with points and badges  for reading the articles. It’s really helpful for me. I also like that you can read  other people’s stories .   Are you saving for anything in particular?  Well, I’d love to pay off my mortgage and just get a new car. I’m just saving for emergencies now.   Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  My biggest achievement was definitely paying for my used car in cash. "}

{"prompt":"Heather’s Story: Helping Her Community Deal With COVID-19","completion":" Meet Heather, a hospice nurse who lives with her husband and two girls in Colchester, Vermont.   Tell me about your job.   I’m a registered nurse (RN) at Bayada Hospice, where we support five counties in the state of Vermont. Right now, I have 12-18 clients of my own. While I’m thankful for a steady job and income, I’m working 50-70 hours a week. Last week was particularly hectic because both flu and COVID-19 are on the rise in our counties.   I’m supporting people in their homes as well as those living in nursing homes. Those in hospice don’t get to see their families, and it’s gotten even worse with COVID-19. In the beginning of the pandemic, I wasn’t even able to see my own family because I was dealing with COVID-19 patients.   What does a day in your life currently look like?   At 6:30am, I wake up the girls before feeding our two dogs and one cat. Then I help my oldest get ready for online school by making sure she has everything she needs before she starts her day. After I drop my youngest off at school, I head to work. Since I cover five counties, I can drive up to 200 miles a day. I arrive back home around the same time that my husband and two girls do, and sometimes I bring my work home with me. After dinner, we’ll usually watch a movie together to wind down.   “My side hustle is the same as my job. I work extra hours as a hospice nurse for Bayada Hospice if I need the extra money. There is always more work, especially in these times of trial. I get to bring joy and the gift of comfort to families at the end of their loved one’s life. Rewards abound and my cup of gratitude and peace to be able to do what I do and get paid for it is a blessing.”   Can you tell me more about your financial situation?  My husband was on layoff in December, and he was supposed to go back in March, but that’s when the company furloughed him until May. He went back to work in May, but now we’re looking at him potentially getting furloughed in December.  When I took on my current position, it was fantastic and we were finally getting back on our feet. A year and a half ago, I lost my job at a different hospice facility. My previous job decided to give me double hours (80 instead of 40) with half the pay. And in August of this year, we had to file for chapter 13 bankruptcy. We almost lost our house because of the pay cut I took last year. We’ll have fully paid off our debt in two and a half years, but it’s a struggle to pay that in addition to other bills. We’re pretty much relying on my husband’s paycheck at this point because my paycheck covers our bankruptcy. You can do everything right and then sometimes things just go wrong.   There’s a federal moratorium on student loans until December 31, 2020. How prepared do you feel to start paying them again in the new year?  I started out with $100,000 and I’ve been able to work my way down to $65,000. Most of my student loans fell under the moratorium, but I’m still paying toward my private student loans. Once the moratorium ends and I have to start paying my federal student loans again, I know my budget will be tight, but it’s something that needs to happen. Right now, I pay about $400 in student loans every month.   Since the moratorium was put in place, I’ve been putting the money I would have been using for my federal loans toward our mortgage.  What does this school year look like for your family?  There were two active COVID cases from one family at my daughter’s school and neither of them wants to go back in-person. My oldest suffers from anxiety and she had a two hour panic attack last week; she refused to go to school. She only goes to school in person two days a week, but even that’s tough. This morning, our youngest daughter woke up and told us she didn’t want to go to school.  It’s a constant battle. Online school is a nightmare and we have constant talks with the teachers and staff about assignments that are lost and not getting done. My husband and I don’t know what’s right anymore. The hybrid model isn’t working, limited in-person classes aren’t working, and obviously online schooling isn’t working. I know kids need in-person learning, but I also know that that’s the best way to potentially contract COVID-19 other than getting it from me since I work in healthcare.  I think the world is just so anxious right now. They just moved our school district up to full capacity for classes. The teachers are not being tested for COVID-19 because there’s no requirement for it. There’s just a lack of testing happening in the state of Vermont.  Do the holidays look different for you this year?  Typically, I get to see my family. My sister and her two girls (my nieces) live in red zones (out of state), so they won’t be able to come celebrate the holidays with us this year. I’ve seen very few family members over the past year. But if COVID-19 cases continue to rise like they have been, I don’t think we’ll be able to keep seeing each other. We may have to have “Zoom holidays” like we did in the spring. For Easter this year, we had to celebrate over FaceTime.   What would you like to do after this is all over?  We canceled three family vacations this year, so we want to make up for that time. This fall, we were supposed to go to a friend’s wedding in Connecticut, but we’re missing it because of travel restrictions and the fact that I’d have to quarantine for a month when we returned. We take a yearly trip to the Maine sea coast to Wells Beach, but we can’t go this year. Unfortunately, we had to cancel our trips to Las Vegas and Niagara Falls, too. It was going to be our first time seeing the waterfalls. And we try to make our way to Orlando every couple of years to see my father, but obviously we had to push that out, too. I feel like we just wasted an entire summer. My kids couldn’t go to the beach, out to restaurants, or see their friends.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I signed up for SaverLife a couple of years ago, and I’ve loved it ever since. In the past, I’ve won $50 from a contest, $5 from a  Scratch & Save card , and I recently received one of the $500  Emergency Response Fund  grants. The cash grant came just in time because we received the money right when my husband got the news that he’d be furloughed.  "}
{"prompt":"Laurynn’s Story: How to be a Blessing to Others","completion":" Laurynn is a non-profit founder and daycare owner who lives in Central Florida with her two daughters.  How do you like living in Florida?  I honestly love it. I’ve been here for about three years, and I don’t see myself living anywhere else. The heat took some getting used to, but I usually stay inside with the AC on anyway. It’s definitely home for my two daughters and me. Besides my daughters, I’m surrounded by the family that I’ve made here. I’ve created some serious bonds since moving here with my two girls and that’s another reason why Florida is home.  What do you do for a living?  So I have multiple professions, but my main source of income is from the daycare I own. I’m also the founder of a non-profit, a notary, and an author of two books. I’d definitely consider myself a busybody. I’ve learned you have to wear many hats to survive.  Tell me about your favorite hat to wear.  I have two: my non-profit and the daycare I run. I’m passionate about both, and they’re equally important to me.  With the non-profit, it’s small, but I feel like it’s my mission to help people. It started with a food pantry beside my mailbox. I felt called to bridge the gap of hunger in my neighborhood. I thought to myself, “This is helping someone put food on their table.”  The daycare allowed me to raise my own children, which is the main reason I started it in the first place. It makes me very happy.  Could you tell me about the two books you’ve written?  The first one I wrote when I was very young. I talk about my experiences as a child and finding my way in life. And the second book is a collection of poetry.  What does a day in your life currently look like? How is your family coping with what’s going on?  Busy, busy, busy. I wake up at the crack of dawn. As a single mom of two daughters who are four and three years old, I have to start my day early. For my daycare, I’m not only serving my children, but other people’s children as well. I teach the children I care for. I participate in virtual prayer with my church at 7am. From the time my feet touch the floor when I wake up, I’m serving others, I’m planning, working on projects and developing things within myself.  I’m always busy with something. There’s never a day where I’m not exhausted by 12pm. Sometimes, I even feel guilt trying to sneak a nap in. I can get so caught up in helping others that I forget to do things for myself, like eat. I’m a very passionate person. Anything that I’m involved in, I’m giving it my everything.  In your  June Journaling  post, you mentioned helping others. What does that look like for you right now?   Each month, I put aside 10% for tithes for my church and $50 for charitable giving such as giving money to homeless people. I’ve made some changes because everyone I know, or even don’t know, is struggling. For example, I know many people are still waiting to receive unemployment. More people are getting food from the pantry I have set up, so I know they need help. I thought to myself, “If someone can’t feed their children today, I’m gonna have faith and I’m gonna help them get food for the week.” It’s a blessing to be able to bless others.  I was a little more prepared than most people. At the beginning of the lockdown, I had enough savings to last for two months. I was able to get extensions on a few of my debts, so this decreased my monthly debts temporarily. I still paid my tithes accordingly, but I decided that $50 a month for charitable giving wasn’t enough. So I increased the amount to $100. Very recently, I was able to help a family out that wasn’t able to pay their bills, get groceries. They’re still facing eviction. I’m struggling too, but I’m not in the position that they’re in, so I helped them. I could think only of my children and I and the months ahead, or I could recognize that as of today, I have abundance and can bless someone else if I just released some of what I was blessed with. Every dollar that I’ve released to bless someone else, I’ve been able to get it back with an increase in due time.  What or who inspired you to be a blessing to others?  Christ. I’m a Christian. Part of being a Christian is walking that walk and helping others. It’s hard to say you love Christ if you aren’t loving others. What launched me into serving others before myself has been my spiritual walk.  I learned that when it comes to helping others, it’s not shoes that you take off and put back on when you’re ready. You’re always on that walk. From interacting with my children to talking with my neighbors, it’s just a part of life.  Are your kids in school?  My daughters are homeschooled. My four-year-old will be starting kindergarten this year, and she’ll be in online classes. Even though she’ll be taught online, I’m going to be her learning coach. I want to give her her wings and let her flap them a bit.  I’ve always wanted to homeschool my children and establish their foundation here at home. For my oldest, she’s already got her schedule down. She’s actually learning Spanish and sign language at home. I enjoy teaching my children, but I decided to let them get a break from me and have a different academic teacher. I want my children to learn many teaching styles and socialize with other adults in a different environment.   It sounds like you and your daughters have a great relationship. Can you tell me more about them?  So my oldest is definitely a deep thinker. Last week, she asked me if I’ve ever had my heart broken. And last night, she asked if we could do yoga together. She catches me off guard with her questions at least two times a week. You can just tell by the things she asks that she thinks a lot.  My youngest is attached to my hip. She’s my chef in training. I’ve never seen a child so interested in food the way that she is. It’s a struggle to keep her out of the kitchen. She’s also my little artist.  What would you like to do after this is all over?  I want to be able to travel with my kids. We were supposed to go to Puerto Rico for Mother’s Day. My children have never been there, and I think that’s the first big thing we’re gonna do.   They don’t have any stamps on their passports yet, but we’re gonna get there. I’ve also thought about taking them on a cruise. Mama loves to travel, and they’re my travel buddies.   How do you feel about SaverLife?  Where have you guys been all my life? That’s what first comes to mind. Discovering SaverLife was like finding a needle in the haystack—and I found that needle! SaverLife has been a real blessing to our lives. It’s great that you teach people about the importance of savings. Before I was even approved for the emergency response fund, I saw what you all were doing in communities. It was really motivational.   This pandemic has really taught a lot of people how to save. Sometimes, it’s the difference between having a roof over your head and not having one.  "}
{"prompt":"Karina’s Story: Needs Vs. Wants","completion":" Meet Karina, a PhD student in Chemistry living in Columbus, Ohio with her young son.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  Sometimes we think we need things that we really don’t need. If you just wait, you realize that you really don’t need that thing. As a kid, when I asked my mom for something, she would tell me to wait. Or she’d give me conditions – “I’ll buy it for you if you do X or Y.” And then by the time it was done, I didn’t really want it anymore.  What do you want to do after you graduate?  I want to work in an industrial setting, whether it’s analyzing food or different home products that people might be using at home for their chemical composition or contaminants. I also want to teach and continue to do outreach programs for kids to get involved in science and chemistry.  What have been your highest and lowest financial points?  Let’s start with highest. I got a pay raise and a nice bonus, which went straight into my savings. I was in a fellowship program working with a middle school teacher to design science lesson plans.  The lowest was when I didn’t have a job and had to use my savings. That was maybe six or seven years ago. It was sad to have to use my savings. I’ve been saving since I started working, because you never know. You have to save for the future.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  There’s a lot of things that you have to put together to put yourself in a good financial position. It’s not just one thing. There are so many factors that you have to consider. I learned that over a lot of different life experiences.  You need to be able to know what you need, versus what’s a luxury. You need to have money for the future and you can’t just buy everything now. It’s also good to know about investments and opportunities from your company that you can take advantage of, like a 401k plan. There are so many things that, added together, complete the big picture.  What are your goals for the future?  I would like to be able to put money into a retirement account. That’s one of my big financial goals.  I want my son to be able to enjoy his life, enjoy being a kid, and learn a lot. And when he grows up, I want him to be as financially secure as possible. If he’s in a good financial position, he can do something he likes.   What does money mean to you in your life?  I think money is just a tool to get the things that we want and need. "}

{"prompt":"Tori’s Story: Saving For A Rainy Day","completion":" Meet Tori, an internal communications specialist for a credit union who lives in Seattle, WA.   What’s it like where you live?  I’ve been in Seattle for just over three years and I love the nature and outdoorsy lifestyle that’s available here. Being so close to the mountains and water always inspires me.  I have my own studio apartment, but my lease is up in June, so I’ll have to figure out where I’m going to move to next. I know some of my rainy day fund will go toward my move this summer, so I’m preparing for that.  What’s your profession?  I manage internal communications for a credit union, and I dabble in freelance writing—specifically, music journalism—on the side.  I got into music journalism in college. I’ve always loved instruments and the arts in addition to writing. I realized that I could combine music and writing, so I started doing interviews on my own music blog, Between the Notes.  After graduating college, I started at Amazon full-time and worked for City Arts Magazine as a freelance music writer until City Arts closed due to funding issues. Unfortunately, the magazine had to close near the end of 2018 because of a lack of funding. They really tried to keep on going until they ran into financial issues.   My new job does not pay as much as my previous one, and the rent in my new apartment is higher than what I was paying before, so I had to make major adjustments to my budget to live without barely scraping by.  Did you learn any money lessons growing up?  When I was younger, I would receive loose change every week for my piggy bank or get rewarded monetarily for good grades on my report cards.  My parents actually let me make decisions with the allowance I received in my piggy bank. They helped me understand the difference between a need and a want. I also grew up rolling coins for the bank with my grandpa’s help. He would lecture me about finances, and I used to think it was the most boring thing, but now I see the value in what he had to say about money.  What do you think the value of money is?  My grandpa shared with me the envelope method. He’d divide his budget into physical envelopes: groceries, entertainment, etc. I thought it was inconvenient when I was younger, but as I’ve grown up, I realized that I do that digitally. With the envelope method, you can see where your money goes as well as see the value of saving versus how much you spend.   I’ve learned the value of saving so that when I want to buy something, the money is there.  What do your short-term goals look like now?  I like to set concrete saving goals. When I was unemployed last year and finally moved to be closer to my new job, I had to live off my savings for a while. I definitely had to budget during those times. I’m more disciplined in savings when I have a concrete goal.   I hit the $5,000 goal I made for myself in six months, which is earlier than I thought I would. Originally, I didn’t think I’d reach my goal for a year. Now I’d like to try and save an additional $1,000 in my savings account by June.  How’d you reach an ideal budget?  I stopped going to Safeway and Fred Meyer. It took a while to find the balance between saving money, but still giving myself permission to go out for fun things sometimes. I go to Costco since buying things in bulk can sometimes cost less. I cut down on going to concerts, I bring my lunch to work, and I did a lot of at home entertainment. It took a while to figure out the balance.    What are your long-term savings goals?  I want to go on an international trip and visit Italy, Greece, and England. Also, I know it feels far off, but I want to have money saved for the down payment of my future home. It would be nice to have my student loans paid off and be debt free.  Have you had to make any adjustments to your budget since the shelter-in-place mandates?  I haven’t had to make a lot of changes to my budget actually. The option to have food delivered has been the biggest temptation for extra spending. I’ve become more conscious of my overall spending habits since my grocery expenses have been a bit higher these last couple of weeks. In that sense, I’ve had to put more of my normal budget toward groceries. I guess the money I would’ve spent going out to eat is now going toward my grocery budget.  What would you like to do after things get back to normal?  I’m looking forward to seeing friends again and spending time with them. I miss going out to dinner and seeing concerts with my friends. In fact, I was supposed to see Pearl Jam in San Diego in April, but it was postponed, and the rescheduled date hasn’t been announced yet.  How has SaverLife helped you dedicate money towards your emergency account?  SaverLife has helped me intentionally start saving. Instead of telling myself that I’d save and not follow through, SaverLife helped me dedicate time and effort toward saving. Since joining, I was able to save $1,000 in my emergency funds account. From only having $50 left in my savings in September 2019 to having $1,000 by January 2020, I was proud of how far I’ve come.  What does “living within your means” mean to you?  It means being in a place where I can pay all the bills and not worry where the money comes from each month. I still want to be able to have fun money for entertainment and clothes in addition to building my emergency savings. I’m in a good spot right now financially, so I don’t have to worry as much about paying the bills.   When I first moved to Seattle, it felt like half of my money went to paying rent. It’s not sustainable long term. When I got a promotion at my previous job, I was living a bit more comfortably, but I had to take a pay cut when I got the new job and I was paying more in rent at my new place. Basically, I was having to work with more expenses and less income.  What are you primarily using SaverLife for?  I am using SaverLife to help me rebuild my emergency fund. In 2019, I was unexpectedly unemployed for three months, and I had to use most of my savings to pay rent, bills, and other expenses while I looked for a new job. A month into my new job, I moved to another apartment, which depleted the rest of my savings.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  Using SaverLife has helped me set a budget to fit my new income and expenses so I can live within my means.   I am grateful for a program like SaverLife to help keep me focused on my savings goal! I still have a way to go before I reach my end goal, but several months ago, even saving $1,000 felt impossible.   The program has been really beneficial. It’s made me think about saving money and what I put into my savings. Having the weekly incentive from Scratch & Save has been great. It’s helped me turn my thoughts about saving money into a reality. It’s a good reminder to transfer the money and not just say I’m going to do it.  "}
{"prompt":"Amy’s Story: An Essential Employee During the Coronavirus Pandemic","completion":" Meet Amy, a banker with two teenage daughters who lives in North Tazewell, Virginia.  What’s your profession?  I work at New People’s Bank and I do customer service. I do loans and I dabble in just about everything in the bank.  We have a stay-at-home order except for essential employees or groceries because of coronavirus. It’s in place until June 10. Our bank lobbies are closed but the drive-throughs are open. I still get to work, thank goodness.  Sometimes you’d think, “I’d like to stay at home.” But really, I feel blessed that I still have a paycheck right now.  What do you like about the community in North Tazewell?  It’s a small community, a small town. I’ve lived here my whole life. I just like the pace. It’s slow. I’ve visited big cities before, and I can’t imagine the hustle and bustle. It’s a safe community and I feel safe here and comfortable. It’s great to visit cities because there’s so much to do, but the feeling when you come home is just a breath of fresh air.  How did you find out about SaverLife?  The bank I work at was a partner with SaverLife for the SaverLife Bluefield campaign. On a webinar, the SaverLife representative told us we could sign up ourselves so we could tell customers about it.  What’s your living situation like?  I am married, but my husband and I don’t live together. My youngest daughter lives with me, and my husband and my oldest daughter have moved out. It’s been hard. We’re still married and there’s no divorce on the horizon. It’s more of a partnership now. I have a 15-year-old and a 13-year-old. They live pretty near us. We can actually walk to their house! I see my older daughter every day, but she’s a daddy’s girl and she wants to be with him.  What does a day in your life currently look like?  I get up, I get ready for work, and I go to work. I don’t go out to lunch anymore because I just bring it with me to work. When I get home, I fix dinner and go over my daughters’ homework with them.  My parents are in their mid-70s and they live 15 minutes away from me. I’m afraid to visit them because I am still dealing with the public. I wash my hands all day and take all kinds of precautions, but it’s still scary. My mom made Easter lunch for us, which she does every year, but I didn’t feel safe going over.  How is your family coping with what’s going on?  My daughters aren’t affected so much. My older daughter is upset that they’ve been out of school for three or four weeks. They miss their friends.  My daughters’ teachers send work to them while school is closed. It’s hard to get them to do all that work. I’m working during the day, so I can’t really monitor what they’re doing.   What do you envision for your family’s future?  In the immediate future, I would like this virus to be done! Longer-term, I’d ultimately like my kids to go to college and have a good future, where they can depend on themselves and don’t have to depend on anyone to take care of them.  My older daughter has dropped the bomb that she wants to be a diesel mechanic because that’s what her dad does. He’s a heavy equipment mechanic in a coal mine, and she really loves him and idolizes him. She wants to go to vocational school. That’s a hard career, especially for a woman! You want to tell your kids that they can do whatever they want to do, but you also have your own preferences.  She’s loved animals her whole life. In middle school, she wanted to be a vet. But now all of a sudden, she wants to be a diesel mechanic. My youngest daughter, who’s in seventh grade, told her pediatrician she wants to be a cheerleader for the 49ers.  What has the financial impact of the coronavirus crisis been for you?  It hasn’t impacted me financially, thank goodness. My husband is still working as well. We live on the Virginia side of the Virginia/West Virginia state line and the governor of West Virginia has made coal mining an essential job.  However, I don’t see nearly as much traffic and I know that a lot of Main Street businesses, mom and pop businesses, that have had to close. That’s heart-breaking.  But it’s also a bit worrisome that I’m not sure everyone is obeying the stay-at-home order. I understand that people need to get outside, but I wish everyone would do what they need to so that this can end faster.  What does money mean to you in your life?  I like money and I know it’s important, but it’s not the main thing I focus on. I don’t obsess about it.  Are you a good saver?  Yes and no. I’m a good saver, but if I have a lot saved, I’ll dip into it for this or that. I often wonder how to balance my savings with my debt, and I use my savings to pay off my debt.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I recently won a $50 gift card to Amazon! I think it’s a good motivational tool to help people save. Once you have a goal, it’s easier to visualize what you’re saving for. It gives you a motivation to save more. "}
{"prompt":"Jason’s Story: Big Dreams of Giving Back to the Community","completion":" Meet Jason, a student who’s pursuing an A.A. in Fine Arts from the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI).  How are your college classes?   We start in-person classes in January, so I’m looking forward to that. All my classes are online right now, which isn’t too bad. It helps that my generation is pretty good at using technology, but the learning experience is completely different compared to what we would’ve had in person.  You seem very busy with school. Are you also working?  I’m not working right now. I have Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). The one downside is that I can’t save more than $2,000 in a savings account. I want to get to a point where I can comfortably pay my rent and internet a month before they’re due. I still have medication to pay for, an emergency fund to build, and I just bought a printer but need ink. It’s tough that I’m limited in how much money I can actually save.  Walk me through a day in your life.  In the morning, I usually get the art supplies I need for the day and prepare for my drawing classes. When my morning classes are done, I take my dad out for lunch. He’s done so much for me growing up. At the end of the day, all we have is family. He’s also my only source of transportation. The local transportation program here in Providence is pretty limited. It either comes either too early or too late. At night, I create essential oil mixes for friends.   Recently, I was able to see some goats, which was nice. I used to have a job walking goats around a botanical garden, so it was nice to see them again.  It seems like you and your dad have a great relationship. Can you tell me more about that?  My family disowned me for being transgender and my dad is the only family I have now. When I was growing up, I didn’t know about saving too much. My parents took me to Disneyland in the 90s and maxed out their credit cards in the process. They made me peanut butter sandwiches to take to school when I was younger, but I would throw them away at lunch because I didn’t want my friends to know I was poor. Now I’m a little sad thinking about those times I did that.   I think I’m the one setting the example for my dad now. Before we started talking about money, he would go to casinos and play lottery tickets. Now I teach him things like how to earn free coffee from Dunkin Donuts. I’m becoming more resourceful as I get older and I’m happy to share that knowledge with my dad.  I’m learning from their mistakes as well as the ones I made in the past. When I got money for Christmas growing up, I was quick to spend it. My advice to people would be: “Save your birthday and Christmas money.”   In our  November to Remember  initiative, you shared the small business Colorful Cute Goods. How did you discover that business and can you tell me more about it?   I’m all about supporting small businesses. Actually, I was able to interview the owner of  Colorful Cute Goods  to talk about how they got started. In February of 2017, Madeline Bustamonte launched the brand. It was a big jump for her and she said it took a while for her to really believe she could be a small business owner.  Her inspiration came from customer requests. She’s always looking for unique and different items that are still affordable for her customers. When I asked her if she had any advice for those interested in starting a business, she said, “Grow into it, don’t go into it.” Some people like to jump into all the bells and whistles, but you’ll end up paying more than you bargained for if you’re not ready. She tries to keep herself accountable because at the end of the day, she’s her own boss.  I was inspired by Madeline’s determination! She started out selling her items at booths and craft fairs and she’s grown from there. She now has almost  10,000 followers on her Instagram . I really admire that she took a chance on her dreams!  What are you looking forward to doing after college?  One of my far-fetched goals is that I want to do composite pictures of missing people. I want to improve my skills and be able to draw people as they looked like when they were young and then draw them as they’d look now. I took criminology and ceramics courses in addition to art and I want a way to combine what I learned.   I’ve also thought of becoming an elementary school art teacher. Growing up, my art teachers always made me feel special and I want to be able to do that for other kids. I want to give back to my community the way they gave back to me.  Do you have student loans?   My college tuition is covered by FAFSA. I also received two awards from my college, the Book Award and the Presidential Award, which have helped me cover any other education expenses I have.  What do the holidays look like for you this year?  I don’t have any plans whatsoever. It sucks. The pandemic put a wrench in a lot of our plans. For Thanksgiving, my dad and I are just going to IHOP. We’re not going out as much now and our county may go back to having phase one restrictions. As of last Sunday, we have a statewide 10pm curfew here in Rhode Island. You can’t leave your house unless you’re going to grab essentials.   What would you like to do when things get better and the world opens up?  I can’t wait to have doctors come to me and take me where I need to go. One of the biggest struggles I have is that I can’t read facial expressions well. I can’t wait until things are normal and I can see people’s faces. Before the pandemic, I was learning how to cook. I definitely want to learn more life skills in general. I started making my own grilled cheese sandwiches and last week I even made my own chocolate! My dad is the taste tester for everything I make.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  Oh my gosh, I’m on there every day. I especially like checking out the  forum  and responding to members. I won  Scratch & Save  twice, which was nice. I also received one of the  Emergency Response Fund  grants. I had never held $500 in my hand before. The feeling you get from someone helping you, it inspires a chain reaction. I love the way that you all project yourself on the internet. The amount of people I see getting help on social media is awesome.     "}
{"prompt":"Nade’s Story: A Bronx Business Owner","completion":" This Bronx business owner was expecting a new member to the family, but never thought she’d be facing a pandemic.   Welcoming a new baby in the time of coronavirus is scary enough. But for pregnant mother Nade, who is expecting her third child next month, concern for her health and her baby’s is compounded by the sudden financial freefall that is threatening her family. Nade, who lives with her husband and her two children (3 and 24) in the Bronx, runs her own cleaning business with two employees. When the coronavirus crisis hit, Nade’s income disappeared overnight. No longer able to pay her employees, she soon found she couldn’t even cover her own expenses.   “With the crisis, the offices we usually clean are all closed. They owe me money, but no one is paying me….I am almost due, and I don’t have money to get the things I need for my baby.”   Nade’s husband, a taxi driver, is also unable to work during the crisis. Nade is terrified she will have to give birth alone, since her OB/GYN told her that her husband would only be able to join her in the delivery room if he shows no signs of illness; the family is doing their best to stay healthy while living in the heart of the pandemic. With so much to worry about, Nade and her husband’s complete and unforeseen loss of income is an untenable burden.   However, in spite of the intense pressure they are under, the couple is striving to stay positive, for the sake of the family. “We are really trying to create a good environment for all of us. When everyone is home, you wake up together, you go to sleep together, you’re always together. So we are trying to not make it stressful for everyone,” she said.  In addition to trying to care for her own family, Nade is concerned about her employees. She is trying to enroll in the paycheck protection plan in order to get financial relief. “It wouldn’t even be for me, I would just use it to pay them. I really hope it works out… I have been so busy with working on the application,” she said.   Nade is optimistic that once the crisis blows over, she will be able to return to cleaning and ensure a strong future for her family, including the new addition. “My hope is that my clients will pay their outstanding bills, and once this is over I can get more clients and contracts, and keep growing the business,” she said.  Until she can get back to work, Nade is stretching her dollars to provide for her family. SaverLife partnered with Neighborhood Trust to disburse a $1,000  Emergency Response Fund  payment from Humanity Forward to Nade and many other Bronx residents. The money was enough to pay rent for the month, with a little left over for essentials. “All of us who received the payment, it made a really positive impact on our lives. Whether you use it for rent, electricity, or groceries–it just takes the weight off our shoulders a little bit,” she said.  "}
{"prompt":"Congratulations to our #StashThatCash Contest Winners","completion":" We asked our SaverLife members how they like to #StashThatCash and build their emergency savings fund. Whether it was by couponing, growing a garden, or filling up a coin jar, we loved reading all your savvy ways to save!  Here are the winners and their explanations for how they like to #StashThatCash.  Third Place: Maria D. from Georgia 🥉   So, I… 1. Wrote everything I spent money on for a month. 2. Evaluated and eliminated unnecessary expenses…ex. Cable (did not watch anyway), music app, excess groceries that used to go bad, etc. 3. Created a very detailed budget that included Savings as a necessary expense. 4. Put the money away and forgot about it. Once I started following my budget it really made it really easy to put the money away and not find myself needing it. So, for me, a budget is KEY to savings.  Second Place: Meg T. from Texas 🥈   Setting financial goals and using a budget tracking app then adjusting it yearly is crucial. An IRA is where future cash goes. Money goals are great but what about having fun? I use coupons and cash back apps to save money on everything from food, clothing, needed appliances and gifts. I’ve had a piggy bank for years where all loose change goes because let’s face it! We have to make some wiggle room to dive into fun and this is how I #stashthatcash!  First Place: Ashley M. from Illinois 🥇   I #StashThatCash by keeping it digital! Loose cash and coins get spent quickly. So I deposit my cash quickly and only charge (to my credit card) what I know I can repay when bills are due. I use the Digit app to automatically save little amounts daily for a rainy day fund. I’ve saved over 2K and it’s definitely come in handy! I also use CashApp to accept babysitting payments. I always cash out “standard” so I get ALL of my money and never have to pay a fee. #StashThatCash all day every day!   "}

{"prompt":"Want to Save Money on Your Monthly Internet Bill?","completion":"    Could you use a HUGE discount on your monthly internet bill? Do you need new equipment (laptop, desktop computer, or tablet) for yourself or a family member? You might be able to take advantage of the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) program.  You could receive up to  $50/month or $75/month discount  on your monthly internet bill  You could get a  one-time discount of up to $100 for a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet Tens of millions of Americans are still eligible  for the EBB program who have not yet applied  Who is eligible?   Have you experienced  any  of the following?   Experienced a substantial loss of income since February 29, 2020 and had a total income in 2020 at or below $99,000 for single filers and $198,000 for joint filers Have received SNAP/FreshEBT benefits Have been approved to receive benefits under the free and reduced-price school lunch program or the school breakfast program, including through the  USDA Community Eligibility Provision , in the 2019-2020, 2020-2021, or 2021-2022 school year Have received low-income housing (Section 8) assistance Received a federal Pell Grant in the current award year If you qualify (or already receive benefits from) the  Lifeline program Have an income at or below 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines If you meet the eligibility criteria for a participating broadband internet service provider’s existing low-income or COVID-19 program  How to Apply  There are three ways to apply:  1.  By visiting  GetEmergencyBroadband.org  You DO NOT have to provide your Social Security Number (SSN) during the application process.   2.  Through a participating internet service provider’s website  Use this tool  to find a participating broadband provider. Participating companies can help you with the application process.  3.  By mail  Call (833) 511-0311 for a mail-in application or print an application (available in  English  and  Spanish ) and mail it to:   Emergency Broadband Support Center  P.O. Box 7081  London, KY 40742  Note : If you’re applying through the FCC or by mail, there are two steps: 1) Application process 2) Finding a provider  If you’re applying directly through your provider, there is no 2-step process.  Here are the top five participating internet service providers   AT&T : Offering fixed and wireless internet service Comcast : Offering fixed internet services Cox : Offering fixed internet service and devices T-Mobile : Offering fixed and wireless internet service along with devices Verizon : Offering fixed and mobile internet service  Here’s the difference between  fixed and wireless internet  Frequently Asked Questions  “ Will I receive a check every month to use toward my internet expenses? ”  The funding for the EBB goes directly to internet providers. These providers will take $50 to $75 of peoples’ monthly internet bills if they qualify and apply for the EBB program. This means: you will not directly receive a check to pay for your internet bill. The discount will appear on your internet bill. If your monthly bill is lower than your discount, you WILL NOT receive money back. At that point, your internet bill will be $0.  “ Do I still qualify  if I split my internet bill with another family in my house ? ”  It’s important to note that there can only be one benefit  per household . Use  this household worksheet  to determine your household’s eligibility for the EBB program. A household is a group of people who live together who share money— even if they’re not related . If you either don’t live together or you don’t share money, you are two or more households.  “ I live in an apartment building. Do I qualify? ”  Households with multi-unit dwellings (apartments, nursing homes, group homes) may be able to apply.  A household can qualify because of eligible dependent children that meet the eligibility criteria (see “Who is eligible?” bullet points above).  “ When will the EBB Program end? ”  The EBB is a temporary program developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program will end once the program funds are exhausted, or six months after the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) declares an end to the pandemic—whichever comes first.  Participating internet providers must give households notice about the last date or billing cycle that the full benefit will apply to their bill (not date specific). Households will need to opt-in or request to continue broadband services with that same provider. If households don’t opt-in, the internet provider will automatically opt them out.   Reminder : If you’re already in the  Lifeline program , you do not have to provide documentation to sign up for EBB. Upon signing up for EBB through the national verifier, a provider will see that the eligible participant qualifies.  Families across the country use broadband to work, learn, talk with their doctors, and manage their money. SaverLife families have had to pay more for and upgrade their broadband during the pandemic. Here at SaverLife, we know that the EBB is a vital program, and it’s critical that more families know that help is available. "}

{"prompt":"Madeline & Kristi’s Story: Working Together is the Dream","completion":" Meet Madeline ( M ) and Kristi ( K ), two best friends who both live and work in Mississippi.   What’s your profession?  K : I’ve been a hairstylist for 20 years now. I absolutely love my job and talking with my customers. We laugh together, connect, and I enjoy getting to interact with so many different personalities.  M : I’ve had several jobs over the years, but my profession has mainly been customer service. Just like Kristi, I like talking to people. I found out that you can have that personal connection with people in the nail tech field, so I’m excited to pursue that.  How did you two meet?  M : We met in high school. At the time, we were both playing basketball and found out we lived just a few houses away from each other.  K : We attended college together as well! We both went to Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College.  What’s your household like?  M : I’m a single parent of three children and we live at our home.  K : I’m also a single parent, but I live with my mom and dad. One of my kids is in college and the other is a senior in high school.   Walk me through a day in your life.  K : On a regular day when I’m working, I start my day at 6am. I wake up, get dressed, and I arrive at work around 6 of 7am. Since my son’s doing his school work online, I try to help him with whatever he needs. My parents have also been there to help me whenever I need them. After I’m done with work, I come home, cook, and make sure everybody eats dinner.  M : I’m an early riser, too. I wake up at 5:30am, get the kids ready for school, make sure they get on the bus, prepare dinner for that night, then clean up around the house. My 20-year-old and I take nail technician classes together, so on the days we have classes, my father helps me with my kids from 3pm-9pm. He helps them with their homework and makes sure they eat.  What does school look like for your kids this year?  K : My daughter came home last year for spring break, and she’s been going to school online ever since. She attends Ole Miss, but thankfully she only has one in-person class this semester. As for my son, he’s also taking his high school classes online.  M : My youngest kids are going to school in-person. They like it so far, and they were definitely ready to go back. I wanted them to do distance learning, but I waited too long to register them.  Madeline, you said Kristi inspired you to pursue your dream of becoming a nail technician. Could you tell me more about that?  M : That day was a real blessing. I just got my nails done that day, and the lady who did them was telling me about the nail technician courses she took. That’s when I first started thinking about getting certified as a nail tech. Kristi had called me later that day because she said I was on her mind. She told me that I should go for my dream!  K :  I always try to call Madeline and uplift her. I like to remind her that she doesn’t have to settle for less than she deserves. Often, I’ll say, “You may be going through a storm now, but you’ll come out soon. You have purpose. You’ve got a destiny.” I’ve known her for a long time. She has such a big heart, and I pray for her.   Tell me about a favorite memory you two share.  M : There are just too many to count! In high school, Kristi played a trick on me and pushed me down the street in a shopping cart. We just kept laughing!  K : Also in high school, we were at Madeline’s grandmother’s house when we decided to phone a psychic. It was one of those 1-800 pay per minute gigs where the first minute is free, but the psychic always tries to stretch out their words. When Madeline’s mom got the phone bill the next month, she said to us, “The next time you want to talk to a psychic, I’ll be your psychic!”   Are either of you currently saving for anything in particular?  M : I’m saving and trying to increase my credit score. Eventually, I want to become a homeowner.   K : I’m saving, too. Each year, I try to put money in a new CD because I’m trying to help my kids build generational wealth. I’m also saving to start my own business.  Tell me more about the business you’d like to open.  K : I’ve been the co-owner of the barber shop/hair salon where I work for the past 13 years, but I want to have my own business one day. It’s been great so far! I just want a space where I can be creative and see my ideas come to life. I already have a name for my business: Slay Hair Oils and More.  As a hairstylist, I’ve seen how issues with hair can really affect a woman’s self-esteem. Last year, the Lord gave me this vision of developing a hair oil that stops your hair from shedding and makes it soft. With His help, I was able to create a product that helps with those issues.  M : Kristi is going to be very successful. She has the personality for it and she’s a great people person!  Do you have any advice for someone who’s just starting to learn about money?  K : Find good investments that work for you. That may be CDs, stocks, or real estate. You have to think in the mindset of “How can I increase what I already have?” Also, don’t spend frivolously. Compare interest rates at banks and watch out for fees. Check out your credit report and see if there’s anything on there that can be disputed. You have to think about your future when you want to save.  M : Pay yourself first. Even if it’s only 10% of your paycheck, pay yourself first. Remember to check your credit score from time to time. Use your phone to your advantage. There are so many great apps that can help you manage your money. They’re not called smart phones for nothing!  How do you feel about SaverLife?  M : I love SaverLife! I was introduced to it through a home ownership program. I’m always looking for ways to save and be better with my money. The member stories are really inspirational. I also enjoy playing Scratch & Save weekly, and I’ve actually won a few times. The Race to $100 is great, too! "}
{"prompt":"Tiffany’s Story: 100% Self-Made, Independent, and Proud of It","completion":" Meet Tiffany, an insurance company Customer Service Expert who lives in Michigan with her six-year-old son.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I was always a hard worker and strived to make my own money. I’ve saved money to buy the things I wanted or felt I deserved. I pride myself on being able to provide my son with many of his wants.  What’s the best purchase you’ve made?  I’m most proud of purchasing my house 14 years ago with no help. There were no co-signers involved in the process. I decided that it would be a smarter investment than renting. I plan to forever have this house as a part of my family. It’ll also be an opportunity to leave it as an inheritance for my son. It means so much to me. It’s not a big house. It’s the perfect size for my son and me. I’ve done a lot of remodeling and redecorating to make it person to me. I set a goal and I work on it.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Don’t depend on anyone else to fund your dreams. I was given that piece of advice when I bought my house. I didn’t factor in financial help from anyone else when I thought about my ability to pay for my home.  What’s one thing you know about money now that you wish you knew when you were younger?  Don’t sign up for those credit cards while you’re in college. Those credit cards are the devil. They get you through your college years, but they’re your worst enemy once you graduate. Once you’re working, all those helpful perks go away. They don’t raise your credit limit anymore or give you any forgiveness. It’s okay to have one credit card for emergencies, but really treat it as such.  I utilize my credit cards now for the benefits. When it’s time to go on vacation, I use the points. I also use them to build my credit.  What are your goals for the future?  I’m trying to save up for my son to go to college. I would love for him to go to my alma mater, Michigan State University. I want to make sure he doesn’t have any financial burdens when he goes to school like I did.  How did you finance college?  I had a full tuition scholarship, but it didn’t include housing, so I had to take out loans for that.  What financial lessons do you want to pass on to your son?  I want to teach him about the importance of having an emergency fund. Always have your own life insurance that’s separate from your work provided policy. Definitely have that piece of financial stability and budgeting.  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money is freedom. It’s the ability to do the things you enjoy and not be dependent on others. "}
{"prompt":"Julie’s Story: Waiting for Unemployment Insurance to Come Through","completion":" Meet Julie, a mother of three children who lives in Lempster, New Hampshire.   Walk me through a day in your life.  I’m not working at the moment, so I’m able to help my three kids with their online school. On a normal weekday, we get up and do our morning routine. We usually do schoolwork in the afternoon because getting them to do school in the morning is tough. Every week is different. The biggest thing that’s affecting me right now is my kids not being in school in-person and full-time. Right now, they’re going to school two days a week, and the other three days they’re here at home with me. And my oldest kid is going to school fully remote, so she doesn’t even go on campus.  When it’s time to relax, we watch tv, eat dinner at the table together, and sometimes they play on their phones.  How are your kids feeling about everything?  They really want to be in school. My son especially wants to be in school because he has an Individualized Education Program (IEP) and his school isn’t doing enough to meet his needs as he does his school work from home.   How did you feel about winning a cash prize from our November Race to $100?  I was happy that I won something! That money went toward our light bill—every little bit helps.  Have you applied to receive unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic?  Yes, I have. After I applied for unemployment insurance, it took four months for my paperwork to be processed. Because of the delay, I’ve been behind on a lot of bills. It’s been a real nightmare.   After my boyfriend and I wrote to the governor’s office, it seemed like our unemployment insurance funds were expedited. We were finally able to pay rent. Unfortunately, since my boyfriend works in multiple states for his job, he had out-of-state wages he had to claim. He didn’t receive as much as he could have when he claimed unemployment because our state’s unemployment online portal is a joke. The online portal kept showing that his out-of-state wages were $0, which just wasn’t true.    What have you been doing to budget?  Budgeting has been a nightmare. My son and I both receive social security insurance and we live off of that. We’re on a fixed income right now, so it’s hard to save. I have to pay rent and bills, and after budgeting for that, I can’t save.   I just got a car because we needed a new one, so now I’m working on including a car payment into our monthly budget, too.   What are you looking forward to doing when things are better?  I just want stuff to go back to normal and the schools to have full-time, in-person classes again. Our town’s local school only has 100 students total and there haven’t been any COVID-19 cases, but they’re being overly cautious. Our school said things are probably never going to go back to normal.  Are you saving for anything in particular?  I’m just trying to get caught up on bills. I feel like I could’ve saved if the world didn’t close and my boyfriend and I weren’t out of our jobs for months. He was a delivery person for restaurants, and when a lot of them closed, they didn’t need him anymore.   How do you feel about SaverLife?  I found it through the Fresh EBT Facebook page. Ever since, I’ve been reading the  Money 101 articles  and  earning Scratch & Save cards  when I can. I wish I had heard about SaverLife before the pandemic. "}
{"prompt":"Bob’s Story: A Father and Business Owner Dedicated to Achieving Financial Freedom","completion":" Bob is an attorney who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico with his wife and three kids. Although he had a successful career and owned a side business with his wife, the family still struggled with budgeting and debt.   Six years ago, Bob got in a car accident that pushed him in a new financial direction.   “I had no savings, no IRA, no pension, and $44,000 in credit card debt,” he said. “I was concerned about my family because I did not have savings.”   Bob took a money management class that changed how he thought about finances.    “I took a focused approach to money,” Bob said. “My goal was to hone in on paying down debt while also building up retirement and investments.”  In 2019, Bob and his wife joined SaverLife after finding out about the program at FinCon. Joining SaverLife helped Bob build his emergency savings.   “It’s always in the background as an accountability thing,” Bob said. “It helps you get more control over your financial health.”   In September 2020, Bob wiped out the last of that $44,000 in credit card debt. He said the competitive aspects of SaverLife, such as the weekly chance to win $5 from  Scratch & Save , help encourage him to save.   Bob was chosen as a finalist for SaverLife’s first Super Saver of the Year in December 2020 and won $1,000. He planned to put some of the money into emergency savings and the rest into sinking funds.   Bob’s newfound financial freedom has allowed him and his wife to turn their nonprofit work teaching kids about robotics into a business.   “Having an emergency fund has made life more enjoyable and less stressful,” Bob said. “Now I’m able to help other folks.” "}
{"prompt":"Siairra’s Story: Raising a Child During the Covid-19 Shutdown","completion":" Meet Siairra, a stay-at-home mother who lives with her 18-month-old son and fiancé in upstate New York.   What’s your profession?  Right now, I’m stay-at-home mom. I was a manager before my son was born, but I left my job soon after I had him. The transition from manager to stay-at-home mom was hard. I moved from Florida when my son was only nine days old.   What’s life like where you live?  We recently moved to Ogdensburg, New York, which is where my fiancé was born. This is his home. It’s so upstate that it’s basically Canada! We’re only two miles from the border and we can see Canada from the river by our house.   We first moved to upstate New York because my fiancé and I had a baby and a pit bull, and we couldn’t find anywhere in Florida where I’m from that accepted that breed of dog. That’s when we decided to move.   It’s been a culture shock living here. This is the only city in the county we live in, and it’s really different from Tampa Bay, which is the kind of city I’m used to. The homes are close, but this city is full of older folks. They’ve got a prison here, a mental institution, and a movie theater that’s been closed for 10 years. Unfortunately, the city hasn’t progressed in 10 years because it drives young people away with high taxes.   In terms of seasons, the fall and summer are great. The library has some fun events for kids, too. Volunteers come to help make crafts and we have social hours.   How are you and your family coping with the coronavirus?  I’m doing better than I originally thought I would. I was more nervous at first, but then again, I get anxiety about things like getting gum off my shoes.  My fiancé is an essential worker and has two jobs. He works during the daytime five days a week at a factory that makes computer boards for hospitals, and two to three days a week he works a night shift at Frito Lay. It makes avoiding exposure very hard. You’re fighting an invisible enemy all day every day. If you don’t work, you may not have a job when things go back to normal.  I always budget four months ahead, so we’re financially prepared. I was proactive about buying essential items before people were buying the stores out, so that puts my mind at ease.  What does your son think about what’s happening?   My wild child of a son is as happy as can be and couldn’t care less about what’s going on. He’s also only 18 months. He’s going through his terrible twos early, I think. Most days, I don’t have time to think about the coronavirus because I’m looking after my very active son.  He’s pretty much on the same schedule as before all this started. He used to go the gas station and run errands with me, but I don’t think he’s noticed that changed. Now, instead of going from establishment to establishment, we just go from room to room a few times a day. We try to keep him busy, which means these days he’s allowed to make way bigger messes than I would usually allow. He has more toys than he knows what to do with.  What does a day in your life currently look like?   My fiancé wakes up and goes to work at the factory early. My son then wakes up around 8am and comes in our room with his blanket, kisses me up on my forehead, and says, “Awww” to me. Usually, he’ll grab the remote and we’ll watch tv, read a book, eat breakfast, play a game, and listen to music. My fiancé gets his lunch break at 12, so we’ll go downstairs to make food and eat with him. Then comes nap time for my son, which lasts about two hours. When he’s done, he’ll stroll out of his room, we’ll read, and have a dance party.  By 3:30 in the afternoon, my fiancé is done with work. He takes a shower first thing when he gets back and then he gives me a little break and watches our son. We make dinner around 5:30pm, then he goes to Frito Lay after dinner if he’s needed. If he goes, I give the baby a bath, put on his jammies, sometimes we finger paint or plays with toys, and then he’s out like a light by 8pm.   My fiancé comes back from his second job around 8pm, then we start our night routine. He takes a shower, we watch YouTube videos, the news, then something funny to lighten the mood, then Joe Rogan videos, and we’re in bed by 10:30 or 11pm.  Instead of going to the grocery store multiple times a week like I used to, I only go once a week—if that. My life is pretty much the same as it always was except for going to the store more infrequently these days.  What’s it like going to Walmart nowadays?  I used to get really bad panic attacks, but I haven’t had them recently. The other day, I saw the signs about social distancing and staying six feet apart and it made me anxious. Inside the store, there were announcements about social distancing, washing hands, and people were wearing masks and dodging one another. I’m only 25 and I haven’t seen anything like this in my lifetime. It’s definitely eerie.  How do you envision your family’s future?  We have a 5-year plan. I do hope that everything gets back to normal soon.   I crave human interaction. Before all this happened, I was looking for something to do after my husband went back to work, but I don’t want to put myself at risk. Hopefully, I can get a job around my fiancé’s schedule. When I get a job, my income will be what we put into our savings.   My fiancé and I were also supposed to get married in July, but now we’re getting married next July in 2021. I have photos of my parents when I was my son’s age at their wedding, and I really want to recreate those photos with our son.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I really like it! Recently I won $5 through Scratch & Save, which was nice. I really love the idea of the different savings challenges. I love all the articles on the website from people because it’s from their different perspectives.  Who doesn’t like free money for doing something you already do?  "}
{"prompt":"Tamiko’s Story: Pay Yourself First","completion":" Meet Tamiko: Tamiko lives in Dothan, Alabama with her two children, Ayonna (13) and Aidan (8). She has worked as an administrative assistant for her church for 16 years.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My mom was a single parent, so she always managed money. It was a struggle for me, but as I got older and had kids, I saw that I needed to save money.  My mother had savings accounts, one in particular called her “emergency cash” to keep at home. She put away money out of each paycheck.  When I was younger, I didn’t think about saving. But as I got older, I had bills and I realized I can’t spend the way I wanted to, as though I was younger. When you have kids, the dependency is on you now.  What are the lowest and highest financial points in your life?  My highest point would probably be now because I have money to do the things I couldn’t do.  My lowest point was during the time I was transitioning away from my kids’ father. All the financial responsibilities fell on me. At some point, I couldn’t see a way to pay for it all.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  My grandmother’s sister used to say, “Pay yourself first.” At first I didn’t understand what she was saying, but then she said, “You know what your bills are every month, but put $20 or $30 aside first. Think of yourself first.”  I try to do that now. If I don’t save the money, I’ll treat myself and the kids to something special.  What are your goals for the future?  I’m working to finish up my bachelor’s degree and get a job in my chosen field, and to be financially stable. I’m getting my degree in health administration. In the past, I’ve worked in hospitals, and I’d love to get back to that in an administration role.  I only have one course and I’ll be done by the end of the year. I’m so excited!  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money means stability, being able to pay and do the things you want to do without asking anybody for it. It’s freedom. "}
{"prompt":"Kimberly’s Story: A Flourishing Business Shut Down by COVID-19","completion":" COVID-19 has forced businesses all over New York–from restaurants to retail–to shut down for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, that includes the stores where Kimberly Hall sources all the inventory for her online clothing business.   “I am an online reseller. Mostly I resell women’s and men’s, and some kids, designer clothing, accessories, and shoes. I source most of my inventory from existing retail establishments, sometimes from Goodwill or Salvation Army or even Macy’s,” she said. All of the usual places Kimberly shops for her inventory have had to close down, leaving her with no way to replenish her stock.   “I remember the day exactly, March 17th. I was shopping for inventory, and the manager of the store asked everyone to come to the front. They announced that this would be the last day open, until further notice. It’s been very difficult as far as replenishing inventory. I have really had to think outside the box,” said Kimberly.   With no inventory to sell, Kimberly receives no income, and can’t pay her expenses. In addition to her lack of stock, Kimberly’s overall sales have plummeted due to the economic recession. “People have lost their jobs, or they’re furloughed, or they’re very nervous about whether they will still have a job. So luxury clothing is not at the top of their priorities,” she said.   Kimberly tried to apply for unemployment, which has been expanded in New York to include small business owners. But she first applied three weeks ago, and is still navigating the process to receive benefits. While waiting for her unemployment, Kimberley received a $1,000 disbursement from Humanity Forward through a  partnership between SaverLife and Neighborhood Trust .     “Anyone who does what I do, we pay selling fees. The more you sell, the higher the fees. So I used some of it to pay my selling fees,” said Kimberly. Kimberly also used some of the payment to pay her cell phone bill; she often uses her cell phone for business as well as keeping in touch with family and friends since she lives alone. The rest, Kimberly put into her savings account.   “I have just reserved the rest since I have yet to receive any other financial help and my business is just a trickle right now. I can’t spend it all at once, even for necessities.”   As a small business owner, Kimberly is used to riding out tight times, but the COVID crisis has been especially challenging. “I am still maintaining my business as best I can. The minute the stores open back up, I will be the first in line,” she said.   We are glad to have been able to give Kimberly some financial security while she waits to get back to work. “I am so thankful for the grant because it really was needed and came just in time,” she said.

{"prompt":"Andrea’s Story: Money is About Having Options","completion":" Meet Andrea, who lives in Connecticut and loves video game memorabilia.  What do you do?  I’m not employed at the moment. I have been employed in the past, but it’s been a while. At the moment, I’m trying to figure out some things before diving back into employment.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My parents definitely made a lot of mistakes, so in some ways I learned what not to do, in terms of saving more than you spend and pay things more on time. It made me look at what you should do better, more than what to proactively do.  I saw a lot that wasn’t a good example. Some of that was them not knowing or not being in a good situation. It’s surprising in retrospect because my mom worked at a bank.  What’s one thing you know about money now that you wish you knew when you were younger?  It really does create options when you have money. It opens doors. When I was younger, I was living more in the moment and not seeing the future, not seeing that you need to set aside a lot of money.  I did save and budget to a certain extent, which has kept me afloat lately. But I had more of a desire to just get what I wanted then.  There were also just some things that I didn’t know – for example, that there are some bank accounts that give you more interest. I didn’t know about that, that my money could be earning more interest over time without me doing anything. I didn’t think about the long-term implications of that.  The other thing that I knew nothing about, even though I had the option, was creating an investment account. I thought, “That’s an extra thing. I don’t need to do it.”  What have been the highest and lowest financial points in your life?  The past couple of years since my divorce have been my lowest. My highest was when I was married. My husband made a decent living and I didn’t have to think about that or worry about it. We worked well with what he had and were able to support ourselves and our child, who’s now an adult.  If I had seen ahead, I would have saved more while married or kept a part-time job. I never saw myself in the position I’m in now.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  It goes beyond “pay yourself first.” Save more than you spend. Don’t spend more than what’s necessary. If you don’t need it, don’t get it. Your priorities should be all about saving.  Any spending that you do, can you get it cheaper? Can you wait? Can you just not get it?  I wish I had had that mindset always, not about instant gratification. I wish I had given purchases more thought.  Now I look at some items I have, and I think, “that could have been money in the bank compounding interest.”  Are there any purchases you’ve made that you still think are good even with that mindset?  Yes and no – it’s conflicting. There are some things that I still have and enjoy, so I am getting pleasure out of them.  For me specifically, this might be a silly or unexpected answer, but I have been a collector of video game memorabilia. That was where a lot of my money has gone – not shoes or clothes that you might think a lot of women want.  On one hand, I maybe shouldn’t have made those purchases, but they do make me happy. And I’ve been able to make money back when I sold some of them. It was fun to meet other collectors when I was selling and connect with other people who have similar interests.  I guess my advice would be not to give up your interests or cut it out of your life, but be thoughtful about what you actually want.  At my age, I’m still really interested, but I need to really cut back. I feel okay about cutting back. Less can be more.  What are your goals for the future?  I’m trying to figure out how to be on my own because this is new. I went straight from my parents to being married. I’m trying to figure out how to be alone at this age with my adult child living away from me.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It means options or lack of them. "}
{"prompt":"Katoya’s Story: COVID-19 Made her Family Have to Live Separately","completion":" Meet Katoya, the supervisor for a post office who lives with her husband and four kids in Hosston, LA.  Tell me what goes on in a day in your life.  Work, home, and kids. That’s basically it. We’ll go on an adventure as a family every now and then.  How has your family been dealing with sheltering in place?  We actually had to split up. With my work schedule and how busy I’ve been at the post office, it’s not like I can leave my kids at home. I work six days a week, sometimes 10 hours each day. I’ve been busier with work since March, and my hours have definitely increased. They’ve probably doubled at this point. Before COVID, I was working part-time, and now I’m working full-time.  And my husband is a truck driver who works weekdays Monday through Friday. It’s nice when he’s home on the weekends because he can help with picking up the kids and whatnot.  My kids and I have a routine down at this point. I’m out of work by 4:35pm, I pick up the boys from their babysitter, then I get ready to be up by 5am the next morning.  My girls are 11 and 13 years old, so they’re too old for daycare. They’ve been staying with my parents since school let out in March, and my other kids are with a babysitter while I’m at work.  What does going back to school look like for you and your kids this fall?  My kids  have  to go back to school. They need the interaction. My 4-year-old is a little behind because he’s going from just having a babysitter teach him to attending pre-K.  Are you saving right now?  Short-term, I start saving for my family’s Christmas presents right about now. I have direct deposit set up so each time I get my check, a certain amount is automatically routed to a separate savings account. I’ve had that savings account since I was 16 years old. I don’t see the money, so I don’t miss it.   I’m not necessarily saving for anything long-term, but I am managing my money better so I can fix my credit. I want to buy myself a nice car in the next two years. In order to do that, I have to fix my credit. Right now, I’m just learning to save money and get my bills paid off.  What are you looking forward to doing when things are safer?  I really would like to take a family day. I used to rotate Saturdays just so we could do a family activity and eat out every other weekend, but now I work Saturdays. We used to go to the movies, skate, go to the park—all kinds of stuff.   Tell me about your greatest financial accomplishment.  I was able to purchase a car using cash, and just a few years ago I bought a house.  When I was saving to buy a car, I just put away money until I reached the max amount of what I was willing to spend on a car. The process wasn’t hard; it was more tempting not to touch the money.  My house buying process was a bit different compared to what most people go through. I first bought property back in 2015 when I was 28 years old. Then I was living in an apartment with my four kids for a while. When I turned 30, I bought us a mobile home.   Do you budget these days?  It’s easier right now because I’m making more money, so I’m able to expand my budget a little. I have money for other things. I don’t really budget, but I just make sure my bills are paid, then I’ll usually have $200 to $300 left over to spend. We’re not living paycheck to paycheck, so we’ve got a bit more breathing room. However, my husband and I have to budget his overhead from his truck business. The trucking business is expensive.  I no longer have to say to myself, “I have to work X hours to make $XXX to pay my bills.”  Could you tell me more about what it was like living paycheck to paycheck?   It was a struggle.  When my husband bought his truck, we were living off of my paycheck. We had just moved into our mobile home with the kids. It takes a lot to get a truck on the road as an operator. We learned that running a business is not always about profit. It’s about breaking even and keeping your head above water. He has to have food, tires, diesel—the list goes on. At first, it was a struggle to find the right company that he could make a profit working for. All in all, a truck’s overhead costs are about $10,000 a year. It’s a lot more than what people think.  How’s it been with you and your husband both working?  I’m making more money, and he can pick when he wants to work. We’re actually able to save for rainy days and times when my husband might be down for a week because his truck is in the auto shop.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather additional costs during the pandemic?  We haven’t had to dip into our savings because we’re constantly working and earning more money than we were used to. We’ve been able to actually put more money in our savings account.  I noticed we don’t spend as much on eating out or buying frivolous things. My girls are staying with their grandparents, so there go my shopping buddies. I just really go to work, pick up my younger kids, then shop at the grocery store. Shopping for groceries online has helped me budget. Instead of going to the store and walking around the aisles, you can just have someone shop for what you need.  How are your girls doing since they’re not at home?  My girls help their grandma with her t-shirt business. Since they’re earning money now, they want to spend it. They tell me they’re going out to McDonald’s or buying hair for $50, so I had to talk to them about saving money.  It’s a learning trait; it’s something that’s taught. My mom taught me how to spend, but now I’m teaching my daughters how to save. I don’t want them to live paycheck to paycheck when they’re older. My husband is a saver, but he’s not around them as much as I am, so they pick up on my habits.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I really like it! I even introduced my girls and my mom to the  helpful articles  on the website. "}
{"prompt":"Everything You Need to Know About Voting by Mail","completion":" When you think about voting, you may think about standing in line at your neighborhood polling place with your friends and neighbors, waiting your turn to cast a vote you feel proud of — one that will result in laws and policies that support your finances and your values.  But that’s not the only way to vote. And for many people, it’s certainly not the most convenient or safe way to vote.      Absentee voting, or voting by mail, has become much more mainstream lately. And whether you vote in person or by mail, it’s still public record that you took the time to cast a vote and participate in democracy.  But like everything else voting-related, the rules for absentee voting vary state by state.   Here are four things you need to know about absentee voting:  1. Your state’s absentee ballot rules  Some states allow anyone to vote absentee and do not require a reason. Other states require specific reasons for requesting an absentee ballot — for instance, that you will be absent from the county on election day or are required to work a shift of 10 hours or more that conflicts with polling hours.   However, in light of COVID-19, many of the states that are typically strict about absentee voting are allowing absentee ballots to anyone who requests one. And some states are automatically mailing absentee ballots to every single registered voter.   Check my state’s absentee ballot rules  If you’re in a state where you’ll automatically get a ballot in the mail, make sure your mailing address is correct on your voter registration.   Check my voter registration status  2. How to request an absentee ballot  Before you request a ballot, check your state’s absentee ballot application deadline.  Check my state’s absentee ballot application deadline  Vote.org has a wonderful online resource for requesting an absentee ballot in any state.  Request an absentee ballot  Alternatively, you can also  contact your local election office  for an application, which you can mail, fax, or email back.  3. Your state’s completed absentee ballot deadlines  To count in the election, completed absentee ballots must be received by your state’s deadline. Some states count when the ballot is postmarked, and others count when it is received.  For instance, in Texas, your voted absentee ballot must be postmarked one day before Election Day and received by the day after Election Day. In California it must be postmarked by Election Day and received no later than 17 days after. And in Florida, it doesn’t matter when you send it, but your ballot must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day.  Check my state’s absentee ballot deadlines  4. How to return your absentee ballot  Most people return their voted absentee ballot by mail. But you can also hand-deliver your ballot to a designated location or drop box.  Contact your local election office  to find out where you can return your absentee ballot.      Next step: figure out your voting plan! People with an explicit plan for how they’ll get to the polling place, and at what time, are typically much more successful in voting.

I work in social services full-time and I work with individuals who are seeking reemployment. I believe that support has the power to change lives.  What’s your relationship with money?  I’ll be honest with you, I’ve made mistakes with money in the past. I’ve overspent to make myself feel better on the inside. I’d like to think that “comparison is the financial monster that lives in the bank.”   I used to ignore past due debts, not monitor my credit reports, and not look at my bank statements. But when I got older, I made a commitment to be better. My credit score went up by 30 points after I looked at my credit report and found a mistake from five years ago. It really pays to look into those things!  Tell me about how your mom influenced you.  Growing up, I had no clue all the sacrifices she made. She stopped college to take care of me while also working full-time. That was a big sacrifice for sure. At five or six years old, I probably didn’t think about that. She never left our needs to anyone else.  When she was working at Woolworths, she had this vision for herself to work at a bank. At that time, she only had partial college credits, but she wanted to see how far she could go. She eventually applied for a job in the accounting department and got it.  My mom would do simple things that made a big difference. For example, I didn’t realize that we were eating ramen every night because she made the dish look fancy. She’d put the noodle soup in glass bowls and add garnishes like an egg on top. When I got older and went grocery shopping with my mom, I saw how diligent she was with making sure to keep within her budget. She would shop at Aldi’s and I noticed that she would never casually spend her money—she always had a plan.   Even when she became a project manager at a financial investment firm, she still stuck to her budgeting habits. If she got a bonus, she’d put that money in her savings. If she got a raise, she’d keep her spending the same.    “ My mom made the best of whatever we had and made it look as if it were fit for a king and queen. It was only later as a teenager did I realize that I didn’t see her eat often when I was young or only after serving me, and that some of my favorite dishes were made of noodles or eggs and other low cost staples. But she always smiled and She. Always. Found. Money. To. Save.  I grew to respect her hard work and sacrifice so much that I would often ask to thrift for new clothes and skipped asking for senior pictures and trips. I remember being excited to find a dress for senior prom for $20 because it wouldn’t stretch my mom too much. My mom was 19 when I came along, but I am proud to say 40 years later she is a leader in her field of Finance and Technology. She has a bigger budget to work from, but she has the same smile and spirit from when I was five years old eating my mom’s special noodles. ❤️ ”   What did the 2020 holidays look like for you?  I’m a big believer that there is so much value in giving whatever you have—it does not have to be monetary. Everyone appreciates when you give them time and attention. I tried to do cash-only Christmas and not give into “guilt gifting.” Homemade cards go a long way!   How do you feel about SaverLife?  I really like how SaverLife was able to put me in touch with a financial coach! They give me relevant resources to look to for guidance. My financial coach is great. Recently, I was telling her what I’ve been going through and she said, “Don’t be hard on yourself. Introduce a new perspective to your situation.”  Just last week, I was thinking about opening a  529 account  for my 5-year-old daughter, and SaverLife had an article on just that in the  Ask An Expert  section! I love that everything on the website is free.  "}

{"prompt":"Brett’s Story: The Price of Debt","completion":" Meet Brett, a full-time student living in Indiana, Pennsylvania who’s pursuing his PhD degree.   What do you do?  I’m in the second year of my program at Indiana University, pursuing a degree in Literature and Criticism. It’s the study of literature but using theories and criticism to discuss different pieces.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  As a child up through graduating college, I was really not taught much about saving money. My parents were probably bad roles models in that sense. They used credit cards to pay for everything and would only make monthly payments. Goodness knows how much they paid in interest in their lives.  When I got older, it was extremely easy to get credit in the late 80s. Every student in college I knew had three or four credit cards. Every week, there would be someone on the street corner who asked, “Hey want a credit card? You’ll get a free t-shirt!”  Most people I knew had 25% APRs. If you were smart, you paid it off. If you weren’t smart, you made poor decisions. I understood the concept on paying interest and not wanting things to end up costing more than what I paid for them.  What are your lowest and highest financial points?  Probably a few years ago I experienced my lowest point. I had recently left a position in 2016 where my job paid for my food and housing in addition to a nice salary. I had to find a place to live. I did okay for the first couple of months because of severance pay. Once that ended, I was just living off my savings. I went from having a nice savings nest to having nothing.  My financial high point would’ve been the beginning of 2016 when I still had my position. I was doing very well and saving lots of money. I was able to put money in my Roth IRA and SRAs; I felt like I had multiple lines of savings.   Have you found it possible to save since losing that position?  I’m just increasing my debt each semester with my loan check that helps pays for bills. I put that money in my savings, and it pays through the semester. The hope is once I graduate and get a real job, that I could save from there.  I don’t know how one can save when they’re a student. The reality for most is, “How can I save when I should be paying off debt?” Where I am, savings accounts are paying less than what my debt costs.   How did you know where to start saving?  I worked in higher education and it’s a good line of work that offers workshops to help you gain knowledge. Most of my money is saved through TIAA. They were good about offering workshops and one-on-one counseling.   What’s one thing you know about money now that you wish you could tell your 18-year old self?  I knew a girl in college. She and I took a few classes together. I admired her greatly because as she went to school, she was working throughout. She was a dedicated housekeeper who would never go out to eat.  I just can’t imagine living my life so restrictively as I went through college. For me, I’d rather have debt in college and have life experiences than not live. I was able to travel to multiple countries in Europe and Russia. I can’t say that I regret the choices I made when I was in college.  You could end up being 40 with no debt because you sacrificed as a young person, but I don’t know if you’ll be any better off from a life satisfaction standpoint.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It means opportunity. Going somewhere, buying something—it all involves money.   What are your savings goals?  Soon I’ll be applying for a teaching assistantship. If I get it, I’ll be teaching two classes each semester. I’ll be paid $25,000 a year, so I’ll be above the poverty line. If I get the position, I’ll have access to the university’s health insurance, and I won’t have to take out any more loans. Getting this assistantship would open up a lot of opportunities for me and help me build my savings. "}
{"prompt":"Emmanuel’s Story: A North Carolina Dad Invests in His Family’s Future","completion":" Meet Emmanuel, an Applications Analyst at a hospital. He used stimulus payments and savings to pay off debt during the pandemic.  Earlier in life, Emmanuel wasn’t “the best with money.” He didn’t learn about money management when he was growing up and accrued significant credit card debt in his twenties.    The pandemic has been a scary time for many, but in the midst of stay-at-home orders, Emmanuel was able to find a bright spot: saving money.   “I no longer had to drive to work every day, and we cut out unnecessary weekend spending,” he said.   When he turned 30, Emmanuel got serious about personal finance. He lives with his fiance and their children, and he’s committed to teaching their children about money.   “I make it a point to talk to our kids about the power of saving so they won’t learn later on in life like I did,” Emmanuel said.   During the pandemic, Emmanuel and his fiance bought a rental property to create another income stream. Emmanuel put every cent he could toward paying off credit card debt.   “I carried balances like people carry purses,” he said. “I had $30,000 in student loans and my credit card debt was up to almost $30,000.”  Emmanuel found out about SaverLife while surfing the internet looking for financial tools and signed up in March 2021.   “I saw there were scratch-offs and signed up thinking there was a one in a million chance to win,” he said. “I won a week or two later! I’ve won almost $100 through SaverLife.”  Emmanuel also appreciates that SaverLife tracks his saving rate, and he likes seeing how he compares to other members on the leaderboard. He says SaverLife has helped him build his emergency savings account.   “Before, I probably had a month’s worth of my salary saved. Now, I’ve saved a three-month emergency fund,” he said.  Emmanuel recently paid off the last of his credit card debt.  “Now that we’re debt-free, I’m going to transition to more investing,” he said.   "}
{"prompt":"Daisy’s Story: Dreaming of a Purple House with Chickens","completion":" Meet Daisy, a part-time lecturer and breastfeeding peer counselor, living in San Francisco with her 5-year old daughter.  What do you do for a living?  I currently have two jobs and might pick up a third. I lecture a weekly class at San Francisco State University and I also have a part-time job as a breastfeeding peer counselor at the Women, Infants, & Children (WIC), where I work 20 hours a week. Additionally, I’m trying to take up substituting when I’m not watching my daughter to make ends meet.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My mom had a mindset of save, save, save. However, she didn’t really give us the tools to save and we never actually saw the money – it was behind closed doors. I never knew how much we needed in order to get by. There was a lot of restraint for extracurricular activities, too. I also knew my mom was against credit cards.  When I went to college, my family couldn’t help me out financially. There was essentially no family contribution. I didn’t know what to do. My peers told me, “Don’t worry, you can get a loan.” At the time, I didn’t know the language behind what a loan was. I was the first in my family to get a higher education degree, so I felt like I couldn’t turn to anyone in my family about money for school. We never had those conversations about money.   I applied for my first credit card as an undergraduate. In college, I was more able to manage my credit card because I would never charge my card unless I could pay for things in full. Things changed after I got my master’s degree during the ’08-’09 recession and I had to rely more on my credit card.  Any advice for people looking to be responsible with credit cards?  A while back, I went to get a car when I was unemployed and trying to make it in Los Angeles. What I noticed is that credit is really important for things like this. My good credit score gave me the autonomy to go in and confidently purchase a car. At the same time, my older brother was trying to get a car. But because he had no credit history, he couldn’t get one. I told him he needs build credit to prove to credit companies that he can pay for things.  Credit cards are the pathway to bigger credit. Make sure you have a credit limit AND a personal limit. I feel more at ease when I can pay it off easily.    What are your lowest and highest financial points?  The worst was when I left my daughter’s father. I had no housing. I was unemployed and I carried with me $40,000 student debt from graduate and undergraduate school. Luckily, I had a trusted friend hold some of my savings since my relationship began to show red flags. The cushion allowed me to make the move with my 18 month old at the time  The highest, unfortunately does not seem long lived. But I do try to focus on the short term goals met. I have above a 700 point credit score. I paid off two student loans and now focusing on my third private loan. I have two months of living expenses in my savings and hopefully I can make it three months.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve applied to your life?  “Smart Money Coaching” in San Francisco is a good resource. I was introduced to it at my old job.   Tracking my finances has become really big for me. Now, before I splurge, I log into my bank account and look at what I need to pay off and what I have left. This has really helped me lately. I pause and ask myself, “Do you really need this right now? Can you afford this right now?” It stops me from getting into more debt. Reminding myself about longer term goals has been really helpful in terms of budgeting.   What are your short-term savings goals?  I want to see my private student loan disappear and narrow my student loans down to two.  I also just want to have one job to cover the bills as opposed to having multiple like I do now. It’ll be easier when it comes to my daughter’s care demands as well as affording to pay rent from one stream of income.  What are your goals for the future?  I’d like to own a house. My daughter and I dream of having a purple house with room for chickens in the backyard. We could have fresh eggs. That’s the goal that I strive for. "}
{"prompt":"Cheranda’s Story: Celebrating Sobriety and Achieving her Financial Goals","completion":" Cheranda is an Assistant Operations Manager at a local grocery store in Portland, Oregon.   How have you been?  I’m 42, and this past Monday, I’ve been sober for seven years. In June, I’ll have been at my job for six years. I started off as a prep cook. During the past few years, I got into a home buying program and that’s how I got connected with SaverLife.  I’ve been trying to get sober for a long time. I’ve got six months here, eight months there. But this time I had to detox before going to treatment. I’ll never forget landing in detox and I couldn’t eat or drink and I thought, “I have to change my life. I’m better than this.” It was at that moment that I decided to believe in myself.  Last year, I bought a condo. Before then, I was living in a REACH community development residence. I took a budgeting class there and got an IDA (individual development account) after I completed the course.  Did you learn any money lessons growing up?  I grew up in a foster home, so I didn’t have any money lessons growing up. My sister and I would collect cans for money. To be honest, I got the best financial training in the last three years with the home buying program, budgeting class, and SaverLife.   I grew up in foster care, started drinking when I was ten years old, and have been homeless for most of my life. I got connected with the Portland Housing Center and got into their first-time home buyers program.  What has saving looked like for you?  I needed to save up money to buy a condo. I now also have emergency savings! Right now, I’m looking to buy a car to celebrate seven years sober.  I also always save for SaverLife’s monthly  Race to $100 . Even though I only need to save $100 to be eligible for a cash prize, I like to try and push myself to save more than that.  How has SaverLife helped you?  SaverLife helped me start saving. I appreciate the helpful and informative emails. Everything SaverLife has is helpful actually—the emails,  quizzes ,  articles , text reminders, the  Scratch & Save  cards, and savings incentives. I have a hard time remembering things, so those email and text reminders really help!  I also like reading the  stories  of how other SaverLife members have been able to save.  What financial goals has SaverLife helped you reach? What goals do you plan to use SaverLife to accomplish in the future?   Now that I bought a place of my own, my next long-term goal is to buy a small property on the coast. I love being by the water. Since I joined SaverLife, that goal seems attainable now. I know that if I keep doing what I’m doing I can do that.  I’m proud that I don’t have to finance my car and that I have a mortgage now. Before I got the house, one of my goals was to pay off my debts. I was able to do that and now I’m debt-free.  I’m glad that I have a checking account set up with direct deposit and automatic withdrawals. In order to reach my financial goals, I actually picked up a second job and buckled down on buying things. It was life-changing.  Now I weigh out my options and think differently about whether something I’m about to purchase is a want or a need. There have actually been times where I was going to buy something but then a tip from a SaverLife article would pop into my head and I’d put the item back. The  Money 101 articles  have changed my perspective on money. "}
{"prompt":"Tecoria’s Story: A Lupus Warrior","completion":" Meet Tecoria, a car mechanic and rising poet who lives with her family in Buffalo, South Carolina.   Can you tell me about your jobs?  I work at a mechanic shop with my brother and help however I can. When I’m not working at the car shop, I like to write poetry and post it on Vocal. It’s a place where you can share your work and people can send you money to help fund what you’re doing. I also have my own small business that focuses on healing.   What does a day in your life currently look like?   Because of my lupus, my morning routine can take two to three hours. By the time I make my way to the car shop, I’m fatigued, but I have to be the big sister that my brothers need me to be. And, most importantly, I need to do my job. I’m lucky to have very understanding brothers. They know my situation and help me out in the morning by setting up the space heater at the car shop for me.  When I’m done with my work day, I make flyers for my small business, the car shop, and for my rapper and poetry friends. It brings me a lot of joy to help my friends with marketing and business management.   “I’m thankful for my mom. When I was a teenager with a recent lupus diagnosis, my mom would rush me to the doctor every week, help me manage the medications I was prescribed, and take me to my different surgeries. I saw her cry so many times because she thought lupus would kill me. One day, I came home from a doctor’s appointment upset because the doctor said I wouldn’t live to see 21. But I just celebrated my 28th birthday. My mom is my rock, my queen, and my she-ro. When I can’t move and I’m in pain, she’s by my side. And when I had a total hip replacement, she was right there. I thank her every day and tell her how much I love her!!”   Your mom sounds very supportive. Tell me about her.  She’s always been there for me. She’s a teacher and loves her students as much as she loves her own kids. I know I can call her if I need anything and she’d stop whatever she’s doing to come and help. She was there for me when I was diagnosed with lupus. I actually wrote a poem for her and she said that she’d read it to her students. I want to do more for my mom and provide more for her, but right now I can’t and I don’t know how to make that happen.  How has COVID-19 impacted you?  It’s impacted the car shop because people just aren’t driving as much these days. We haven’t had as much business as we usually do. Also, people just don’t have the money to get their car serviced. I’ve had to work out payment plans with people who have needed work done on their cars.   What would you like to do when things are better?  I want to see the world. I go to Florida all the time and usually take a big trip during the summer, so I’m looking forward to making that happen.  My next international trip will be to Dubai. One of my favorite artists shared a video of Dubai at night when the city was all lit up and I want to experience that for myself.   Are you saving for anything in particular?  Well, I went to the doctor’s the other day and I found out that I was pregnant. I’m going to save up and surprise my mom with a little onesie.   I don’t have financial support from the father, but I know my family and friends will be here for me. My friends tell me, “You don’t need [the father’s] support. You’re so strong.” I have such a positive team behind me.  Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  I’d say my biggest financial achievement is being able to stay caught up on my bills. I got a little behind on my car payment but I’ve been working towards that. Right now, I’m focusing on budgeting for my bills and getting out of debt. I receive a social security disability insurance check each month, so I try to save a little bit but it’s not a lot.  Do you have any student loans you’re paying off?  Yes, I do. I’m on an income-based repayment plan. Because my income recently dropped, my loan provider said that my payments will be paused until May 2021. If my take-home pay increases by then, the loan provider will see if I’m able to pay my loans.   To date, I’ve paid off $80,000 in student loan debt.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I like how SaverLife can keep track of how much I’m spending. I convinced my brother to join SaverLife, too! The Money 101 articles have been very helpful as well. I recently read articles on  how to get out of debt  and  how to buy a house . One of my life goals is to buy a house of my own by the time I turn 30 years old. Once I get to where I want to be in life, I want to give back to my community.  "}

{"prompt":"Megan’s Story: To Value Money Means You Value Yourself","completion":" Meet Megan, an Assistant Supervisor for the Community Housing Partnership in San Francisco.  What do you do at the Community Housing Partnership?  I’m an Assistant Supervisor. I help our volunteer team supervise events and do marketing and partnerships with different programs like the Salvation Army. We work in areas to help prevent our clients from returning to homelessness.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I grew up pretty middle class. My parents worked hard to give us a better life than they had. They tried to focus on savings. I consider myself a lot more fortunate than most people because I’m able to go on vacation.   My dad made a deal with me where he would double the money I received from babysitting if I put it into my savings. That was a good incentive for me.   Any noteworthy money lessons your parents taught you?  Savings was important. My dad used to talk about how money can go really quickly. My parents always gave us money for what we wanted and what we needed. I was very fortunate to get what I needed.  What have been your highest and lowest financial points?  I’ve struggled with homelessness myself. The lowest point was probably when all my money was going to my drug habit. I wasn’t able to save even $5 at a time because it would just go back to my bad habit.  My highest point is right now. I have saved some money right now, but I also do have debt. I believe I have more money now than I’ve ever had in my life.  What’s your advice on saving?  Start saving as young as you can, even if it’s just getting into the habit of saving $25 from every paycheck. If your job has a retirement plan, save there too. Have a savings account that you don’t touch. Once you get into the habit of taking money from your savings, it’s hard to stop.  If you can, put 20% into savings. Have a savings account for rainy day funds or a vacation. Have a goal for your savings. It’s also important to save for emergencies. Reward yourself along the way and do things to acknowledge that you’re saving.   One thing I’m learning is that it’s good to buy food and make it at home. That’s where I could be saving more money. Take time and organize your budget every month. Take time to organize and map out eating 80% of your food at home. This is still something that I still kind of struggle with.   I took for granted growing up with an oven and microwave because now I have a little room and making anything to eat is a huge mess. I’ve gotten too used to the convenience of eating out.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  My father always focused on saving, especially saving for retirement. If you can, take advantage of any savings program that your job has available. Additionally, pay off your credit card bill each month.   What does money mean to you in your life?  Money is a reflection of how a part of me is doing. It’s a very valuable and essential tool. It’s important and it should be respected. I learned the relationship between spending money and how I’m feeling about myself. When I’m feeling good about myself, I’m not spending as much money. When I’m not feeling as well, I might buy things and sometimes end up feeling worse.  What are your savings goals?  I need a surgery that is expensive, and my insurance doesn’t fully cover it.  Also, I would also like to get to a place where I’m making enough income to afford a new apartment that’s located in a safer area. I’m in low-income housing right now. I would like a place with more room, my own bedroom, my own bathroom, my own kitchen. "}
{"prompt":"Jeanette’s Story: Supporting Her Students However She Can","completion":" Meet Jeanette, an academic advisor and college counselor who lives with her two children in the Bronx, New York.   What do you do for work?  I’ve been working as an academic advisor and college counselor for the past 20 years at a college in New York. The COVID-19 pandemic has definitely affected my job. Everything is different. No one comes in for in-person appointments anymore, and we have to wear masks and get our temperature taken every time we go on campus. Before the pandemic, I was working hands-on with students and I had my own office. Technically, I still have my own office, but now I’m working from home. These days, I only go onto campus once a week.  Going virtual has been quite the transition. I realized that a lot of students would rather have that in-person advising and counseling experience. When I was working in the office, I created personal relationships with my students and they’d come in and talk to me all the time. Now we just talk on the phone.   These days, I am counseling students virtually. I believe they’d rather be on campus, but there are still restrictions in place to avoid crowding. This whole situation has been hard on everyone.   I try to keep them focused on their goals and aspirations. I used to have a lot of kids come in and talk for hours at a time. A lot of students have financial issues because they or their parents lost their jobs. And some students are having to deal with personal issues like their grandparents passing away from COVID-19. More than anything, I believe it’s important to remind them that their loved ones wouldn’t want them to give up.  Walk me through a day in your life.  I wake up and roll out of bed, brush my teeth, make some coffee, turn on my computer, help students register for classes, and respond to emails. I have a lot of Zoom calls these days, communicating with my coworkers, supervisors, and students. I always try to reach out to my students whenever I can to let them know that I’m here if they need me.  How do you and your kids deal with virtual school?  My son is in 8th grade and does his work in the living room, and my daughter is in 11th grade and does her work in her own room. On a daily basis, I just make sure they wake up in time for class, ensure their laptops are on, and check on them every so often see if they’re listening to their lectures. In the last couple of months, I’ve really gotten a chance to connect even more with my children since we’re all working and going to school from home.  Tell me about your side hustle(s).  Prior to March 2020, I was driving for UberEats and Instacart. When the pandemic hit, I didn’t want to risk my health or the health of my family. I knew I had to find something different. I got my license to be an insurance advisor and also started helping my friend and her management company. I’m her assistant and she pays me twice a month. I’m a representative for Total Life Changes, so I help sell health products. In addition to all that, I do paid surveys and focus groups when I can. Whenever I get extra money from those things, I put it toward my emergency fund.   My son sometimes works with me on my side hustles. I’m teaching him how to be responsible. He takes half of what he earns and puts that money in his own savings account.    I have automatic transfers to my accounts on a monthly basis. I have the Acorns app for my retirement, investments, and accounts for my children. I also transfer allowance to my children’s savings account, insurance, and emergency funds. I pay myself first. Coming from a childhood where my mother didn’t teach me about saving money, I think I’ve done a good job with my own children.   How do you like to plan out paying your bills?  When I got a divorce a couple of years ago, I was left in a bad financial situation. I had a lot of credit card debt at that time.That’s when I started doing extra jobs to supplement my income. I took a class on financial literacy and financial freedom that really helped me.  From there, I used a budget book to help me keep track of my expenses. I labeled the due dates of the bills and in order to prevent not paying each bill, I set up automatic bill payments. I learned my lesson from the number of times I forgot to pay the bills and had to call the company to beg them not to charge any additional fees.   Tell me more about your childhood and money.  My mother didn’t have much when I was growing up, so when I got older, I realized that I wanted a better life for my children. I want to teach them what I didn’t know. In watching my mother struggle, I realized how important it was to get a good education. To me, education was the key to an independent, financially stable life. I accumulated $15,000 in student loans by the time I graduated college and made sure to pay it off right away. As soon as I got my tax refund, I would put every penny toward paying down my debt. Of course, this was before I had kids so I could afford to pay off my debt like that. When I got older and landed a job at the college where I earned my Bachelor’s degree, I was fortunate enough that the college paid for my Master’s.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I discovered SaverLife through the Budgetnista’s Facebook group,  DreamCatchers. I’ve given so many resources from SaverLife to my students. There’s also a lot of  COVID-19 resources  for food, help with paying rent, and more. A lot of my students are SaverLife members, too.   I like the  savings challenges , different ways to  earn points  while learning, and  Scratch & Save cards . I won $5 once!  SaverLife also introduced me to  FindHelp.org , which has helped many of my students find resources they need. "}
{"prompt":"How do you deal with ups and downs in income?","completion":"It’s in the news all the time: a  record number of Americans  have incomes that go up and down throughout the year. Some of these people work in the “gig economy,” driving for rideshare services like Lyft and Uber; some work seasonal construction jobs; and some perform childcare or freelance work when they can get it.  EARN’s research shows that SaverLife members have fluctuating incomes as well:  70% of Savers experience income volatility.  When you don’t know what your income is going to be every month, that can make it hard to plan and hard to save. We asked some of you: how do you deal with ups and downs in your income?  How Savers manage in times of lower income   Gabriella, a Saver from California, told us, “In a low period of income, we count on my girls or borrow from my parents. In a high period, we set aside money as savings, but something always comes up and we have to use it.” "}
{"prompt":"A DC Saver Uses SaverLife to Reduce Debt and Build Savings","completion":" Meet Naomi, a nonprofit employee living in the Washington D.C. area and using SaverLife to save.  Naomi didn’t learn much about money management when she was growing up. A few years ago, after surviving serious medical issues and parting ways with her husband, she decided to take control of her finances.   Naomi’s goal this year is to get out of debt. When she found out about SaverLife, she decided to take the opportunity to build her financial knowledge.  “For the past couple of decades, I haven’t had a savings account,” Naomi explained. “SaverLife encouraged me to open one and get more disciplined about saving—especially because of the savings match program.”   In the few months since joining SaverLife, Naomi has committed to saving at least $40 a month. She also called her lenders to set up repayment plans for her debts, something she learned about from SaverLife’s financial coaches. One of her biggest financial goals is to save up money to buy a sewing machine.     “A sewing machine will help me create a new revenue stream,” she said. “Right now, I’m saving towards purchases that will help me increase my income.”  Naomi hopes to use this additional income to help her pay off debt and build investments so she can leave something behind for her three adult children. SaverLife has been an essential tool in her savings journey.   “This program is a wonderful opportunity,” Naomi said. “I love that I can log on anytime and look at resources regarding budgeting and other financial matters.” "}

{"prompt":"Felicia’s Story: Can’t Spend It If You Can’t See It","completion":" Meet Felicia*, an Administrative Assistant who lives with her boyfriend in Massachusetts.  What’s your home life like?  My boyfriend and I are currently renting an apartment together. It’s been really good! We both have similar working hours, and we get to sleep at the same time.   What do you do?  I’m currently an Administrative Assistant. You could say I’m a career changer, actually. I got my Master’s degree in teaching originally, and as I was looking for a full-time job, I landed this admin role. I like the job itself and especially the people. The only thing I don’t like is the pay.  What did your childhood teach you about finances?  My parents are immigrants, so they didn’t earn a lot. Anytime they got money, they would save it. I definitely learned how to save from watching my parents do it.  They were actually really good at saving, but they didn’t know the difference between a checking account and a savings account, so they were just kind of putting it somewhere.   I feel like I save, but not as much as they did. I don’t have kids to take care of or a house, but I definitely try to save and I budget every week.  What does a week of budgeting look like?  My main expenses are food, groceries, and eating out, rent (monthly), and transportation (monthly).  What’s been a time in your life that you’ve felt most financially secure?  I think it was when I was little because I didn’t have a concept of money. Also, when I got my first full-time job, I had a bit more income coming in.  How did you manage the income from your first job?  It was the first time that money was consistently coming in. It was more income than I was used to, so I knew that I had to be diligent with how I spent it. At the end of paying all my bills, whatever I had left was for fun. I was very cognizant of my recurring expenses.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  It’d probably be to save your money before you spend it. You’ll get accustomed to saving that amount and only spending what is left over. For example, I set aside 3% of my paycheck every pay period, and that’s money that I just don’t look at.  What’s one thing you know about money now that you wish you knew when you were younger?  I wish that I knew more about high yield savings accounts and investing.  While I don’t know that much about investing, I do know that compound interest is good. I’ve played around with some online calculators and seen how my money could grow over time if invested.  I only wish my parents knew about investing because they could have doubled their money.  YouTube has definitely been helpful. I’m more of a visual learner, so videos help keep me both engaged and informed.  What does financial stability look like to you?  I’d like to get to a point where my boyfriend and I don’t have to consciously budget. Maybe that looks like taking a spontaneous weekend vacation. Or if we had an unexpected expense, it wouldn’t be a big deal because we could afford to pay for it and not go into debt.  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money means fun, freedom, and less stress. If you have money, you may feel less stressed and you can have better control of your time. If you have the funds, you don’t have to be constantly searching for good deals like red eye flights.   What are your thoughts about SaverLife?  I think it’s really cool that savings can be gamified! The digital scratch card I earn weekly is very motivating. I look forward to that email every week. It makes me want to build upon the savings each week and not deplete my paycheck.  I think I’ve won Scratch & Save at least twice. My boyfriend also participates in SaverLife savings challenges and might actually like it even more than I already do!   Anything you’re saving for in particular?  In the short-term, a vacation to Iceland with my boyfriend is definitely on the list! We’ve been talking about going there for so long.   I also have a retirement account, and a certain amount from each paycheck is automatically set aside via direct deposit into that 401(k).   Eventually I want to get a house, but houses here are really pricey. I’m definitely open to moving though if that means buying a house for a more reasonable amount.  *The name of the person in this article has been changed at their request. "}

{"prompt":"Back-to-School Season Looks Different This Year","completion":" August is typically when kids get excited about seeing their classmates again and parents can’t wait to have them out of their hair. But this year’s back to school season looks different. This past June, we asked our members if they were planning to send their children back to school this fall.  A little over half said yes, though a significant number were still unsure. School districts are rapidly adjusting to the changing state of reopening policies. Many are figuring out if distance learning is an option, according to this  NPR article . What does your 2020-21 school year look like?  For people who know their children’s schools will reopen, are you planning to send your children back to school in the fall?   “I work in the school system and I think we should wait awhile longer. The kids are going to have a hard time keeping a mask on all day. I spoke to a few parents and they said they’re not letting their kids come back if it does open in September.” –  Natalie E.  “I think that the school needs to stay closed because the covid19 is still going on this planet. I saw on the news that a kid got sick on the first day of the school day. school should not be open sooner like this because is still not safe at all. I can’t let my son go to school during this COVID 19 because it can affect him at school while other kids are around. I put my family safety first.” –  April J.  “I am sending mine back.

{"prompt":"Lauren’s Story: Money Won’t Make You Happy","completion":" Meet Lauren, a mother of four daughters (including a two-month-old baby!) who lives with her husband in Conway, South Carolina.  What do you and your husband do?  My husband is a produce manager at our neighborhood market. I am current filing for disability.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  Money doesn’t grow on trees. I wish it did, but it doesn’t. You have to work hard for everything you want in life.  I had to work for everything I’ve gotten in my life. I was a hard worker. Even as a 13-year-old, I started a babysitting service, and by 16 I was cleaning houses.  What are your highest and lowest financial points?  My highest was when I was working like crazy  – a day job, a night job, and a weekend job, right after high school.  At my lowest, I was living on the streets. I never want to go back to that. It happened because I’m a very friendly person, and I believe in everyone.  How did you get out of that situation?  I got out of homelessness by moving back in with my dad, then I got tired of that and went to Job Corps. I didn’t end up doing anything with that degree, business occupational skills.  But then I did what I said I’d never do – I got pregnant, got married to some idiot, then he put a knife to my throat. Twenty years later, he overdosed. But by that point he was out of my life.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  When you get a nice chunk of money, don’t blow it. Put some aside, save it. Out of every little amount you get, if you put a bit away, it’ll add up. Don’t mess with it, save it for the rainy days or the moment when you don’t have anything. They come rapidly.  Three of Lauren’s four daughters relax after a day at the pool.  What are your goals for the future?  My goal is to keep my house because on April 2 we closed on our first house, and then April 6 I had my daughter. Things always happen in triples, and the third thing was that my daughter’s birth had some complications.  I want to raise my daughters well, with love and the church. And I need to finally get my disability, because it’s been taking forever.  What does money mean to you in your life?  Not much, it’s just a dollar. Money won’t make you happy. It will for a moment, but if you didn’t have money, you could still be happy, as long as you’ve got love and family and friends. "}
{"prompt":"Kiara’s Story: Maybe Money Can’t Buy Happiness, But It Can Buy Security","completion":" Meet Kiara, who lives in Taylor, Michigan with her 11-month-old daughter and her two young cousins.  What do you do?  I don’t have a job. I take care of my daughter and my two cousins because I have a kinship guardianship for them.  One is my biological cousin and the other is his half-brother. Their grandmother, who had adopted them, passed away March 2017. Originally I had only the older one, but then the person who was taking care of the younger one couldn’t take care of him anymore, so I ended up taking care of both of them. Right now they are 7 and 11.   I want to start doing some work from home, but I can’t do things on the phone right now because of the baby.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I had an upper-middle class upbringing. My parents had really good jobs and rainy-day funds and savings. They both worked for the auto industry.  They taught me that it’s important to create a savings nest egg, but I haven’t had the same opportunities that they had to create that.  What’s the highest financial point of your life?  The highest was in 2009. I moved to Alabama, I had a job that paid a lot more, and I didn’t have credit cards or much financial responsibility. I was doing really well financially.  What’s the lowest financial point of your life?  My lowest point began around 2013. I had a decline in health, which led to me being out of work for a while. I had long-term disability, and then eventually social security disability.  Now is one of my lowest points. I wasn’t prepared to have children when I started taking care of my cousins. For the first three months of guardianship, you don’t receive any financial support. But I still had to buy them beds and clothes. I just had to make it work.  Now I’m working with a consolidation company to get my finances back in order.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  If you can’t afford to buy it, don’t get it. Credit gives you a false idea of setting up a goal. You think, “I’ll start out with this low interest, then I can pay it off.” It sets you up for failure.  It’s okay to have a credit card, but you need to only use it when you know you can pay it off.  What are your goals for the future?  I just want to get a new financial start. I want to be able to save for my cousins and daughter so that when they start off in life, they’re not in the same situation I’m in.   I want to be able to have savings for my daughter, even if she doesn’t go to college, so that she can go into adulthood with a little bit of money.  What do you want to teach your daughter about money?   I want to teach her the things I wish I had known. Education is important, but it’s not worth it to go to college and put yourself in $40,000 or $50,000 of debt just to fit into what society wants from you. A lot of trade schools can get you jobs that pay just as well or better, like being an electrician, as what you could do with a degree from college.  I was always an Honor Roll student, but I didn’t like school. My first year out of high school, I started working. I had two jobs and was happy with that. But people talked down to me, so I went to school and it wasn’t a good fit for me. I didn’t finish and now I have these loans that I still haven’t paid off. I wish someone had told me that I didn’t have to do that.  What does money mean to you in your life?  I know people say you can’t buy happiness, but money would mean happiness to me because opportunities are presented. Knowing you’re secure brings happiness. I would say money brings happiness. "}

{"prompt":"Fabiola’s Story: Achieving the American Dream","completion":"    Meet Fabiola, the Grand Prize Winner of our annual SaverLife  Tax Time Story Contest . While the SaverLife team didn’t get to congratulate her in person, we met her over Zoom!  Tell us a little bit about yourself.  I was born in Peru and my first language is Spanish.I came to the United States in 2012 with my parents and brother when I was 18 years old. My first American dream was to go to high school, but unfortunately, I was not accepted because I was too old to enroll. So I decided to go to the Altos Church at night to learn English.   My parents divorced a year after we moved here, so my brother went to live with my mother in a different city and my father got his own place. I decided to move out and live by myself. I worked full-time and learned English, but I was working a minimum wage job that paid $6.50 an hour, so I had to work many hours. According to the managers, I couldn’t be paid more because I didn’t speak English or have enough job experience. Sometimes I didn’t have money to eat or pay my bills.  So you lived by yourself a year after you moved to the United States?  Yes, it was hard. After living alone and working long hours, I learned that I needed to save money. Everybody should save for their future goals or financial emergencies. Once I opened my first emergency savings account in 2019, I started saving $1, $5, $10, or $20 a week. Every dollar counted.   What kinds of jobs did you have when you started working full-time?   It was mostly in the fast food industry. Once, when I was applying for a job, they told me, “Don’t apply here. We’re not hiring Spanish people. This company hires just white people.”   I said, “Okay. Okay, that’s fine.”  On another occasion, I tried applying for a cashier role at the same fast food restaurant because I wanted to gain experience working in the front of the establishment. The manager told me, “No, because you are Spanish, you have to work in the kitchen.” I quit because I didn’t like how racist the manager was.  You said you took night classes at a church. What was that like?  All the adults at the class spoke Spanish with one another, and I knew I wanted to learn English, so I started teaching myself at home. I tried saving money to pay for classes at Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA). It was $600 per class. I said to myself, “Okay, I’ll start there. Maybe I can learn something that will help me get a better job.” So I saved my money and paid for the class. After I finished that one course, I realized that I would have to work another year to afford my next class. At that point, I didn’t realize that I could apply for FAFSA or federal financial aid.  In 2017, I tried applying for financial aid. After three semesters at college, I landed on Business Administration as my major. Now, I’m planning on attending George Mason University and earning my degree in Accounting. I love numbers and enjoy the classes. The next step is to earn my CPA. That’s my end goal. I want to help people with more than just their taxes. I’d like to work with the administration or accounting department of construction companies.   Tell me about your experience saving for college and applying for FAFSA.  When I moved by myself in 2012, I opened my first savings account. I started saving, but it was just enough to pay for classes. College is very expensive. Fortunately, FAFSA helped me pay for my other classes and books. I reduced my hours at work so I could go to school full-time. I discovered that you receive the most federal financial aid when you’re going to college full-time. If reducing how much I worked and going to college full-time meant a better job in the future, then it was worth it.   Where are you working now?  I do part-time front desk work at a primary care facility. Most of the patients are Spanish, so I can help them through the payment process. While it’s not a free clinic, it’s cheap for a private facility, which is good because a majority of the patients are low-income. I try to help everyone I can because when I was in their shoes, nobody wanted to help me.   Have you had your hours reduced at work because of the lockdowns?  Yes. The clinic has been closed since March because the owner is considered high-risk and also doesn’t want to spread the virus. She’ll still take a few patients here and there.   When COVID happened, I had to take some money out of my savings account to pay my bills and whatnot. I was saving for a financial emergency, and that’s what I used it for.   What was it like to find out that you won the $5,000 grand prize on TV?   I thought there were going to be other finalists there. The news people handed me a microphone and an in-ear headset and that’s when I got so nervous I started shaking. Before I knew it, someone from the SaverLife team announced that I had won the $5,000 grand prize while the film crew recorded my reaction. I was just in shock! When I went home later that day, I drank some chamomile tea to calm myself down.  Do you have any plans for the $5,000?  I’m saving it for my college tuition. I want to take fewer loans out and pay for my education out of pocket. That’s my main goal.  What sparked your interest in numbers as a kid?   When I was much younger, I traveled to participate in different math competitions against other students. Both my parents are engineers by trade, so that’s why I have such a strong interest in working with numbers.  Did you learn about money growing up?  My parents didn’t teach me too much about money. I learned about money through my college studies. I didn’t learn about needing to save for emergencies until I came to the United States.  What’s been a high point for you in saving money?   Being able to pay everything on time has been a high point for me. I never pay late. Opening a savings account has been able to help me with this. I know that even in times when I may not have a job, I’ll still be able to afford to pay bills. I feel more empowered. There’s this kind of power you feel when you’ve built up your savings.   My life’s changed since September 2019. Before joining the savings challenges on SaverLife, I was saving just $5, $10, or $20 at a time. The savings challenges like Race to $100 and  Scratch & Save  have pushed me to save more. And even if I don’t win the challenges that week or month, it’s still good for me because I saved money.   How did you find out about SaverLife?  About two semesters ago, one of my professors introduced me to SaverLife and linked an article from the  Money 101 section . I haven’t taken another one of her classes since signing up for SaverLife, but I want to thank her for introducing it to me. I signed up and linked my bank account on the same day after reading reviews from people who said they enjoyed the website.   I saved about $4,000 total since joining!  What’s your favorite thing about SaverLife?   I like reading the investment articles in the Money 101 section. I started reading those articles because I like everything about accounting and think long-term investing is good. Unlike other site’s articles, SaverLife articles aren’t long and boring. They’re short, sweet, and informational.  I also told my friends about SaverLife. I explained that the website has articles about investment, retirement, and COVID resources. "}
{"prompt":"Maria’s Story: $100 Saved from Every Paycheck","completion":" Meet Maria, a social worker assistant with Tribal Child Protective Services. She lives with her husband and three daughters in Phoenix, Arizona.  What do you do?  My husband is a construction worker and I’m a social worker assistant with Tribal CPS. I enjoy being able to work with kids and help them through problems.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I remember growing up, my mom and dad struggled. When I became a grown-up, I wanted to make sure I wasn’t in those kinds of hardships. Ever since I got my first job, I’ve put away at least $100 from every paycheck in case of emergencies.  Sometimes it was tough for my parents. They worked in agriculture in California, so it was seasonal work. Sometimes there wasn’t work, so they had to be wise with money. We always had enough to pay our bills and get food. But sometimes we had to delay paying for clothes or extracurricular activities until they were working again based on the season.  What are the highest and lowest financial points in your life?  My highest was when I was able to save my whole check and just rely on my husband’s paycheck for our expenses.  The worst was when we had to rely on credit cards because my husband’s work slowed down. That’s what we’re currently trying to get out of now. It feels really good right now to be getting out of this debt. This is an important lesson that we’ve learned from and are able to pass down to our kids.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  One of my aunts taught me how to manage my money. After we got into this problem, she taught me how to save and pay off our debt more quickly.  We sat down and looked at my husband’s income and my income. We figured out how much we could put aside and how much we could spend until we were able to get this situation sorted out.  What are your goals for the future?  I want to have a good savings account for my daughters for their schooling and I want to continue to be financially stable. My oldest daughter wants to work with computers and my 13-year-old wants to be a teacher.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It’s important to me to keep what we have saved. If I was to get a really good deal on a credit card right now, I would turn it down. I know I don’t need that credit card just to buy superficial things. "}

{"prompt":"David’s Story: Only the Essentials","completion":" Meet David, a construction worker who lives with his wife and 11-year-old son in Safford, Arizona.  What’s it like living in your town?   I’ve lived in Safford for 12 years now. Before then, I used to live in Iowa, then Virginia, and then Seattle. Seattle was the best place. I was in the army there.  What’s your profession?  Before I was a maintenance guy, I served in the Army as an electronic device specialist. I’d fix all the equipment, from radios to flashlights. That’s what I did from 1980 to 1983.  Now, I’m a maintenance guy who works for a lady who owns 30 properties. I do everything from remodeling trailers to putting roofs on apartments to painting. Things have been slowing down because everyone is staying home now due to coronavirus. Work is hard right now because one of the guys I count on is in quarantine right now, and I need him to fulfill his work before I get started on the next step. He was exposed to a family member of his who was symptomatic, so he hasn’t been able to work for the past few weeks. I get $15 an hour, and my boss tries to keep me busy, but it doesn’t always work out. What’s nice about work right now is that 12 of her properties are located really close to me, so I don’t have to go too far for work.   That’s been especially nice these days because I’m driving on bald tires. I was going to get new tires as soon as I could afford them, but then all the shelter in place mandates went into effect and the shops closed. The new tires were going to cost me $600 anyway, which is about a month’s worth of work.  What does a day in your life currently look like during the coronavirus shelter-in-place?   Before the world kind of shut down, I would get up and start on whatever project I had at 8am and work until 4pm.   Nowadays, I haven’t been working much, and everyone is more on edge. I have a lot of work ahead of me fixing apartments and trailers, but nothing’s happening because my colleague is still quarantining.  Are you struggling to pay for essentials now that you haven’t been able to work as much?  Right now, I’m worried about paying rent. Thankfully, my landlord hasn’t kicked me and my family out yet. I feel there’s a lot more pressure on me to provide for my family than there was even a month ago.  I’m grateful I’m able to pay for things like the internet though. I’m a month behind, but the company still keeps the internet on because I can still pay for it even if it is a little late. It’s been like this for a year now where I’ve been a month behind on paying for the internet. I’ve only ever had the internet shut down once when I was two months behind in paying for it.  How do your bills compare to your income these days?  Compared to two months ago, I haven’t been able to pay things in full. The rent and electricity are both in one bill, and gas is another bill, but I haven’t been able to pay for either.   How is your son dealing with school at home?  My 10-year-old son just started doing homeschooling this January even before other kids started distance learning. This is because he used to have a teacher that bullied him. Can you imagine that? A teacher bullying their own student. We tried moving him to another school, but it didn’t get much better. That’s when my wife and I decided to just homeschool him instead. My wife now teaches him while I’m at work.  What will you do with your stimulus check if you receive it?  I could pay the rent if we ever got the stimulus check. That would really help. I did my income taxes last year, but unemployment really messed me up, so I’m not sure I’ll even get it.   Before I was a maintenance guy, I used to work at McDonalds. I started at $7.85 an hour and worked my way up to earning $8-$10. New management came in and they treated me so bad that they essentially forced me to quit. I think they did that so they wouldn’t have to pay for the unemployment if they had let me go. The new managers knew that I was the maintenance guy, and yet they made me do things like scrub the kitchen. With the old owners, I’d take my lunch break to drop my wife off at her job because she had the better paying job, and also drop my son off at my mom’s house so she could watch him while my wife and I were both at work.   When I was forced to quit, I filed for employment. Honestly, I didn’t think I’d get it because I had quit. The whole process to start getting benefits took me a month and a half, and I was only on it for five months before I got the job that I have now. After going to court back and forth with my former employer, the state of Arizona decided I owed the state back $5,000 from the unemployment benefits I received.   Now I earn money under the table with the job that I have, but honestly, I’d rather pay taxes so that I can get a refund.  What do you envision your family’s future?  At the very least, I want to be able to afford things again.  Three years ago, a neighbor’s trailer caught on fire, and embers flew to our home and caused it to go up in flames. My truck didn’t make it either. My family and I lost everything, and all that we had was the clothes we were wearing. The city wanted us to clean the burned trailer up, and I didn’t really have the means to do that, but I had to.  When I owned my own property, I didn’t have to pay rent. Now, we’re paying rent because we’re renting a new trailer. It’s been a heck of a couple of years.   What does money mean to you in your life?  It doesn’t mean much at all. I spend most of what I earn for my family, not myself. I don’t make very much as it is because I only work about 30 hours a week.   How do you find out about SaverLife?  I found you guys on the Fresh EBT app and decided to see what it was about.  "}
{"prompt":"Michael’s Story: Make Your Money Work For You","completion":" Meet Michael, a substance abuse counselor who lives in San Diego, California.  What do you do?  I’m a substance abuse counselor. I’ve been doing it for about two years now – midlife career change. Unfortunately, it’s one of the fastest growing professions in the US, which doesn’t bode well for us.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I’m 48, and I came from a traditional family. My father worked all the time, and my mother balanced our household budget. She was good at making the budget go further and managing money.  We’re second-generation immigrants from Germany, and I learned the value of working hard from my grandparents. Spending money well, as well as saving money, was instilled in me from an early age.  One thing I see a lot is when people get a raise or get a better job, then they increase their standard of living and become more debt-ridden. I learned not to do that, and stay below my means. There are always unexpected car repairs and medical expenses.  What’s your lowest financial point?  At my lowest point, I was pretty much destitute. There was a period when that unfortunately happened. I’ve been there, and I’m lucky that it was brief. I had gone against everything I learned, went heavily into debt, and wasn’t able to make ends meet.  How did you make a change?  I had to reframe everything. I had to look at all the situations in my life and make a plan for how to get out of it. Even when I had the money to move into a nicer place or get a new car, I didn’t do that. It enabled me to save money so that I would never go through that situation again.  The main thing I’ve learned about is consumer debt. Credit cards, car loans – I limit myself to the absolute minimum. When I’m offered a high-limit credit card line, I don’t take it. You start to think of it as free money, but then you have to pay it back with tremendous interest!  It’s good to have a credit card in case of emergency. Don’t use them for vacations or shopping sprees. Because it’s not your money! That’s been my biggest breakthrough.  Now I take 10% of my paycheck and I pay myself first. Then I pay all my bills. You work hard, so you need to make sure you take some of that money goes to the things you want.  What’s your highest financial point?  I consider myself at a high point right now. I’m lucky to have savings and money for investing. However small, it’s there and it’s a luxury. It’s a blessing to have that. I treat the money with a lot more respect nowadays than I did previously. I think that comes with my age and wisdom from past experiences.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Pay yourself first – take 10% of every paycheck regardless. And avoid the consumer credit traps.  It’s real simple, real profound, and it really works.  What are your goals for the future?  I want to continue saving money and have money for a down payment on a house in the next two years. That’s my initial goal.  Then I want to continue saving money and start reinvesting money. I used to be an avid investor, and I want to get back into that game at a conservative level. I’m too old to start taking silly risks, investing in risky start-ups or IPOs. I might as well go to the casino at that point!  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money is not the answer to everything, but it’s necessary. It has to be earned, and then it has to be respected. You work for your money, and it should work for you. That’s saving or investing.  We’re in a society where money is 100% necessary. We have to respect what it does and what it can do for us. "}
{"prompt":"Meet Deirdre: A Mom of Six Saving for a Secure Future","completion":" Deirdre works in the data department at the University of Vermont Medical Center. She was selected as one of our 2020 Super Saver of the Year finalists.  Deirdre didn’t plan on being a foster parent. But several years ago, an urgent circumstance arose with one of her coworkers, and she and her husband jumped in to take on a temporary child placement. They’ve since adopted two children they’ve fostered, bringing them to a grand total of six kids.   She didn’t start out as a great saver, and with six children, setting aside money was difficult.   “Every year when we thought we were going to be able to save we either added another child to the mix or something happened with my husband’s job,” Deirdre said.   Deirdre’s savings journey changed when her employer, the University of Vermont Medical Center, introduced her to SaverLife as one of their  wellness incentives . She learned about a SaverLife match program that gave people $60 for saving $20 for six consecutive months.   “Save money and get paid to do it?” she thought. “That’s a no brainer.”   Deirdre completed the first challenge and became an active SaverLife member. She particularly enjoys the articles with financial tips.   “ They’re easy reads ,” she said. “It’s a lot of bang for your buck.”  Before joining SaverLife, Deirdre said the family had very little savings.  Since joining, she’s put away $5,000 in their savings account . Having that rainy day fund has been crucial to teach her children about saving and provide some security for the family. It was a crucial cushion when her husband was laid off from his job in 2020.   SaverLife has taught Deirdre that saving doesn’t have to be difficult.   “It’s easier than I thought to set $20 aside,” she said.   In December 2020, Deirdre was a finalist for our  Super Saver of the Year competition  and won $1,000. She plans to use some of the money to buy Christmas presents for the kids, and they were taking a family vote on a charity to donate some of the funds to. Deirdre also hopes to use some of the money to save for building an addition to their house.   “I can’t say we were planning on having six children,” she said. “We’ve outgrown our small house and have been planning for what feels like years now to do an addition.”   However, Deirdre is committed to tucking money away using SaverLife so they won’t have to borrow as much to complete the addition.   “You only gain in the end,” she said. “Even if you save the money and don’t win the challenge you’ve saved the money.” "}

{"prompt":"Monica’s Story: Reaching Out to her Community","completion":" Meet Monica, an Outreach Specialist who lives with her three children in San Francisco.   How’s your family holding up with all the COVID-19 restrictions?  My youngest daughter just graduated from high school this summer and she’s attending City College of San Francisco. All her classes are on Zoom, which is very different for a lot of students. My oldest daughter was accepted into Columbia University and she’s earning her PhD there. However, she hasn’t been able to move out to New York because of all the restrictions. My two boys are in high school and 4th grade, and they’re both doing school virtually as well. This pandemic has been really tough on my kids.  Tell me more about your job.   I was very fortunate to get a job with the San Francisco Parks & Recreation Department right as the pandemic started. For all the new hires and volunteers, we’ve been doing job training online. That part’s been tough because I’m so used to working with people face-to-face. I’m taking as many training sessions as I possibly can to help me use the technology.  During our  November to Remember initiative , you mentioned that your side hustle was COVID-19 community event planning. What does this look like?  I originally got started with COVID-19 community event planning since my previous part-time jobs were closed due to public health precautions. I was working in the cosmetology and massage therapy field. Additionally, I also worked with a local union to set up shows, greet vendors, and help get their tents set up. From personal experience, I know that hospitality jobs have been hit really hard during this pandemic. In San Francisco, we’re starting to close certain indoor establishments like restaurants, museums, and gyms again.  Fortunately, I still have family and friends that are willing to host small gatherings, which is where I come in to help. Early on during the pandemic, I was dispatched as a Disaster Service Worker (DSW) with the San Francisco Parks & Recreation Department. I learned about best practices for when it comes to physical distancing. These days, I’ve been focused on giving people advice for safely hosting, like graduation drive-bys and zoom birthday celebrations.  I’ve even helped with some in-person events as well, but they’re a little more challenging right now. Even though we say people need to stay six feet away from one another, that’s tough when it comes to things like passing food. In the event that someone is willing to host a small in-person event, I help make sure that the spaces have hand washing stations and everyone has a PPE pack that consists of things like hand sanitizer and a mask. With backyard parties, the public health department recommends keeping them to shorter periods and not having more than 12 people in attendance. The tougher holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming up and we’re working with communities to make sure that everyone can celebrate safely.  Speaking of the holiday season, what does that look like for your family this year?   Here in San Francisco, we just got a notification advising against travel unless it’s essential. My goddaughter offered to come to the city and cook for my family so I could warm it up the day of Thanksgiving and she’d make the same meal for her family. That way, we could celebrate Thanksgiving over Zoom and it would be like we’re having the meal together even though we’re physically apart. The public health department is also advising that no one should be near anybody that’s not in their household.   For Christmas, my kids and I were thinking about having a theme for every room in our apartment. For example, my son would have a Thomas the Train theme, another room would have a Grinch theme, my daughter’s room would have a Nightmare Before Christmas theme, and our living room would have a traditional Christmas theme. We’re very excited about potentially getting a blow-up tree from Party City instead of a regular tree this year. It’s low maintenance, which I like, and something we’ve never tried before, which my kids like!   How do you feel about your financial situation?  I’ll be lucky to have earned $50,000 by the end of the year. I was deployed as a Disaster Service Worker (DSW) with the San Francisco Parks & Recreation Department this past spring, and two months into my job, I was hired on as the Community Development Outreach Specialist. I know I’m very fortunate to be earning income when so many people are struggling to find a job. But with my kids being home more, I feel like I’m spending a lot more money on things like food. I didn’t realize how much I depended on them having lunch at school. It’s tough not to overeat when you’re home for so long. I spend most of my money on things like food, school supplies for my son, and getting my car fixed since it broke down recently. We also had to buy a loft for my daughter so she could have a place of her own to study while she starts her PhD program at Columbia. Since the pandemic, she hasn’t been able to go there in person.   We live in federal subsidized housing and our rent actually increased. Pre-pandemic, I had a savings plan in place, but when the rent increased, it threw me off. For a while, I didn’t know how I was going to save money. Even now I’m still figuring it out.   I’d feel better if I could work part-time doing conventions or cosmetology work, but I just don’t know when opportunities like that will open up again. For now, we have to stay as strict with our budget as we can. The line for the Marin Food Bank is so long nowadays that we have to make an appointment ahead of time. The food bank used to be set up like an open farmers market where you could pick what you wanted, but now the volunteers just put pre-packed bags of food in your car.   What would you like to do after this is all over?  Prior to the pandemic, my kids and I had been talking about spending Christmas in Hawaii for what seems like forever. We’re all huge Disney fans and have dreamed about staying at the Disney resort, Aulani, on the island of Oahu. We just really want to have a vacation to get away from everything that’s going on.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I’ve been a SaverLife member since the mid-2000s when it was  formerly known as EARN . I really like the  savings challenges  the organization offers as well as the  helpful articles . I know I can trust what’s been published.  "}
{"prompt":"Week 4 Debt Quiz Results","completion":" Here are the results from our fourth holiday savings quiz! Scroll through to see what members answered and  take the quiz yourself .  1. I pay off my credit card balances every month.   Paying off your credit card debt every month can save you hundreds—or in some cases thousands—of dollars in interest. This interest you are paying is extra money you are giving to a credit card company, helping the corporation become financially stable instead of yourself.  2. I have a written plan to pay off my debts.   As the saying goes, “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.” Having a plan to pay off debt helps you prioritize your spending and helps to keep you focused. For tips on paying off debt, read  What’s The Best Way To Pay Off Debt?  3. I know exactly how much debt I have and my interest rates.   You cannot control what you do not measure. The first step to paying off your debts is to do an inventory of your debts, the amounts you owe, payments, and your interest rate. If you’ve consistently been making on-time payments, consider calling and asking your creditor to lower your interest rate.  4. My debt is manageable.   Ideally, you should be able to pay off your credit cards monthly. If you are carrying a balance, and it’s not due to a drop in income, it may be a sign that you are living beyond your means. If you struggle to pay your debt’s minimum it’s definitely a sign that your debts are unmanageable. Consider reviewing the blog  What’s the best way to pay off debt  to create a debt payoff plan.  5. I feel confident that I can pay off my debts.   If you do not feel confident you can pay off your debts, remember small amounts add up over time. Even if you can only pay $25 extra a month, it’s a start. Commit to not increasing your expenses until your debts are paid off. Commit additional money (once you have savings) to pay off debt.  6. What are some debt payoff strategies?   The best way to pay off debt is the one you will follow! If you need quick wins, consider the debt snowball; if you are tired of paying interest, consider the debt avalanche. Read  How to Pay Down Your Debt  to help you pick the best debt payoff strategy for you. You can also use a  debt calculator  to come up with a debt repayment strategy.  7. Why should you pay off your credit card balance monthly?   Paying off your credit card balance monthly can save you money and potentially increase your credit score.  8. According to  USA Today , the average American consumer has $6,194 in credit card debt. With an average interest rate of 16.88%, how much money is the average American paying annually to their credit card company in interest?   Paying credit card interest robs you of money you can use to fund your financial goals.  Take the quiz yourself ! "}

I feel for parents who have more complicated factors to consider. ” – Adrienne L.   Almost half of our members said their income will drop if their kids go back to school virtually this fall. For members who don’t have the ability to work from home, taking a pay cut would impact their already increasing costs.  “ I need to work from home too.

Any suggestions for working at home to earn extra money? ” – April J.    More than half of our members said that their #1 expense would be food if their kids return to school remotely.

I was a teenager with lupus being rushed to the doctor’s every week, taking medication, different surgeries, I seen my mom cry so many times because she thought lupus would kill me. I remember I came home to tell her a doctor said I wouldn’t live to see 21. I just celebrated my 28th birthday.. My mom is my Rock, my Queen, my Shero. When I can’t move and in pain she is right there. When I had my total hip replacement she was right there.

I don’t like asking for help but she came thru and is still coming thru in the clutch. 🙏🏽” – @feleeshaf  on Instagram  “I’m extremely grateful for my long time friend that I’ve known for 40 years. We now live in different states. We continue to celebrate our birthdays together since it’s on the same day. She will visit me or I will go to her place. She knows me better than anyone in my life. She supports me and will give advice when appropriate. We talk and share through the year. When I’m down I know she will listen and give support. One person in your life that cares is a valuable asset. I cherish her with all my heart. We are truly sisters.” – Noreen  on Facebook  “Thankful doesn’t even describe the word I have for my dad, a girl couldn’t ask for a better one. My dad has definitely been there through thick and thin. He has raised myself and my siblings practicality by himself, he has worked so hard to give us the things we needed. We may not have got everything we wanted but he made sure we had a roof over our heads and food in our bellies. He has taught me the value of money, and has taught me that money does not give you happiness. He has helped me through everything. My dad is my hole world and he deserves great things. I would give him the shirt off of my back because i know he would do it for anybody else.” – Amanda  on Facebook  “I am most thankful for my son. Many times in my life I have always felt like no one was there but he has been next to me every step of the way. I felt the emptiness before he came into my life now he gives me so much joy he gives me the strength to continue on through each day. I am fighting for him I am fighting for a better future.” – Dymond  on Facebook  My Mom made the best of whatever we had and made it looked as if it were fit for a king and queen.  It was only later as a teenager did I realize that I didn’t see her eat often when I was young or only after serving me or that some of my favorite dishes were made of noodles or eggs and other low cost staples.  But she always smiled and She. Always. Found. Money. To. Save.  I grew to respect her hardwork and sacrifice so much that I would often ask to thrift for new clothes and skipped asking for senior pictures/trips.  I remember being excited to find a dress for senior prom for $20 because it wouldn’t stretch my Mom too much.  My Mom was 19 when I came along, but I am proud to say 40 years later she is a leader in her field of Finance and Technology. She has a bigger budget to work from, but she has the same smile and spirit from when I was 5 yes old eating my Mom’s special noodles. ❤️” – Lauri  on Instagram  We all have that special someone who comes to mind when we think about people we’re thankful for.

{"prompt":"Ja’Net’s Story: Helping People Achieve Financial Prosperity","completion":" Meet Ja’Net, a full-time entrepreneur and mother of two who lives in Kernersville, North Carolina.  What does school look like for your kids right now?  My 13-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter are both in virtual school and will be until at least January 11 of next year. They’re ready to go back to school, but COVID-19 cases are surging again in our area.   Tell me about your job.   I’ve been an entrepreneur for nine years now. Normally, I spend my time traveling and doing speaking engagements all across the country. The travel restrictions have been a blessing in disguise for my business because I’ve been able to reach more people on my digital platform. I’ve been able to grow my online presence and webinar attendance because it’s all online now and more accessible. My main audience is college students, who can now attend my webinars on their phone since everything is digital. And now I can spend more quality time with my kids because I’m not traveling as much. I’ve been able to do things like host a webinar and then take my daughter to tennis—that’s been phenomenal.  I enjoy what I do so much that it doesn’t feel like a job to be. Even yesterday, I was trying to figure out Facebook ads and that alone gave me so much joy! When I’m really in the mood to relax, I’ll watch a Marvel movie.   “My business is  Debt Sucks University  and my main goal is to help others financially live their dreams.”   How did you start your own business?  I was in corporate America prior to starting  Debt Sucks University . I got laid off from my job and  took two years to pay off $50,000 of debt. This all started because I did one presentation and got paid for speaking. After that interaction, I thought, “Maybe I could turn this into something.” Nine years later and I’m still going strong.  What’s the most rewarding part of your job?  I love seeing the “lightbulb” turn on for people when they realize that they can manage their debt and pay it off. I feel like I’m really making a difference when someone reaches out to me with their testimonial of how they were able to pay off their debt.   What does a day in your life currently look like?   I wake up at 6am, journal, pray, respond to and send out emails, then wake up my kids at 7am. My son practices basketball for an hour and my daughter practices tennis, too. We eat breakfast as a family before I adopt the role of tech support specialist for their virtual school. While they’re on their laptops, I set up calls with clients, write proposals for my business, and act as a teacher assistance when they need help. Once they’re done with school, we have about 30 minutes before they have to go to their respective sports practices in person.  Do you teach your kids about money?  Yes, we definitely talk about money when the subject comes up. For example, we listen to NPR in the car and I answer any questions they may have about finances. Earlier this year, my daughter asked what going bankrupt meant. I explained that it was when a company owed people more money than it had coming in. Another example was when they saw our local IHOP close. We had that same conversation about bankruptcy. And when we go to the grocery store, they see what I’ve budgeted for and it’s nice to see them learn that those savings add up over time. Even if it’s something like $0.40 savings on one item, you’re saving money.  Can you tell me more about your financial situation?  I have a spending plan each and every month. I have part of the sports package on Sling and I turn it off for the month before the NBA season comes on again so I can save a little money. Whenever I look at what I’m bringing in, I think, “How can I save for myself and my kids?” I want to make sure their college accounts, regular savings accounts, and Roth IRAs are well-funded.   Do you have any milestones for your business that you’d like to achieve?  I’m looking to expand internationally to London, Ghana, and Canada. There are a lot of expatriates there and I feel like what I teach is still relevant to a lot of them. For example, they could be living abroad but still be weighed down by student debt.  Are you shopping for the holidays this year?  I’m definitely getting my children something. Their grandparents also like to go overboard with the presents. Luckily, my children are pretty reserved when it comes to gifts. My daughter said she wants an Easy Bake oven and a Baby Alive, and those are pretty reasonably priced. And my son would never ask me for a PS5. They’re very into traveling. I like to teach my children the value of experiences compared to material things.   Tell me about your proudest financial accomplishment.  I’ve always wanted to give back to those who gave so much to me. For example, I gave my 70-year-old mother a year’s worth of trips. Of course, this was before the pandemic so we had to move a few trips to 2021, but we still plan on taking them when we get the chance. Before COVID-19 hit, we were in Paris and London for a week. My kids came along, too. You know, those locations in Europe are such landmarks. Places like the Eiffel Tower and London Eye are so iconic, and they’re in all the cartoons they watch. So now when they watch their shows, they realize, “Oh, I’ve been there! I’ve seen that!”  My mother really taught me everything. She was a Human Resources Director and she taught me how to dress professionally. Before my father passed away, both my parents taught me about money.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I discovered you all at  FinCon  last year! I thought it was cool that SaverLife rewards people cash for saving money.  The time between recessions is getting shorter and shorter, and I like that you all are helping people prepare for the future. I also like that SaverLife encourages its members to find the money they can to save and build a sense of financial security. Having a good mindset when you’re working toward financial wellness really makes a difference. "}
{"prompt":"Gabe and Melanie’s Story: The Book-Cataloging, Animal-Rescuing, Debt-Free Duo","completion":" Meet Gabe and Melanie, a book-selling couple who lives with their two kids in Sand Lake, Michigan.  What’s it like in your household?  Melanie : We’ve lived in our old farmhouse in a rural community since 1994. Right now, our two college-aged kids live with us because they’re going to school remotely. One goes to the University of Michigan and the other goes to Michigan State University. They’ve paid for most of their college tuition through grants and scholarships.  We’ve been vegetarian – and now vegan – for 25 years and we’ve always taken in and re-homed animals in need like cats, dogs, chickens, pigs, and goats.  How has COVID-19 impacted your family?  Melanie : My company downsized in February right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. I worked for a large international company that was looking to cut costs. I worked with the company on and off since 1993. Then I took a decade off to take care of my parents and build our bookstore business. Now is the worst time to be looking for a job, and it’s hard to know what’s even safe to do during a time like this. We used my income to pay the bills.  Gabe : I’ve been a bookseller as my primary occupation since 2007, though since COVID I’ve been working part-time as a cleaner at a hospital to help make up for lost income.  How’d you start your business?  Gabe : We used to sell books at shows and through catalogs, but in 2007 we decided to open a physical store. We ran that for 10 years and it was enjoyable, but like a lot of other businesses, you’re working 80 hours a week and we weren’t making enough money to hire employees. We sold the physical business in 2017 and went online. Now we sell our books on sites like Biblio and Amazon. Those sales have increased a little since people are buying books from their home, but it’s nowhere near the sales we’d make in a regular year.  We specialize in a variety of unusual and rare material that we sell primarily to university special collections libraries. But since COVID, many libraries have put a freeze on spending which has really impacted our sales.  Melanie : This grew out of Gabe’s obsession with books. No matter what he was into, he had to have all the books about that topic. Our business is named Bay Leaf Books, and we sell general stock and rare books online and through catalogs.  In a typical year, what kinds of books do you sell?  Gabe : While we sell general stock on our website, we often come across unusual items and it’s nice to find the right home for them.  We’ve sold material as varied as an antique family photo album detailing a trip to Niagara Falls to an early punk zine from the late-1970s. Both went to institutions that specialize in those areas. In the past couple of weeks, we have sold a book on experimental art that was bound in metal and a University of Michigan scrapbook from the 1920s.  Some of these items sell for as little as $20, while some have sold for as much as $20,000, including a large collection of American bookplates that included the ex libris of George Washington.   What does budgeting look like?  Melanie:  I’ve been pinching pennies since I was laid off. I tallied up the price of all our favorite recipes and know how much it costs each week. After couponing and stocking up whenever there’s a sale, I’d say we spend less than $100 a week on groceries. When I see something’s on sale, I’ll stock up on it. I can do meal planning since I’m not working right now. I downloaded Ibotta and Fetch Rewards, which help you earn cash back for grocery shopping. We’ve also saved a little money by not going out as much and eating out.  I’ve been using apps like Swagbucks and Clickwork to work from home. Since May, I’ve earned about $1,000.  Gabe:  It’s a lot of small things we’re not spending money on anymore that helps us save. For example, I don’t go out and get coffee and instead drink instant coffee at home. The lockdown has actually been enjoyable for us since we’re homebodies. We’ve got a buffer of land around us which has been nice, and we don’t mind staying home.  Aside from my books, we live a minimalist lifestyle.  Tell me more about your minimalist lifestyle.  Melanie : For me, the zero-waste lifestyle was a natural progression. My dad had early onset Parkinson’s and by the time he was 50, he was retired. My mom saved every penny and we grew up pretty frugal. As Gabe and I got older, we became more conscious about what we buy. We use cloth napkins that I bought at a garage sale, and most of our appliances are “gently used.” We’ve probably saved thousands of dollars over the years just by buying things second-hand. I’ve also been the book scout for Gabe and I’ve developed an eye for what might be valuable. The adage “reuse, repair, recycle” is not only good for the environment, it’s great for the pocket-book.  What would you like to do when things are better?  Gabe : I’d like to go out and visit my mom in Arizona when it’s safer, but other than that I don’t feel like I’m missing out on much.  Melanie : I don’t feel limited right now. Like I said, we’re homebodies. We have a trail right in our backyard and I’ve been able to see bald eagles, coyotes, and deer.  Are you two saving for anything in particular?  Melanie:  It’d be nice to retire someday. With all the disruptions we’ve had in our lives (like leaving work to help my parents in 2008), our number one goal now is to save enough money so we have funds when we’re old.  Gabe:  During COVID, I’d say we’re saving for general survival (laughs).  What would you say is your biggest expense right now?  Melanie : Definitely the animals. Many of the animals we haven’t been able to re-home have health problems, so that’s a big expense. Gabe has really outfitted our house to accommodate all the animals we have. He recently built cat shelves that are like a cat condo and an outdoor catio.  Gabe : The veterinary bills, vaccinations, and food really add up.  Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  Melanie : We’re not in debt, we don’t have a mortgage or car payment, and we have a good start on retirement savings. We don’t owe anybody anything.  Gabe : We always tried to live within our means and pay off what we owe. If we need a car, we’ll buy a good quality used car that we can pay cash for.  No loans! "}
{"prompt":"Meet Stacie, SaverLife’s Grand Prize Winner of the Johnstown Story Contest","completion":"    Stacie was the  Grand Prize Winner of our Johnstown Story Contest . While we weren’t able to congratulate her in person this year due to travel advisories, we scheduled a Zoom call to meet her!  Where did you grow up?   I grew up in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. I moved back here after college to be closer to family.  What do you like about Johnstown?   Johnstown is a pretty small community. I went to St. Francis College, where I earned my baccalaureate degree in nursing. What I like about Johnstown is that it’s a much smaller community and everybody knows everybody.  Do you still know a lot of people there from when you grew up?   Yeah, surprisingly. A lot of people moved away, but many people moved back like I did.  Who’s in your family?   It’s just me and my daughter, Chaya. She’s going to be a sophomore in high school next year and she’s looking forward to driving. She just turned 15 in May, so next year is the big sweet sixteen.  What does going back to school look like for your daughter?   All the students are planning to go back. Of course, there’ll be a couple of modifications, but they are going to go back to learn in the brick and mortar buildings. That will be good for them because this is the age where building those close friendships is really important.  Are you currently employed?  I was a nurse, but now I’m retired. I can’t work because of my medical conditions, so I’m on disability right now. It was a huge blessing to be able to win the $5,000 from the Johnstown Story Contest. I’ll be able to start a nice little nest egg for my daughter’s college fund because now is when we’re getting ready to apply for all the grants and the scholarships available.   Have you guys been impacted by COVID-19?   Our cost of living has increased. I really relied on school meals for her when she was going to school in-person. I counted on them for breakfast and lunch to help us pull through. Her school ended up having summer programs to keep the students fed, but still the prices of things increased. We felt the price increase a little bit, but it wasn’t as much as what other people probably experienced.  Did you have any savings to help you get through these uncertain times?   Actually, no. We pretty much just live paycheck to paycheck right now, so we can’t plan for emergencies. That’s why I started with SaverLife back in January. After I joined SaverLife, I wanted to try and start saving money. Then COVID-19 happened, so things got crazy. I never had a dedicated savings account before this year, and it was my first time attempting to save for my daughter’s college.  What was it like finding out on TV that you had won $5,000 from the Johnstown Story Contest?  I think the news people were trying to keep it a secret. I kept thinking there were going to be other finalists coming, so that threw me off. In my mind, I thought that there were going to be at least two other finalists coming. I’ve never really won anything before, so I had no clue how these things work.  How has your family and friends reacted?   Oh, everybody was really surprised, supportive, and happy for me. They kept saying, “Oh my gosh, you deserve it so much!”   I went through a lot with losing my father four years ago. He had prostate cancer, and prior to that my mom was actually diagnosed with a terminal illness. That’s why I had to move back to Johnstown. I came back here to take care of both of my parents who were simultaneously dying from terminal illnesses, so everybody was just really happy that I had something positive happen to me.  What are you planning to do with the money?   I’m going to put it in the savings fund that I opened up for Chaya’s college education. Winning this money means that Chaya can have a chance at actually starting college and securing her future. When I opened the account, I had to call it something, so I named it “Chaya’s College Fund.” I’m excited to see her college fund grow.   What did you learn about money when you were a kid?   We were a middle class family and lived pretty modestly. My dad was a businessman and owned three different businesses. He was a steeplejack, and he also invented this pigeon control called Cat Claw. It was a stainless steel pigeon that was as sharp as knives. You put it on the end of church buildings so pigeons couldn’t roost there.  My dad taught me about integrity, saving, spending, and donating. He was very thrifty, too. We probably had money to do all kinds of things, but we just didn’t live above our means. I’ve always really known the value of a dollar and the importance of a good education. One of the first things my dad instilled in me was that it was really important that I went to college. I think that’s why it’s really important to me that Chaya has that chance, too.  Have you had ups and downs with money into your life?   Oh, yes. I’ve had, and I’ve had not. I have a very strong faith in God, so I’ve always let Him get me through the hard times. When we’re weak, he’s strong. When the times weren’t so good, I relied on family, church, and friends. And when times were good, I tried to give back with tithes—whether it’s for my family or the community.  Other than Chaya’s college fund, what are your savings or financial goals?   I want to get her to where she’s financially stable so she can get married and have kids or whatnot. She’s been my main priority for the last 18 years. My financial goals are to support her and help her with what she needs in life.   What’s your favorite thing about SaverLife?   That you get paid for saving money. SaverLife encourages you to keep saving, and the website has all kinds of activities you can do. Plus, it’s a great website to learn about how to spend and invest your money. I also enjoy the free financial coaching that’s offered because I was able to talk to someone and have them answer my specific money questions. "}
{"prompt":"6 Myths About Receiving the Child Tax Credit","completion":" Stop! Don’t know where to start when it comes to claiming the Child Tax Credit?  Take our short quiz to find out .  Myth #1:  “My kid is 17 years old, so I won’t get the advanced Child Tax Credit.”  Yes, you can! This was a significant change that was included in the American Rescue Plan. As long as your child doesn’t turn 18 years old before December 31, 2021, your family will be eligible to receive the advance monthly payments for the rest of the year.   Tip : Check out our  One-Stop Guide  on the Child Tax Credit for more info on how to claim your funds.  Myth #2:  “My ex and I usually switch off who claims our kids as dependents, so I won’t receive the money.”  This is tricky because it all depends on who filed taxes last. If you filed taxes last, then you’ll receive the advanced monthly payments. But if your ex-partner filed last year, then they will receive the advanced monthly payments. Have a conversation with them about how you two would like the payments to work out, and use this  IRS Update Payment Portal  to make any changes after that talk.  Myth #3:  “I get public benefits, so I’m disqualified from getting the advanced Child Tax Credit.”  Incorrect! The federal government wanted to make sure that as many families as possible could receive these payments. If you receive public benefits, such as SNAP, you can still receive the advanced monthly Child Tax Credit payments. Read our  2-minute article  for more information.  Myth #4:  “I have student loan debt, so I can’t receive the advanced Child Tax Credit.”  This is  somewhat  untrue. The advanced monthly Child Tax Credit payments ( see schedule here ) will  not be garnished . However, when you file taxes next year, the other half of the Child Tax Credit that you’ll get as a lump sum refund  may be seized to repay federal student loans  — if you are in default.   Tip : If you defaulted on your student loans,  click here to learn more  about your repayment options.  Myth #5:  “I haven’t filed my taxes in the last few years, so I can’t get the monthly payments.”  If you  DID  fill out the IRS Non-filer form to claim any of the last year’s stimulus checks, you should automatically receive the advanced monthly Child Tax Credit payments. However you received the stimulus checks last year, by check or direct deposit, that’s how you’ll get the Child Tax Credit payments.   If you  DIDN’T  fill out the IRS Non-filer form to claim any of the stimulus checks in the last year, use this  IRS Non-filer tool  to claim the advanced monthly Child Tax Credit payments.   Myth #6:  “My baby was born in 2021, so I can’t receive the advanced Child Tax Credit until next year.”  FALSE: If you have had a baby in 2021, congratulations! You could claim  up to $3,600  through the advance Child Tax Credit.  BONUS  Join our exclusive, private Facebook group  to learn more about our advocacy efforts and get involved.

{"prompt":"Ramona’s Story: Community Activist and Small Business Owner","completion":" Ramona Ferreyra is a community activist and small business owner committed to making a difference in the Bronx neighborhood where she lives. From sourcing masks for essential workers to bringing medicine to sick neighbors, Ramona has used her skills as a community organizer to help everyone around her ride out the COVID-19 crisis. But for Ramona to be able to aid others, she needs support herself.   Ramona and her grandmother, 89, live together in a one-bedroom apartment. Chronic health issues have made it impossible for Ramona to work in most traditional jobs. They rely on sales from Ramona’s clothing business, Ojala Threads (baby and children’s clothes inspired by her Hispanic heritage) and some government support to survive. But with the COVID-19 crisis, Ramona’s sales have dropped dramatically, and she had to cancel all her pop-up events. Ramona and her grandmother’s food stamps ran out weeks ago, and their situation was beginning to feel dire.   “One of the frustrating things about the work that I do in the community is that there is a system set up where you are expected to do the work because you know it’s important, but you’re not paid for it,” said Ramona. Ramona loves the activism work that she does, but it doesn’t support her financially. With support from Humanity Forward through a partnership between Neighborhood Trust and SaverLife, Ramona received a direct $1,000 payment to help her feel a little more secure and get back to doing what she does best: building a better future for her community.   “[The payment] was life-changing,” said Ramona. Ramona used some of the funds to make two credit card payments to pay down some of her debt. She also plans to invest in Google and Facebook ads for Ojala Threads, a marketing strategy she couldn’t afford before.   The rest of her payment she put in the bank, to help her and her grandmother ride out the next few months of the crisis.   It was also important to Ramona to purchase small items, like essentials for her pets — her dog Brownie and her rabbit — and some supplies to make things a little easier for her and her grandmother, including a new can opener and a steam mop. “They’re small things, but they mean a lot. They’re a super big deal.”   “At a time like this, when we have lost three neighbors just in this building…I am already so emotionally exhausted that with the added weight of being poor, there was a time that I wasn’t sure I was going to make it through this because of the financial pressure. And that $1,000, for someone who is used to living on $190 a month–that will last me like three months. For me, this is like a quarterly investment. Look at everything I can accomplish with that money.”  We are so glad we could take a little weight off Ramona’s shoulders. We can’t wait to see what the future holds for her and her business!  "}

Savers Win gave away over $10,000 in cash prizes to Savers all across the country, including a $5,000 grand prize.

{"prompt":"Danielle’s Story: Give Good Out, Get Good Back","completion":" Meet Danielle, a scrapbooking entrepreneur and blogger who lives with her husband, 3-year-old son, and mother-in-law in Florida.   What’s your profession?  I’ve always loved scrapbooking and putting everything together. After making a few for friends and family, I decided to start my own scrapbooking and memorabilia business. It started out as a page on Facebook called Love Sissy Love, but now everything is done through the phone. I recently hired a couple of artistic friends of mine to help out as well! This year, I’ve made about 37 scrapbooks and 14 memorabilia projects.  Scrapbooking is fun, but my real passion is writing. That’s why I started a blog. It’s called Dani’s Rambling Again. When I first started reviewing Amazon products, I was reviewing just about everything and anything. Now, I actually get to work with bigger companies like Dyson. When you get comfortable with the sellers on Amazon, you can pick what you want to review.  Since I’ve had a kid, I’ve been able to review baby and toddler items. Just from reviewing items, I got a whole year’s worth of wipes and diapers! It’s also cool to get snack samples that aren’t yet available in stores.  If you can’t tell, I don’t like working 9-5 jobs. I don’t like clocking in, and I don’t like having to schedule, schedule, schedule. My last 9-5 was at Publix. It wasn’t as great as I thought, and when I got sick, people weren’t really sympathetic. There was also a manager who was pushing me to leave. He ended up firing me for something I didn’t do. I filed a report, and my case went to court, where I ended up winning.  What does the future of your scrapbooking business look like?  Pre-COVID, I was actually trying to buy some shared space at the shopping plaza to sell my scrapbooks. Once I start saving again, that’s where I’m headed. My dream isn’t going anywhere.  What does a day in your life currently look like?  I’m usually woken up by my 3-year-old poking my face or playing with our rescue dog. Then we do breakfast, and while I try my best to feed my little one something healthy, it’s ended up being ice cream recently. After breakfast, we take our dog for a walk, I come home and check my messages and emails, and my husband and I clean the house.  These days, I’m trying to make calls to people who might be interested in my scrapbooking business as opposed to waiting for them to call me. I’m the only driver in the house, so I usually play taxi mom, which sets me back on work. My son’s trailing behind me 24 hours a day Cooking, cleaning, working—that’s pretty much my day. Somehow, it always works out by the end of the day.  How’s life at home been since COVID?  Well, it’s just been me, my husband, our 3-year-old, our puppy rescue, and my husband’s mother. And two weeks ago, we started hosting a homeless pregnant woman in our spare room. I saw her twice at the gas station, and she looked just about ready to pop. The day we brought her home, she actually went into labor. She’s going to stay with us until she can get things figured out.  I’m a big believer in good karma. What goes around comes around, and I hope the good comes back.   What would you like to do after this is all over?  I want to go to the beach. That’s where I reflect. Where we live now, we’d have to drive an hour to get there. I already told my husband, “We’re going to the beach once this is over.”  When we lived in Fort Lauderdale, my best friend and I had the same work schedule, and we’d go to the beach every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. That was our ritual.  What’s your proudest financial achievement?  I have two. The first is when my sister entered me into a poetry content when I was 16. I was up against thousands of people, and I won two years in a row. It made me feel more noticed.  The second was a yard sale my friends and I put together for a buddy of ours. His mother was dealing with cancer in the hospital, and he wanted to visit her. We brought our stuff to the car wash to get more foot traffic. To make more money, we ran a booth called “Conversation with a cool chick” and charged $5. We made enough money to send both him and his wife to see his mother.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  Oh yes, and way more than I wanted to or probably should have. In the beginning of the pandemic, I was buying brands I wouldn’t normally buy because that’s what was available. Now I’m pinching pennies, and I’ve downloaded all those apps where you can earn rewards and save money.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It depends on what day it is. Here are just a few things it means:  “A ways to get by”  “Evil”  “A necessity”  “Doing the funner things in life”  I try not to spend it frivolously because I’m not just taking care of myself anymore.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  Because of SaverLife, I started saving pretty well. I love it! I found out about it through FreshEBT. It’s more interactive now with the  forum ,  Saver Stories , and different ways to  earn points . "}
{"prompt":"How a Dedicated Savings Account Can Help You Save","completion":"It may seem obvious, but it’s easier to save money in a savings account! When you sign up for SaverLife, you have the option to link either a checking or savings account. But if you read the fine print, you may notice that we suggest using a savings account.  Here’s why : our research shows that people who link a savings account are more successful at saving (and we want to help you also save more successfully!). In fact, using a savings account makes you  11% more likely  to save every month compared to a checking account. And that makes sense, right? You may deposit and withdraw money from your checking account every day, making it hard to keep track of the money you’re saving.  But the choice is yours!  On average, we know that people save more in a dedicated savings account – but SaverLife is all about figuring out what works  for you . Over a quarter of Savers link a checking account, and for many of them, that works! We asked some Savers who linked a checking account why they use a checking account to save with SaverLife, and here’s what they told us:   Malea, a Saver from California, told us that she prefers to save in a dedicated savings account, because “I am able to see how much I am truly saving each month and it is very rewarding.” "}

{"prompt":"Latest SaverLife Research: How Work, School, and Parenting Are Impacting Low-Income Parents","completion":" Parents of remote-schooled children are earning less money and facing increased expenses while being forced to make impossible choices between work and family.   Low-income families were battling poverty and inequality, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only made things worse. Now is the time to start redesigning the way we systematically address opportunity and mobility in our society and culture.    Families with children are earning less  Households with dependent children have been impacted much more than households without children. 76% of parents report earning less money now compared to pre-pandemic. This is a 57% increase vs. non-parents.   68% of parents say their children aren’t attending school in-person. This makes it increasingly difficult to earn income.  As of January,  half of all American children are still learning virtually , and even schools that are “open” are often not operating 100%. Most schools have adapted by using smaller cohorts and shorter schedules to adhere to public health guidelines. School children have been learning from home for about a year, which has put a financial strain on parents.  The parents of children who have been remote-learning are 35% more likely to say they have a difficult time earning money than parents whose children are attending school in-person.  Need help finding FREE or reduced-cost internet services? Here’s a  list of resources .    Remote schooling means higher costs  Parents with remote-schooled children are 46% more likely to say their expenses have increased during the pandemic compared to non-parents.  Those same parents with remote-schooled children are 19% more likely to say their expenses have increased compared to parents whose children are learning in-person.  These results are even more striking for people of color, as 82% of non-white members with children indicate that their expenses have increased during the pandemic  (vs. 72% for white members).   Here are additional resources:  SNAP COVID-19 waivers  – these are for people who would typically not qualify but do because of the pandemic The  USDA School Finder  can help you find meals for your kids when schools are closed    What’s driving up expenses?    Compared to non-parents, parents with remote-schooled children are 53% more likely to say food costs drive up expenses.  And compared to parents whose children are attending school in-person, parents with remote-schooled children are 15% more likely to say food costs drive up expenses. Government assistance has not been enough to cover the increased costs.

Pre-pandemic, many members relied on extended family for help with childcare costs, but for the past year, 69% said they weren’t able to depend on their typical support network. Additionally, without the care and support provided by open schools, parents of remote-schooled children are having to cover increased costs for childcare and school supplies.   How the American Rescue Plan helps fix these issues  Below is a breakdown of the American Rescue Plan, also known as the third stimulus, signed into law last week by President Biden.

{"prompt":"Lucinda’s Story: Sweepstakes Savvy & Smart About Money","completion":" Meet Lucinda, a veteran restaurant server who lives with her husband in Tucson, Arizona.  What’s it like where you live?  It’s nice and sunny here in Tucson. I’ve been there all my life. It’s just got that good hometown feel. People are nice, friendly, and helpful.  What do you do?  I’m a restaurant server. I’ve been doing that 35 years, and I’ve run the gamut of the hospitality industry. Sometimes I’ll see celebrities come in, so that’s always kind of fun.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I definitely learned how to save. I got a pretty generous allowance growing up. My mom trusted my older brother and me with a good amount of money to learn how to manage.  If I wanted shoes that cost more than $8 Keds, I had to save up my money to pay the difference. In that sense, I learned to choose my premium items wisely.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Serving is seasonal in Arizona. You make a good six months of income, but the rest of the year you have to budget it out. Having a separate account is nice. I actually use my PayPal account for direct deposit to help me save during the off-season. It’s nice to have a separate account for savings for the rest of the year.   What do you do during the off-season?  One thing I do to offset it is national sweepstakes. It doesn’t pay the bills, but it’s something. All my kids have December birthdays, so that’s how I originally got into sweepstakes. I still have a running list of all the ones I’ve participated in, and I use it to keep track of my current ones as well. Movie tickets, drinks, and popcorn are common, easy wins. I also pick up gifts and gift cards here and there, which helps during the holiday season.  I’m a grandma, so I like to buy all the membership cards for things so I can take my grandkids out. I try to get all those entertainment purchases out of the way.  What kind of money lessons are you trying to instill in your grandkids?  We’ve actually been talking a lot about price comparison and learning the value of their money. They recently got Walmart gift cards from their great-grandmother for their birthdays, and they wanted to buy rollerblades.  Something interesting about Walmart is that stores may price their items differently. I usually check their app to see the price difference. This came in handy when we found rollerblades for $7 as opposed to $33 at the original store where we were going to buy them. Sure, it took 10 more minutes to drive to a further Walmart, but that was a valuable lesson for them for sure. It was worth the wait.  I also use Popcart, which is a browser extension. If you have an item you’re searching for, it’ll look across the web and compare prices for you. My grandkids are now using the app to reference the price of what they’re looking to buy.   It sounds like you love to spend time with your grandkids. How are your kids?  Well, my daughter wanted to be an EMT, which involved school and some 24-hour shifts. She eventually bought her first house. Both my husband and I are proud that she was about to set herself up to be a homeowner. Had we not stepped in to take care of her kids when she was in EMT school, I don’t think she would’ve been able to complete it. Plus, that meant more time with my grandkids!  What are your goals for the future?  I kind of want to retire at some point. I’m just getting ready to turn 53. I’m on what they call “short time,” where you have 10 years until you retire. The ‘08-’09 Recession took away the retirement and savings that my husband and I had built.  I went back to serving after 13 years as a General Manager, so that was a big income shift for me. While it took some time to adjust financially, I was grateful that I could now hang out with my kids. I want to keep spending time with them.  What does money mean to you in your life?  I’ve learned that it’s not the most important thing, but it means being able to pay the bills comfortably and on time. Sometimes it’s worth it to chase every dollar, but ultimately money comes and goes.  Right now, I’m trying to save. My kids are set up and the grandkids are in school, so it’s time for my husband and me to focus on saving these next ten years.  How did you feel about winning $50 from the SaverLife Tax Time Pledge?  I was so excited! I just clicked on it and I couldn’t believe it. The SaverLife site is also really helpful, especially all the info about social security and saving money in general. The information isn’t just for certain types of savers. It covers all aspects of your financial life. The content is very well laid out, and it isn’t overly long. I was really happy that a sweepstakes site brought me to SaverLife.  I’m going to keep the money I won in my PayPal for the off-season. That’s my backup plan. Come September or October, it’ll be handy to buy some food or to do something extra with the grandkids. "}
{"prompt":"Tashana’s Story: Helping Foster Youth Financially Prepare for the Future","completion":" Meet Tashana, a social worker who lives with her fiancé and two kids in Virginia.  Tell me about where you live and what your home is like.  My family and I moved to Arlington, Virginia in December of 2017. Before that, I lived in Erie, Pennsylvania. My fiancé and I got engaged last September. We have very different tactics when handling money. He’s not as enthusiastic to get rid of the debt and likes to stick to making minimum payments. We’ve worked out a way to meet each other where we are financially and find a happy medium when making financial decisions.   What brought you to Virginia?  Poverty. I graduated in 2012 with a Bachelor’s in social work. During that time, I struggled to find sustainable work, so I worked a lot of part-time jobs. The wealth disparity was the worst. The highest paid job I got was $11.25/hour. Before that, $9/hour was the highest. In 2016, I decided to go back to get my Master’s degree, and in 2017 I started applying out of the area.   Interestingly enough,  USA Today posted an article  about the worst cities for African Americans to live in, and Erie, Pennsylvania topped the list. It was a huge risk for me and my family to make that move to Arlington, but it was necessary. When that article was published about my hometown, it was really heartbreaking and a reality check. I experienced systemic racism. Seeing those numbers in black and white made the decision to leave more reassuring.   I’m actually able to help family members a little more. I help my grandmother, who’s experiencing dementia. It’s about a six hour drive to get back to my hometown. If I would’ve stayed, I wouldn’t be in a position to help her in the ways I am.    What was it like living in Erie, Pennsylvania?  I could never have all of my bills paid at once. Living like that for a while, you’re constantly in a crisis mode. I didn’t realize how much stress would stem from that. Now, I can have all my bills paid on time. It’s just completely different. I can actually save money now compared to worrying if I’m going to have enough to pay the bills. Some level of the financial discipline was there, but I didn’t have the knowledge and I had a lack of resources. Getting my Master’s put me in a position to earn more.   Were your kids with you when you were getting your degrees?  I had my daughter during my junior year of college. Right after I graduated, I found out I was pregnant again with my son. They’re the motivation. They help me color in my debt pay-down poster whenever a payment is made. I want to include them in the journey, and I want to put them in a better financial position financially than I was at their age.   Having those hard conversations is tough, but children tend to adapt to situations better than adults. I think having those lessons and having those real-life moments builds character in a child.    What’s your current job?   I have a Master’s in Social Work (MSW), so I work for an organization in DC. I supervise advocates who volunteer to work with youth in foster care. My case load tends to be older youth who will age out of care on their own. I manage the “Preparing Youth For Adulthood” program. We’re actually holding a workshop called “Financially Lit” soon, talking about things like budgeting, saving, etc. When these youth exit the child welfare agency, they can get an escrow account, which the agency matches up to $12,000. We want to encourage them to use this program to build a strong financial foundation. Unfortunately, foster youth are susceptible to financial abuse and identity theft.   I’ve always worked with at-risk populations and had a passion to work with youth. I want to know who they are and not base them on their behaviors.   What does a day in your life currently look like?                                            We assist our kids with school, and then I have meetings and case check-ins with volunteers. I talk about what are the current needs of the youth that we’re serving. Around 3:30-4pm, I start preparing dinner. Then I go outside for a bit. I work on my blog  Hopeful Reality  from 8-11pm. Friday is always movie night in the house, and that’s when I don’t work on the blog. My kids hold me to that. During the weekends, we used to go to church on Sundays pre-COVID, but now we attend online church services.   Tell me more about your blog.  I launched it in Sept 2018, and it was something I wanted to do to document my debt journey. I’ve always been a writer at heart, and this has been a learning journey for me. It’s strengthened my research and financial literacy skills. To me, other people’s stories were so motivating. I was inspired to write about my own struggles with financial literacy and wanted to empower people to share their money stories.   In the Black community, we’re not having those money conversations enough. We need to build a sustainable life and get beyond that paycheck-to-paycheck life. I had a recent friend of mine who’s interested in blogging come to me for advice. I’m sharing with her what I wish I knew when I first started.   Money is a part of our lives. We need to make it work in our best interests. Not having money is sometimes due to a lack of knowledge, but mostly it’s because of a lack of resources.    What are you and your family saving for currently?  Right now, our savings goal is to have 3-6 months of income saved. We’re at the three months mark. After I saved my first $1,000, I realized I wanted to keep beefing up our emergency fund. I also opened up a 529 account for my kids after listening to some financial podcasts. I realized where I am with paying off my student loans, and I don’t want my kids to have student loans if they decide to go to college.   Eventually, we do want to buy a home. It’s such a big task, and I’m so debt adverse. I’m wondering how I can go about it in the most efficient way.   How do you feel about SaverLife?  I actually really like the concept of it. I found the organization when listening to a Paychecks & Balances podcast episode. They had a guest speaker who talked about SaverLife, the Scratch & Save challenge, and how the non-profit made savings fun and motivating.   The amount of resources SaverLife has is great. I’ve even been able to read some of the Saver Stories on there, too. I find it empowering for a non-profit organization to increase positive financial habits to populations that could use the support.  "}

{"prompt":"What Women’s History Month Means to Me: SaverLife’s Coaches Reflect on Their Financial Journeys","completion":" This year’s Women’s History Month is special, coming only a few months after our country inaugurated our first female vice president. The strides we’ve made in the 100 years since the passing of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote have been incredible.  40% of business owners  are women. There are  114% more women entrepreneurs  than there were 20 years ago.  But as great as these strides are, we still have a long way to go to achieve financial equality. The numbers vary, but statistics show a gap between how much women and men earn. We reached out to several SaverLife financial coaches to learn what Women’s History Month means to them.  My Financial Advice for Women, by Tania Brown, CFP  Women’s History Month inspires me to empower women financially. Here is my financial advice for my female clients.  1. Know Your Worth  Don’t assume your employer is paying you what you’re worth. Most likely, they aren’t. I encourage women to use salary calculators on websites like  Glassdoor ,  Payscale , and  Career Contessa  to estimate the average pay for your job.    2. Get Paid What You’re Worth  When I worked for a recruiting agency, I was amazed at how many men had fewer job qualifications yet demanded more money. Even when women met all of the job qualifications, they rarely negotiated their salaries. If you’re underpaid, make your case, and  ask for more money . You’re worth it.  3. Be Your Own Financial Advocate  When using financial services, do not assume the first offer you get is the only option. Single women  pay more for mortgage loans  than men. Women make up 57% of all higher education students but  hold nearly ⅔ of all debt .  I feel honored to work with SaverLife to help women make informed financial decisions.  Stand at the Helm of Your Own Financial Journey, by Maureen Paley, AFC  Women and their finances are relevant and imperative all year round, not just during Women’s History Month. That said, it’s important to remember that this is a month where we celebrate the successes, triumphs, sacrifices, and resilience of women around the world. Many of these victories have been connected to women’s fight for financial independence and self-sufficiency. When a woman’s financial well-being is intact, she is in touch with her values and makes her best decisions. She determines how her money engages with the world.  When I work with female clients, I usually find them excited when they discover or rediscover their birthright to manage their money: to call the shots on how their money gets spent and saved, to stand at the helm of their financial journey. When women get in touch with this internal and innate power, they often meet their goals. In fact, the help, support, and conditions needed to meet those goals tend to materialize on her path. It’s as if the financial goal is cheering that woman on and ready to work for her!  The more we can support the financial wellbeing of women, the more our communities will share in the successes, triumphs, sacrifices, and resilience that we honor during Women’s History Month.  Finding My Financial Confidence, by Lorna Saboe-Wounded Head, AFC  It has taken me years to be confident in my financial decisions. As a young adult, I was unsure of my financial abilities and had a feeling that I wasn’t doing things the right way. It has taken time to become confident in making personal financial decisions and to accept the mistake I have made. In fact, my confidence has increased because I learned from my mistakes.  The women highlighted during Women’s History Month have taken remarkable actions to improve the well-being of women and mothers. Their confidence to pursue their goals and learn from mistakes inspires me to empower women to be confident in making financial decisions.   So, where do we go from here?  We become each other’s top advocates and work together to achieve equality. First, we will have to become our own financial advocates and commit to educating ourselves and the next generation.  SaverLife  offers a ton of resources to help you become financially secure. Second, it’s encouraging and supporting each other in the marketplace. No one will understand the struggles of being a woman in the marketplace or working mom, other than us. The more women we can build up and grow in leadership positions, the quicker we can make the workplace more inclusive. "}
{"prompt":"Tracy’s Story: Keep Going & Don’t Lose Focus","completion":" Meet Tracy, a temporary employment agency employee who lives with her husband and two boys in Katy, TX.   What do you do?  I’m currently working full-time in a temporary employment agency. I was laid off last year, and I had to really cut back on expenses. While I’m glad that I have a job right now, I’m looking for more permanent full-time work. This in-between time has been nice because I have a steady flow of money coming in at the same time I’m applying to more permanent jobs.  I’d like to return to working in the administrative offices for universities. Prior to getting laid off, I worked in data analysis. The job market is changing, so things may be a bit different now in the field that I’m looking into.  I’m trying to do something a little different while also supporting my family at the same time.   What did your upbringing teach you about money?  Well, it’s funny. I mostly stayed with my grandparents when I was growing up. We didn’t talk about money because we just didn’t have it. My grandfather worked in a manufacturing plant and my grandmother was a house nurse, meaning she took care of homebound people. I would only see her on the weekends, and during the week she was a live-in nurse in her patients’ homes.  We tried to save whatever money we had. We had a garden in our backyard, so we were self-sufficient and lived off the land. And we even had a little farm that included chickens, so we had eggs to both consume and share with our neighbors. Also, nothing went to waste on the farm. For example, we distributed most of the parts of the pig to our neighbors.   The local store wasn’t within walking distance. We would go maybe twice a month because everything else came from our vegetable garden and farm.  What was it like growing up with your grandparents?  My grandmother pushed my brother and me to get an education. Both my grandparents felt that school was our job and that we needed to educate ourselves in order to be self-sufficient. My grandma would work extra shifts to get what we needed for school. She inspired me to be a hard worker.  If I have to work a double shift to get what I need, I will. I had to learn about savings accounts, pensions, and retirement funds all on my own. I know that as of right now, I have 10 more years until I can access my pensions from previous jobs.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Don’t take things too personally. Everything we do with money is so emotional. When things look bleak, try to stay positive. I was unemployed for two and a half months, and my family had to survive off of one income. You have to find ways to be positive and cut corners.  Once the negativity starts setting in, you can lose focus. But you have to keep your focus. That’s what I try to do. I have a temporary job right now, but I had to go through four agencies to find something. When one thing doesn’t work, just keep trying and stay focused. Right now, I’m trying other means and mechanisms to find something more permanent.  I put things into high gear and rushed to get a new job. These unemployment agencies required at least 3 interviews a week, and I was getting about 10 a week. After 6 months, I updated my resume to get more interviews. The one good thing about doing so many is that I got used to answering weird questions.  What are your goals for your boys?  My oldest son is 27 and living on his own. I have my 15-year-old and 9-year-old sons at home. My 15-year old son is getting ready to go to college. I’m trying to help him get a music scholarship. We’re researching that right now to try to find something for him. A lot of universities are tuition free if you fall under a certain income bracket, which could really help us.  I also want to get a full-time, permanent position. When I find a job, I have to get a higher salary so my pension contribution stays high and I can receive higher monthly retirement benefits. My youngest will be in high school by the time, and I want to be financially stable by then. Right now it’s hard to save because we’re trying to cut where we can.   The most recent things to go were cable and satellite. We have services that are a lot cheaper than those two options.  How did you feel about winning $50 from the SaverLife Tax Time Pledge?  I was so excited! It was 2 or 3am when I saw the news in an email. I thought it was a joke at first, but I really did win! It came right on time. It was very helpful.  I want to keep the winnings in my PayPal in case of emergencies. That’s what I use my PayPal for—emergencies.  Overall, my goal is to save $500. I’ve only been working at the temp agency for about a week or two, so hopefully I can pay off some bills. You know those Barnum’s Animal Crackers plastic containers with the lid? I’ve already saved two containers worth of extra bills and change. "}
{"prompt":"Glorianna’s Story: 21st Century Entrepreneur","completion":" Meet Glorianna, an aspiring entrepreneur who lives with her husband and youngest son in Las Vegas, Nevada.  How’d you choose Las Vegas?  I’ve been here since August 2013. I came here in 2011 because a girlfriend of mine didn’t want to live alone. She didn’t answer her phone for two weeks, so I was on the streets and stayed in a shelter during that time. At the beginning of the third week, she finally answered her phone. I slept on her floor until I could make things work.  Before moving to Las Vegas, I lived in Oakland, California for 19 years. It wasn’t sustainable. I had to work 2-3 jobs just to pay the rent. It’s much cheaper in Las Vegas.  Do you try to teach your son about money?  My son has autism, so it’s a little difficult. He doesn’t understand the concept of money at all. The value of money is something he’s been learning. I give him household chores to do as a financial incentive, but then he goes and spends his cash at Starbucks. If the chore isn’t written down, he won’t do it.   What do you do for a living?  I’m unemployed at the moment. Currently, I’m building a website on Shopify, but it’s been a month and nothing’s really happened. I’m trying to create a permanent domain for my website. My goal is to become an entrepreneur. Eventually, I’d like to build this website for an online store, make money, hire people, and become financially set.   I have four adult kids, and I want to make sure that they’re taken care of, especially if something were to happen to me.  What did your childhood teach you about finances?  It really didn’t teach me anything. My childhood was all over the place. My mom left then came back. Then my dad left and came back. We ended up on the streets. I just want to make sure that my kids don’t have to go through that.  How did you get from that point in your life to where you are now?  I don’t know. I just put it in my head that I didn’t want to go through life thinking, “What’s gonna happen next?” In general, I try not to worry about the little things, which is difficult because I was recently diagnosed with PTSD and hypertension. I try not to let the situation overcome me.  What are your goals for the future?  First, I’d like to get my website up and running. Second, I’d like to be able to generate more income. But most of all, I want to be able to bring my family physically closer. My daughters live in Virginia and my other son is living in Los Angeles, and I really want to create a bond with my kids who are living out of state.  How long have you wanted to be an entrepreneur?  I’ve wanted to be an entrepreneur since I was 18. Years ago, I didn’t think I could do it because of monetary resources and the fact that my credit wasn’t good. The one thing I’ve discovered in my journey to become an entrepreneur is that it’s hard to get good advice from other people in this field.  What’s your background in website building?  Basically, I’m going to teach myself. My thinking is: if I can teach myself, I’ll be able to teach other people. Google has also been really helpful. I thank Google for everything.  How does budgeting work in your household?  I get food stamps since I’m unemployed, and they’ve been helpful. Other than that, I’m responsible for half our household bills. I’m very independent, and it’s hard for me to have someone else help me. Together, my husband and I have about $4,000 in bills monthly, and I’m responsible for $2,200 of that.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It really doesn’t mean that much. Truthfully, it would be nice to have more of it to afford things and go places. For example, I really want to travel with my son. He loves trains and haunted mansions. I would want to take him to a haunted mansion out in Pennsylvania.   How did you feel about winning $50 from the SaverLife Tax Time Pledge?  I was shocked as hell! I was happy. With me being unemployed, $50 is really going to help. I’m going to use my winnings to help build my business and pay for Facebook ads. "}
{"prompt":"Jonathan’s Story: A Furniture Artist Copes with the COVID-19 Lockdown","completion":" Meet Jonathan, an entrepreneur who hopes to open his own shop with his partner in Akron, OH.  What’s your living situation like?  My partner and I are currently renting to own a house. I’ve lived in Ohio my whole life. It’s a little bit of a quiet farm town.  Has the coronavirus impacted your ability to pay for things?  It’s definitely impacted our ability to pay our rent for the house. While my partner is on disability, work has stopped for me.   My side business of selling redone furniture has slowed down because people just aren’t leaving the house anymore. And even if they are, they can’t pay for the furniture I made because they might be out of a job. I didn’t realize it until recently but staying at home all day and not being able to do anything is expensive.  What’s your profession?  You could say I’m a jack of all trades. Technically, I would be considered a Customer Service Associate. I’ve done all sorts of jobs in that field. I’ve even been a barista.  Someday, I’d like to open up a store of my own that includes furniture I’ve redone.   Could you talk more about what your store would sell?  Well, my partner is a Wiccan, and I’ve always been interested in the religion. I want to incorporate a Wiccan background and hopefully appeal to a different audience. As much as possible, I want to make it just an interesting and fun shop to go into. I love to make art and redo furniture, so I definitely want to sell those kinds of things, but I also want to include homemade crafts from local artists.  How do you and your partner stay grounded in these times?  We’re working on our respective projects and bringing the house up to our standards. There’s always a project to work on.   We are also doing lots of “trash for treasure” hunting. There’s never a dull moment. Monday nights – trash nights – are the most fun of the week. I found a sound bar, a power washer. I’m really into house plants and bookshelves.   We constantly have new stuff coming in and our friends like to go digging in our furniture.  What does a day in your life currently look like?   My grandma recently had surgery to get a pacemaker, so my partner and I are trying to help her as much as possible while still abiding by the quarantine. Most days once we wake up, we try to stop over and help her with what she needs, which includes going to the store if we need to.  Apart from that, we’re working on various projects with the assortment of stuff we get from Monday. Every so often we get friends who come through to purchase what we make. These days, we’re just trying to get the house together and stay sane until the world gets back to normal.  Are you currently looking for a job?   I’m looking for more of a permanent, regular employment so I can afford to do my side projects. At the moment, it’s tough to get a job because things are kind of shaky right now.  When we get our store up and running someday things will be easier, but until then I need a nice payday.  How are you feeling about your situation right now?  My partner and I normally live in our own bubble because we don’t have a TV. However, I’m staying connected to the news through my phone now more than ever. If things start to go south here in Akron, we’re going to head out to Manchester where my grandma is and stay with her. I’ve never seen anything like this before, so I don’t know what to expect, but I try not to get overwhelmed by all the conspiracies and the hype.   It was really stressing me out for a while. I’m just trying to work on our house trying to have some sort of normalcy again.  We’re just trying to do what’s advised and stay home. There are so many conflicting stories. Every day the news is definitely changing. It’s kind of scary, but it is what it is.   What would you like to do after this is all over?  I really want to go to the beach and have a couple of hours of uninterrupted beach time. I just need to recharge at the beach. A little refresher would be nice, or maybe a long weekend trip.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  Actually yeah, I had a little bit of a 401(k) from a past job when I worked for a university. I recently had to cash that in. Once work stopped, I didn’t want to just live off government assistance. When everyone was buying a lot of toilet paper, we needed enough money to sustain ourselves for a bit.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I think it’s a really cool idea! I love couponing and freebies. It’s kind of like a lifestyle trying to kind good deals. There’s a thrill to it. I also like prizes and incentives. "}
