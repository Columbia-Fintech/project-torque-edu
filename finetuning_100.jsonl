{"prompt":"What’s the difference between withdrawing from a 401k and taking out a 401k loan?","completion":" When life happens and there’s a big bill attached, we often scramble to figure out how to pay it. Ideally, an unexpected expense should be covered by your emergency savings account. If you don’t have enough  savings, consider asking for a payment plan or delaying the bill until you get a tax return or bonus.  If those options don’t work, as a last resort, you may be able to use your 401k plan. It’s considered a last resort because the purpose of a 401k  is to save money you may need when you’re older and possibly unable to work. There are two options to taking money out of a 401k while you are working: a hardship withdrawal or a 401k plan loan.  401k Hardship Withdrawals  You take money out of your 401k plan for a specific  IRS-approved hardship  (prevention of eviction, education expenses, etc.) and you’re not returning the funds. Here are a few details you should be aware of:  With few exceptions, the amount you withdraw is taxed. You may also owe a 10% penalty if you remove the money before you are 59 ½ years of age. The amount withdrawn is restricted to what you need to cover the hardship. You will need documentation to prove your hardship and hardship amount. Many employers will not allow you to contribute to a 401k plan for about six months after your withdrawal. If you choose a 401k hardship withdrawal, you can have additional taxes taken out of the amount received. However, many find they still owe taxes or get a much smaller (or no) refund. Talk to a tax professional to make sure you withhold the correct amount of taxes. If you take out a 401k plan loan, your take-home pay will be less because the loan payments come directly out of your paycheck. Adjust your spending to account for the lower paycheck.   401k Loans  You borrow against your 401k plan and paying an interest rate given to you by your employer. The payments typically last 1-5 years. If you are using the money to buy a home, you may be able to take longer to pay. You pay yourself back through monthly payroll deductions.    Because it’s a loan, you typically do not owe taxes, as long as you are making the payments. Some companies may restrict how much you can take out and how often you can request a 401k loan. Contact your 401k plan for more information. If you leave your job, your company may require you to pay the remaining loan balance back in full within a specific time frame. If you do not pay the money back or roll it over within a particular time frame, the remaining loan amount is typically taxable. You may also have to pay a 10% penalty on the remaining balance if you are under 59 ½.  To avoid having to use your 401k plan for emergencies, open a savings account and start with an amount you can easily save (ideally through payroll deductions). If you get a 401k plan loan, once the loan payments end, consider having the former loan amount automatically deducted from your payroll into a savings account. These steps will go a long way into turning an unexpected expense from a crisis to a minor inconvenience. "} 
{"prompt":"What do I need to apply for Marketplace insurance?","completion":" You need some basic information to start the Open Enrollment process.  First, you need to provide information about your household, including household size (including anyone you claim on your tax return). For each of these people, you need some basic information like birth dates, home addresses, and social security numbers.  Additionally, you’ll need information about your best estimate for your 2020 income, how you file your taxes if you have a spouse, your sources of income, and policy numbers from any current health insurance plans. "} 
{"prompt":"What Is APR?","completion":"Your  Annual Percentage Rate (APR)  is the interest you will pay over the course of a year. This doesn’t tell you how much you will actually pay if your interest is compounded in shorter increments. Our loans are usually compounded monthly, or for most credit cards, daily! YIKES!  If you really want to know how much you’re paying on your credit balances each day, divide your APR by 365 to come up with the daily interest charge. "} 
{"prompt":"What are the biggest money sinks that people can cut out of their lives to save more?","completion":" Many people don’t even realize that they have a money sink, much less what their money sinks are. We are so heavily marketed to and conditioned to spend in America. Using a debit or credit card feels so removed from real money that it doesn’t even feel like spending. It’s easy to spend without paying attention.  If you want to find the leak in your budget, take these steps. You might be surprised at what you find.   Step 1: Take an Inventory of Your Spending  Go to your checking account and pull up 30 days’ worth of spending.  It doesn’t matter what 30 days, just as long as they are consecutive. Every time money came out of your account during that time frame, categorize it by writing it down in a category. Some common categories are food, entertainment, gas, and rent or house payment. Feel free to make any category that fits your spending habits.   Next, add up all the categories. Is there one that made you say “WOW! I had no idea I spend that much on (fill in the blank)!” That is the money sink or leak in your wallet.  Step 2: Reflect on Your Goals  Ask yourself, “Does this spending move me towards my financial goals?” If not, you have just discovered the money sink that you should cut out or reduce in order to save more. Now is the time to decide to do something about it. Sometimes, it’s easier than you think. If you stop every morning for coffee, you could be spending over $1,000 a year just for that one item. By simply preparing a cup of coffee at home, putting it in a travel mug, and taking it with you, you have stopped that leak. Now you have money to put towards your emergency fund or financial goals. You also still have the caffeine you need to get your day started.  Step 3: Remember to Enjoy Life  It’s important to note that if it’s something you really want, it’s okay to have it! Make sure you are purchasing it in a manner that is reasonable and doesn’t damage your long-term goals.  "} 
{"prompt":"How to Pay Bills Without a Bank Account","completion":" According to a  report  by the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) in 2019, 5.4% of households in American were unbanked or had no bank accounts. There are several reasons that someone may not have a bank account. Past financial mistakes like too many overdraft fees or bounced checks can make it hard to open a new account. Some people don’t trust banks or have the funds to meet the minimum balance requirements to open a new account. Others just want to avoid bank fees. If you don’t have a bank account, it can be helpful to know your options for cashing checks, getting paid, and paying bills.    How to Cash a Check Without a Bank Account  If you don’t have a bank account, you will probably still need to cash checks. Whether it is your paycheck, your tax refund, or any other source of income, knowing how to cash a check will help you get your money.  The best place to try to cash a check without a bank account is the bank that issued it. If you get your paycheck, for example, cashing it at the same bank where your employer banks is a good option. This is because the bank can verify that the account the check was written from has the funds in it to cover it. This advice goes for personal checks, too. If you can, try to cash them at the same bank they are written from. It is important to note that you will need proof of ID to cash your checks. There may also be a small fee for cashing them since you don’t have an account at the bank.  Another option for cashing your paycheck, tax refund, or other income is to cash it at a big box store like Walmart and Kroger. Similar to banks, in order to cash a check at a store, you will need a valid ID. The stores may also charge a small check-cashing fee. Often these stores won’t cash personal checks because they cannot verify if the funds to cover the check are in the check writer’s account.  Using a Prepaid Debit Card  While cashing your checks and having access to the funds is important, if you want to also be able to pay bills online, using a prepaid debit card may be a better solution. Prepaid debit cards work like debit cards, but you don’t need a bank account to get one. Some prepaid debit cards allow you to have money directly deposited into them. This means that you can have your paycheck, tax refund, or other income sources deposited directly to the card. You can also find prepaid debit cards that will let you deposit checks remotely using the camera on your smartphone.  Paying bills may be easier with a prepaid debit card than cash. You can use your prepaid debit card to make purchases online and pay bills. Some even offer bill pay services. It is important to look at the fees associated with the card you choose. Some charge reloading fees to add funds to the card. Others charge you to get cash from an ATM or pay bills through their bill pay service.  Final Thoughts  Not having a bank account can make it more difficult to cash checks and pay bills. If you want to cash a check and have the cash for spending, cashing the check at the bank that issued it or a big box store may be the best route. If you want to pay bills online, a prepaid debit card may be the answer.  No matter what route you choose, be sure that you understand the fees and requirements. You want to find the option that gives you access to the features you need for the lowest fees. This will help you meet your personal finance needs while keeping the money that you are making! "} 
{"prompt":"Do I Need to Adjust My Spending? 5 Signs You’re Living Beyond Your Means","completion":" In a time of “buy now pay later,” it’s easy to fall into spending habits that lead to debt. We don’t even need to leave our homes to make large purchases, making reckless purchasing even easier.   Here are five warning signs that you may be living beyond your means:  1. You Aren’t Saving At Least 10% of Your After-Tax Income  We are all advised to save at least 10-15% of our income. If you can’t save 10%, then you may be living beyond your means. Savings instruments include 401(k) contributions, emergency fund contributions, investments, and deposits into your bank account.   2. You Have No Emergency Fund  Part of the reason you need to save at least 10% is to have cash set aside for the inevitable emergency. Putting emergencies on your credit card or taking out a loan will continue the cycle of living beyond your means. I recommend that you have 3-6 months’ worth of your monthly expenses set aside.  3. You’re Living Paycheck to Paycheck  If you find yourself with more month than money, you are living beyond your means. Many people believe they do not have the required salary to set aside savings or cannot afford to reduce their current lifestyle.   4. You Use Credit Cards or Take Out Loans to Pay Bills  Believe it or not, many people borrow money to pay their bills. This is a clear sign that you cannot afford your current lifestyle. If you find yourself not being able to afford food, toiletries, and clothes, it’s time to see if you can make changes.   5. You’re Afraid Your Friends Will Judge You  Social media can wreak havoc on your wallet. Do you ever find yourself buying items to please others? Do you buy items just to post a picture on social media? Evaluate what you really need and stop trying to impress others.   If you think you may be living beyond your means, congratulations! That’s the first step to making a change. Next, I’m going to walk you through the  tips I use with my clients  to help them make and execute a plan to live within their means. "} 
{"prompt":"What Is a Credit Score?","completion":"Your credit score is a number that is calculated by a company and sold to creditors to let them know how you have managed credit in the past. This is how your credit risk is determined (how likely you are to pay your debts on time).  FICO  (Fair Issac Corporation) is the most commonly used score by lenders. It can be worth it to pay for your score if you know you will be borrowing money in 6 months to a year. Otherwise, reviewing your credit reports for accuracy and paying any credit accounts on time is the fastest way to build your credit profile.  Photo  by  CafeCredit "} 
{"prompt":"I’m Married and Filed Jointly, Then the IRS Kept My Refund. What Happened?","completion":" Sometimes you don’t realize it is going to happen. You are expecting your tax refund and it never arrives. You may ask your tax professional or call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040.   Here’s what may have happened: they kept the refund because your spouse owes money. This is often back taxes, both federal and state. But it can also be student loan debt, child support, or other government debt.   What Can I Do?  In some cases, you can set up a payment plan so that you can receive future tax refunds. In some cases, couples decide to file Married Filing Separate for future tax filings. But if you pay to file your taxes, this can increase costs to file. More importantly, this can cause you to lose out on credits or deductions that aren’t allowed when filing Married Filing Separate.  Also, this solution doesn’t help you  now .   What is the Injured Spouse Allocation?  Fortunately, there is another path. And you can do this with your tax return or afterwards if you don’t realize the issue until after the return is filed. The IRS has a tax form for this situation. It is  Form 8379 Injured Spouse Allocation . You can file this form with your tax return, with an amendment, or separately after your tax return is filed. “Injured spouse” in this case doesn’t mean physical or mental injuries. It means that one person’s debt is affecting the “injured” spouse’s share of the tax refund. Form 8379 is used to allocate a portion of the refund to the spouse. It is possible that the IRS will determine a different number than you or your tax professional determines by using the form.   Downsides of Injured Spouse Allocation  The disadvantage of the injured spouse form is that it adds to the processing time. When filed with your joint tax return it can mean it will take 11 to 14 weeks to process your tax return. A Form 8379 filed after a joint tax return is processed can take about 8 weeks to process. Realize that it also slows down the pay-off of the debt. Form 8379 has to be filed each year when filing a joint return if one spouse has debt that is subject to collections from the refund.   Is Injured Spouse Allocation Right for You?  The Injured Spouse option can be very helpful because it often allows you to make sure a large portion of the refund is still received. And preserving some of the refund for you to use can make the longer processing time worth it.  One final point: if you have debt that your refund may be directed towards involuntarily, you may want to let your spouse know before it happens. I’ve found that this is one surprise that spouses don’t like! "} 
{"prompt":"Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA): A Free Way to Get Help With Your Taxes","completion":" Doing taxes can be frustrating. When every dollar counts, many of us don’t want to spend money to meet our obligations as a taxpayer. Many of us don’t want to be working in software, hoping that the right questions are asked and that you provide the right answers. This is where VITA may provide a good option for you.  Who Is Eligible for Tax Help from VITA or TCE?  The IRS’s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program has been around for over 50 years. Typically, it offers free tax help and tax filing assistance to:  People who generally make about $57,000 a year or less Persons with disabilities Military service members and families Limited English-speaking taxpayers  Also, the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) program specializes in assisting those who are 60 years of age or older.  The sites for these programs are staffed with IRS-certified volunteers and are often part of non-profit organization. All the volunteers who prepare tax returns must have training that meets or exceeds IRS standards. Some sites have restrictions on whom they will assist and on what level of complexity they will handle. And others may help people with higher income than indicated above. It is a good idea to make sure ahead of time that they can assist you for your particular tax situation.  I have seen non-profits that are focused on one segment of our society offer VITA services to people in other segments. If an organization may be more convenient for you and you aren’t sure they will help you, ask them.   How to Find a VITA Site  You could use favorite search engine to find a VITA site or call around to non-profits to track one down. But I prefer to use the IRS website – after all, they are paid by our tax dollars! The IRS has a  VITA/TCE Locator Tool . In addition to the location, you can find what days of the year they operate (some are open outside of “tax season”), hours of operation, whether services can be provided using languages other than English, contact information, and whether an appointment is required.   Note that some VITA sites assist you in doing the tax returns. Others do the returns for you much like when a tax professional does your tax return. If you prefer one approach versus the other, make sure you ask before you go.  VITA is a good option if you want in-person assistance, if you meet the requirements of the VITA site for assistance, and your tax return isn’t too complicated. Tax prep fees can easily cost several hundred dollars. If VITA fits your situation, you can keep those dollars. My guess is you can find some good uses for that money.  You can also explore  other options for filing your taxes for free . "} 
{"prompt":"What is a good interest rate?","completion":" You may have heard that there are only two kinds of people: those who pay interest and those who earn it. In reality, we all likely end up occupying both sides of that equation.  The first thing to know about borrowing money and paying interest is that how much you pay depends on your credit score. Your credit score is kind of like your financial report card – it demonstrates to creditors your reliability as a borrower. The higher your score, the more desirable you are as a borrower, and the lower your interest rates will be.   What’s a good interest rate for home loans?  According to  NerdWallet , the average is 4.1% for 30-year  mortgages  and 3.6% for 15-year mortgages as of October 16th. If your  credit score  is Good (670-739), aim for 3.75% for a 30-year mortgage or 3% for a 15-year mortgage. If your credit score is Fair (580-669), aim for around 4.75% for a 30-year and 3.125% for a 15-year. Visit NerdWallet’s  comparison tool  for personalized estimates. Getting approved for a mortgage with a Poor credit score is very difficult. Work to increase your credit score or look into  FHA mortgages , which are more accessible because they are insured by the government.  What’s a good interest rate for a car loan?  According to  Bankrate , the average interest rate for a new car loan is just over 5% for borrowers with a Good credit score, 7.91% for borrowers with a Fair credit score, and 12.17% for borrowers with a Poor credit score. For used car loans, average rates are 6.38%, 10.91%, and 16.78% respectively. According to  NerdWallet , the best rate would be around 3% for those with Good or Excellent credit.   What’s a good credit card interest rate?  You may have noticed that credit cards charge much higher interest rates than car and home loans. That’s because car and home loans are secured debt – the car and home pose as collateral for the loans. If you decide not to make your payments, the bank repossesses the property and sells it to recoup as much of the loan as possible. Credit card debt, on the other hand, is unsecured debt. If you decide to stiff your credit card company, their only recourse is to sue you and hope to recover enough from you to make their efforts worthwhile. This makes it much more difficult for credit card companies to collect unpaid debts. Therefore, they demand a higher interest rate to compensate for the higher risk.   According to  NerdWallet , credit card interest rates range from 12.9% for individuals with Good or Excellent credit to 24.9% for those with Fair credit.  Credit Karma  estimates your credit score and lets you shop for loans and credit cards based on your credit profile.  What’s a good savings account interest rate?  Now let’s talk about the more fun side of the interest equation – earning interest. Savings accounts allow you to set aside money for later while maintaining access to it when you need it. Banks compensate you for providing capital to them by paying you interest. Online banks tend to pay the highest interest rates, because the lack of brick and mortar branches decreases their costs. According to  NerdWallet , the going rate for savings accounts at these banks is around 2%.   What’s a good CD interest rate?  Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are offered by banks and credit unions. These accounts pay you interest in exchange for your agreement to leave money in the account for a specific period of time. According to  NerdWallet , a good interest rate for a one-year CD is 2.25%, and a good rate for a 3-year CD is 2.35%. You can use their  comparison tool  to shop for offerings in your area. "} 
{"prompt":"6 Steps for When Your Credit Is Denied","completion":"First, let’s start with the facts.  There’s a widespread fallacy that a score determines whether or not you get credit. The truth is that lenders use a  variety  of factors to make credit decisions. These factors include your FICO scores, but also take into account your income, your employment history, and your credit history.  This means that someone could theoretically extend you credit even though your score is low or decline your credit request even though you have a high score! The decision will depend on the specific creditor’s underwriting policies.  So if your credit application has been denied (or if you didn’t get the rate or terms you want), here are some steps you should take:  1. Ask Questions  Ask the creditor or insurance company how they evaluated your application and whether they used a credit scoring system. If they use a scoring system, ask them what factors are used in their system, and how you can improve your application. By law, the creditor  must provide specific reasons that your application was rejected .  2. Check Your Credit Report  When your credit is denied, do you know that you can get a free credit report? You usually have 60 days to get this free report from the credit bureau that was used for the decision. Before you reapply or apply to other credits, check this credit report for accuracy.  3. Dispute any Inaccuracies  If you find inaccuracies in your credit report, it’s important to contest them so that they don’t affect your future credit applications. Check out this  sample letter  that you can use to dispute information on your credit report.  4. Write an Explanatory Letter  In addition to inaccurate or incomplete information on your credit report, you may also feel that there are extenuating circumstances that a creditor should know. In some cases, it may even be helpful to  add a short explanatory statement to your credit report .  5. Think about Why You’re Applying for this Credit  This is a great time to revisit your financial goals and plan. How does this credit fit into your short, intermediate, or long-term goals?  6. Take Measures to Improve Your Credit  Consider using a credit-building product, like secured cards or second chance accounts. And focus on the areas that have the greatest impact on your credit, such as a history of on-time payments.  I also want to caution you to avoid predatory lenders if you are denied credit. Be your own advocate and don’t accept credit that has unreasonable terms and conditions. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Start Couponing","completion":" Using coupons can be a great way to stretch your grocery budget. Whether you save $2.00 or $25.00, that is money that you can put towards your financial goals. It’s easy to get started, according to  The Krazy Coupon Lady .  What to Buy with Coupons  She suggests when you are starting out, focus your energy on the expensive items. These are things like laundry detergent, diapers and baby formula. Make sure you are only buying things you need. Don’t be tempted to put items in your cart just because you have a coupon. Buying items that you will never use, no matter how much you save, is still a waste of money.  Where to Find Coupons  You can find inserts of coupons in the Sunday paper. The Krazy Coupon Lady suggests going to the local recycling center for these, or buying discounted Sunday papers on Monday. If you absolutely have to buy a paper on Sunday, try the dollar store. Paying for coupons can negate your savings.  You can also find coupons online. KCL’s data base is a great place to start. There are also P&G coupons that you can bring. Using files or an accordion file is a great way to keep your coupons separated into categories so you can easily find the savings.  How to Use Your Coupons  To start saving, make a list of the items you need to buy. Then go through your coupons and find any that you can use for this list. Pay attention to requirements on the coupon. You may have to buy two, or there may be a certain size you have to buy in order to use the coupon. Also, check the expiration date. Make a note of this on your list so you don’t have to go through the coupons and waste time while shopping.  Once you go to the checkout, hand the cashier your stack of coupons and start placing your items on the checkout counter. When the clerk is done, they should scan your coupons and you get to watch your bill go lower and lower! It’s the best part.  Use Coupons to Grow Your Savings Account  When the clerk gives you your receipt, you should be able to see the “total savings” for that purchase. That is the amount of money you need to transfer to your savings account when you get home. You were going to spend it anyway, so you might as well move that money so that you can save it for something you really want.  It takes a little practice, and you have to get organized and find a system that works best for you, but it will be worth it once you start. "} 
{"prompt":"Are you ready for tax time? The scammers are too!","completion":"The end of the year often feels hectic. We’re spending time with family, celebrating the holidays, and planning for the coming year. This is exactly what scammers rely on to separate you from your hard-earned money.  What to do with a possible scam  The first step to staying ahead of scammers is to be very critical of all communications you receive that aren’t from a trusted sender. When you receive a text, email, or call about taxes:   Stop  – Scammers use people’s anxieties about taxes against them. They count on you taking action without looking too closely, so don’t immediately respond.  Scrutinize  – Look closely at the communication and scrutinize what you see. A good resource for this is  Taxpayer Advocate  from the IRS. You can also contact your state’s Taxpayer Advocate services –  find yours here .  Take Action  – If you believe you’ve been targeted for a scam, report it to your law enforcement’s non-emergency number or the  FTC .   Signs of an imposter scam  Be on the lookout for scams on the phone, online, through email or mail, as well as in person or at a business. Here are some red flags, from the  Consumer Finance Protection Bureau :   Sweepstakes  – Someone tells you you’ve won a sweepstakes that you didn’t enter  Asking for Payment  – Someone tells you to pay taxes or fees upfront  Urgency  – Someone pressures you to take action, such as making a payment or  giving personal information , immediately  Government Official  – A fake government official contacts you to confirm your winnings  Threats  – The IRS says they have seen  a surge of phone scams  where fake IRS agents threaten arrest, deportation, and license revocation.   Choose a trustworthy tax preparer  You’re trusting your tax preparer not only with a lot of personal information, but also to accurately represent you to the IRS. Most tax professionals are ethical and provide high-quality services, but  be on the lookout for scams and identity theft . Watch out for tax preparers who:   Promise very large tax refunds  Ask you to sign a blank return  Tell you how much of a refund you’ll get before looking at your records  Charge fees based on a percentage of the refund   Filing taxes can be stressful, so make sure your preparer is truly on your side and is not taking risks with your financial future.  Can you file for free?  Start by  determining whether you’re eligible for free tax preparation . If you are, this is most likely your best choice because the volunteers are trained to help you find all of the tax credits and exemptions that you are eligible to claim.  If you want to do your taxes on your own, see if you’re eligible for  Free File , which allows you to use brand-name software for free.  70% of tax payers  are eligible to use Free File. Why pay to file your taxes when you use the exact same software for free? "} 
{"prompt":"You Can Probably File Your Taxes for Free. Really.","completion":"    Sign up for SaverLife  to take the Tax Time Pledge and enter to win cash prizes.  We know taxes are important. The government needs revenue to do things it does for our society. We want to comply with the law and pay the taxes we owe. Plus, most of us want a refund if we are entitled to it. But having to pay to get that done, when our tax situation seems simple, can be frustrating. Luckily, there are excellent free options!   Some quick links if you want to go straight to one of the options above:  IRS Free File website VITA information  and  VITA locator Free File Fillable Forms IRS2Go mobile app  to check your refund status, make a payment, and find free tax prep assistance  File Your Taxes Using Free File  Some of us have been frustrated in the past when we see an advertisement for free tax filing. But then we go to do our taxes, and it turns out that we still end up paying. Here’s the solution. The IRS has a program called IRS Free File. The IRS partners with many tax preparation companies that you may recognize to offer their software for free. It can help you find an option for totally free tax filing software. You’ll be able to know before you get too far in if it will truly be free for your situation.   There is an income limitation. For the 2021 Filing Season (2020 tax returns) your income must be less than $72,000 for 2020 to qualify. This limit is based on your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). For most people, AGI is close to or the same as their Gross Income. Also, the more complicated your return, the less likely you’ll be able to get it done and filed completely for free. The IRS has a list of  forms that the Free File partners offer for free . Partners only have to offer the most commonly used forms for free. One of the advantages of Free File is that once the 2021 Filing Season gets started, you can compare the different Free File partners offers through IRS.gov.  If you file state income taxes, check whether you will be able to file your state tax return for free through Free File. As we roll into the 2021 Filing Season, you’ll be able to  check out Free File partners . A disclaimer: while Free File makes it easier to find a truly free option, there can still be cases where something comes up after you’ve chosen a software option. You may need to file a form that isn’t supported by the free option offered by the Free File partner. Unfortunately, this is normal due to our complicated tax code. If you haven’t filed your return yet, you aren’t obligated to pay. You can go back and choose another option or look for a free in-person option.   Get Help Filing Your Taxes with Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA)  The IRS’s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs offer free basic tax return preparation. But there are qualifications. Generally, VITA is for people earning $57,000 or less, but some locations may go higher. There is also VITA support for people with disabilities and for taxpayers with limited English. Most VITA programs are for older folks, for minorities, and for military service members. If you find one that focuses on a group that you aren’t part of, they may still be able to help you. It doesn’t hurt to ask!  Much like the IRS Free File program, there are typically limitations on the type of forms a VITA location will do for taxpayers. And some locations offer guided tax return assistance, meaning you will be doing the tax return with their help. So, if you want them to do it for you, check ahead of time to see what they offer. You can find a location using your preferred internet search engine, but I prefer the  VITA locator tool . Check during tax season (usually January – April) if you can’t find a location close to you outside of tax season.   File Your Taxes the Old-School Way  You can go to IRS.gov, print out the forms, and read the instructions to do your tax returns by hand. The IRS prefers that taxpayers file tax returns electronically and many states encourage taxpayers to file their state taxes electronically. It will generally take you longer to prepare a tax return on paper. Plus, processing a paper tax return will almost always take longer.

{"prompt":"Do I Qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness?","completion":" To participate in Public Service Loan Forgiveness, make sure that you meet all the requirements. You must have the right type of loans, the correct occupation, a full-time job, and the correct repayment plan. Plus, you need to make eligible payments for ten years. After ten years, if you meet all of these conditions, you are eligible to have the remaining balance on your student loans forgiven.  Let’s dive into each aspect of Public Service Loan Forgiveness qualifications.  Check if You Have Qualifying Loans  Only Direct Loans qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. You can check your loan type with your student loan servicer. If you do not have direct loans, you can consolidate your student loans into a direct consolidation loan to qualify.    Does Your Employment Qualify?  Any full-time job in a government organization at any level or with any non-profit organization that is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) will allow you to qualify for public service. Government positions include jobs at the federal, state, local, and tribal level. Time spent working full-time for the Peace Corps or Americorps as a volunteer can also count as qualified employment.  You must work a qualifying job for ten years. But you should note that you don’t have to work the same qualifying job for the entire time. Nor do you have to work your ten years consecutively. But you do need ten years of qualifying payments while working for a qualifying employer to complete the program.  Qualifying Repayment Plans and Payments  To qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, you have to be on the right repayment plan. All income-driven repayment plans currently offered by federal student loan servicers qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness.  Payments made under the standard repayment plan also qualify. But this plan allows for full repayment of your balance in ten years, so there would be nothing left to forgive. For your payments to count, make all of your payments no later than fifteen days after your due date and always pay the full amount indicated on your bill.  Submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness  Employment Certification Form  annually to be sure that your employer qualifies for the program. I recommend filling this form out every year even if your employer has not changed. This will help you be sure you are still meeting all the requirements of the program.  Note that there’s only one student loan servicer that is a part of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, FedLoan.  If you have a different servicer, when you fill out the Employment Certification Form, send it to FedLoan, and your student loan servicer will be changed to FedLoan.  ***  After completing your 120 payments, fill out and submit the  Public Service Loan Forgiveness Application for Forgiveness  to be sure your payments are counted and your loans are forgiven.

{"prompt":"I just completed a chapter 13 bankruptcy. Can I apply for a personal loan?","completion":"“Hi, I just completed a chapter 13 bankruptcy and would like to know if I can apply for a personal loan. Thank you.”  Submitted by David N.  Thanks for your question about life (and credit) after bankruptcy. This is a common situation and the good news is that getting  Chapter 13 debt relief  is not fatal for your financial future.  Is a personal loan the right choice?  If you are planning to obtain a personal loan, consider the following before applying:   What’s the point? What will getting the loan do for your situation? Will it help you pay higher interest debt? Do you need it to pay living expenses or other financial goals?  How will you manage the additional financial responsibility of the personal loan?  Are there other options? Can you increase your income, lower your expenses, or a combination of the two?  How will applying for a loan impact your credit score?   Applying for a personal loan  If you feel confident that getting a loan is the right financial choice, consider the following:   Be proactive – get your credit report so you know what the potential lender will see.  Create a budget based on your current situation so you know exactly what you can repay. You likely did this step during the Chapter 13 process. Has anything changed since then?  Shop around and consider all of your potential lenders:  Credit unions (they tend to be more willing to look at your entire situation, not just the bankruptcy)  Online peer lenders  Avoid predatory lenders    What interest rates are being offered?  Are the repayments (of the new loan) manageable considering your Chapter 13 repayment plan?  What time frame is best for repayment? How will that impact your other financial goals?   Getting a personal loan is not a substitute for building a money management strategy to stabilize your financial situation. But if it can help you reduce the “cost of money” by lowering the interest rate on existing debt, it may be a good move. "} 
{"prompt":"How Can I Involve My Kids in Everyday Budgeting and Financial Decisions?","completion":" The home is the perfect place for kids of all ages to learn and practice personal finance. Here are some specific ways you can involve your kids in everyday budgeting and family finances, all while teaching important life lessons.  Consult Your Kids When Making Your Monthly Budget  Let your child know that you’re looking ahead to the next month and ask them for input on the family’s budget. This is their opportunity to give you advance notice of expenses they think are coming up. Maybe there’s a special school or sporting event that has a cost. Maybe their birthday is coming up. Your preteen son may tell you his shoes are getting tight ( again ) and he needs a larger pair of shoes.  Of course, your child may also want to add an item that the family cannot afford at this time. This is a perfect opportunity to teach one of the tougher lessons of personal finance. Some good things that we want need to be delayed so we can meet the family’s needs first.    Involving Your Child in the Budget Is a Win for Both of You  This will help you to craft a budget that looks ahead and foresees expenses, instead of keeping them as a bad surprise during the month. This will help the child by modeling the importance of creating a monthly plan for how the family’s income will be spent, saved, or given away during the coming month. It will also help them with the fundamental skill of thinking ahead and planning for the future. That skill will serve them their whole life.  Tip : A monthly budget is a helpful financial tool. If you’re not yet using it, check out this  SaverLife article .  Give Your Kids Insight into Your Daily Finances and Decision-Making  This is easier than it may sound. Think about what financial tasks and goals you have and then, age-appropriately, let your kids in on those things by talking to them as the task naturally occurs. For example, most parents are encouraging (maybe begging) their kids to turn off the lights when they are not being used to “save electricity.” Now take it a step farther and share with your child the electricity bill. You can note that it’s often higher in the winter when you need to heat the house and discuss what things in the house use electricity. You’re building knowledge and connections between a lifelong task (turning off the lights) and its impact on finances.  Note : Choose topics that are helpful for your child to have a positive lesson in personal finances. Financial information that is stressful or involves conflict should be left to the adults in the family.  Help Your Children Understand How to Find Trusted Financial Resources  Today, marketers and those who make money off of particular products are offering lots of advice. But be aware that they are offering advice that helps them, and not necessarily you. So, who can you trust? The first place I recommend for financial education resources is the federal government’s consumer protection agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  The CFPB’s mission is to make sure “banks, lenders, and other financial companies treat you fairly.” The CFPB has free resources for consumers, parents, and educators on nearly any financial topic you can imagine.  Their goal is to help you “make informed financial decisions and build financial skills.” For teaching personal finance to kids, see their section  Money as You Grow .  Many resources are available in English and Spanish.  Experience Is the Best Teacher  In addition to the ideas above, I’m sure you’ll see many opportunities to involve your child in personal finance and budgeting. They may not thank you now (although some will), but their grown-up selves will surely appreciate and benefit from your efforts. "} 
{"prompt":"Should I itemize my deductions or take the standard deduction?","completion":" The goal of deductions is to lower the amount of taxable income the IRS will use when calculating the amount of tax you owe. The decision of whether to itemize your deductions or take the standard deduction comes down to one question.  Which deduction is bigger and will lower your tax burden more?  Currently, the standard deduction for a single filer is $12,200 and for married filing jointly it’s $24,400. If your itemized deductions equal more than these, you will want to itemize using form Schedule A.  What can I itemize?  Listed on Schedule A, itemized deductions include:  real estate property taxes home mortgage interest charitable contributions state and local income taxes casualty and theft losses  There is a section on the form for Other itemized Deductions. You can find instructions on the  IRS website .  If the total itemized deductions from your Schedule A are less than the standard deduction, use the standard deduction. If the itemized deductions are greater than the standard deduction, use the itemized deduction amount. "} 
{"prompt":"6 Easy Steps to Set a Budget that You’ll Actually Stick To","completion":"Whether it’s something you need or something you want, creating a budget can help you keep your spending in line so you can reach your financial goals.  Creating a budget may seem daunting, but this video walks you through setting up a budget that you can actually stick to. Once you know what your goal is, creating a budget to achieve that goal comes down to six steps:   Know your income : Make sure you’re using your net income (how much money you bring home),  not  your salary. Taxes, insurance, and 401k contributions may all cut into your income before you actually see that money.  Determine your fixed expenses : These are expenses that don’t change much throughout the year, like rent or mortgage, car payments, insurance, and student loans.  Determine your variable expenses : This includes expenses that change based on how much you use them, like your phone bill, groceries, clothes, and entertainment. You have a lot of control over these expenses.  Prioritize : Determine what’s really important to you. What do you feel is truly necessary in your life? Take an honest look at what you truly need, and what you just want. You may find that it’s worth it to you to sacrifice some of your variable expenses in order to reach other financial goals.  Follow your spending and review monthly : Hold yourself accountable by following your spending every month. It’s easy for small expenses to start adding up!  Keep track : Find a way that works for you to track your spending. There are lots of options out there, from old-fashioned pen and paper to an online app.   As the video explains, budgeting is doable; you just need to commit to being disciplined, planning your expenses, and prioritizing them thoughtfully.

{"prompt":"How to Teach Your Kids to Budget for Their First Jobs","completion":" First of all, congratulations! Your teen has their first paying job. This is a milestone and a time where they’ll learn new things about work, life, money, and themselves. This is an excellent time to teach foundational principles and practical budgeting. Your teen can also earn more financial independence.   Save. Spend. Give.  All the things we can do with income boils down to these three essentials.  Save : Setting aside money, which will be spent in the future.  Spend : Buying items or services to meet current needs and wants.  Give : This includes gifts to charities and religious or church-based giving.  Your Teen’s Money Style  Your teen (and you) likely naturally lean towards being a spender, saver or giver. This is your  money style . It’s important to encourage balance. If you have a child who really just wants to spend money, help them see the benefit of saving for a future need or want. Perhaps you have a tender-hearted giver or a devoted saver-only. They’ll need your perspective to understand it’s also healthy to spend for their own needs and wants. Meet your teen where they are at and help them grow from there.  Set Goals for Each Category  Help them to set written goals for each category. They can ask themselves these questions.  Save : What future needs or wants do I need to plan for before they happen?  Spend : What current needs or wants do I have? Give : What values or causes do I want to support?  Practice Budgeting  Every month, before the next month begins, your teen should estimate how much income they expect to earn that month. Then reflect on their written goals and document how much of their money will they save, spend, or give. This can be very simple at first, and can expand as the teen earns more or has more goals. If they work more or less during the month, they can adjust their simple budget to show what actually happened. Here’s a sample:  Jamie’s Budget, April 2021  Income : 10 hours X $12 an hour babysitting = $120        Expense : Where is it going? Save 70% of earnings ($84) for my goal of $240 for an art class in July 2021. Spend 20% of earnings ($36) on one new book & one movie with friends. Give 10% of earnings ($12) for charity or church. This adds up to $120!  You can increase financial independence and support the practical skill of budgeting by giving them more responsibility for their discretionary spending. Discretionary spending is the fun stuff: special clothing, entertainment, etc. They’ll get to practice on a small scale the decisions and choices that grown-ups make when they have limited amounts of money, but many wants. Your child may have to choose between a new clothing item and an evening out with friends (post-pandemic). They may have to decide whether to buy something now at a higher price, or shop around for a sale price. They’ll have to prioritize, which is a key life skill.  Start Simple  These tips are just the beginning, but it is helpful to start simple. Your teen can build a solid, personal finance foundation, through balancing  Save, Spend, and Give , setting goals that address both future and current desires, and monthly budgeting. "} 
{"prompt":"Debt Consolidation: What is it and is it right for me?","completion":"If you’re dealing with multiple loans, chances are you’ve heard of debt consolidation (think of those obnoxious radio or tv ads). But what exactly is debt consolidation? Put simply, debt consolidation allows you to consolidate all of your debts into one payment. This will combine all your debt amounts, and it  may  offer a lower interest rate –  but not always .  Secured or Unsecured?  Debt consolidation comes in different forms, including secured and unsecured. If your debt consolidation is unsecured, that means that it is still a signature loan. If it is secured, you have to put up some asset (like a car or house) as collateral – which you are then at risk of losing. Some people use a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay off credit cards, but in my book, that’s a big risk and can have many consequences including high costs and even foreclosure if you are unable to pay the debt.  Debt Consolidation, Debt Settlement, and Debt Management  There’s a dizzying array of options out there that may help you with your debt. Debt  consolidation , settlement, and management all refer to different processes with different drawbacks and benefits.  Let’s start with debt settlement. This is when you negotiate for a lower rate or balance. Debt management is when an intermediary company negotiates on your behalf with your creditors, then you pay the debt management company and they pay your creditors.  Questions to Ask Before Choosing Debt Consolidation  Depending on your circumstances and the options you have, debt consolidation may or may not be the right choice for you. Here are things I want you to think about and research in making your decision:   What are the fees?  What are the interest rates? Use a  Debt Consolidation Calculator  to check your consolidated rate. Be careful because the rate is sometimes higher on consolidation loans (and don’t forget the fees!).  What is your budget? Use a calculator to make an honest assessment of what you can afford to pay towards debt reduction.  Do you have an emergency fund? Balancing debt reduction and saving is tricky – but my word of advice is to always  put  yourself  in the front of your line . Saving for emergencies, even a small amount, is a good habit to build.   DIY Debt Consolidation  Beyond the many debt consolidation options on the market, I want you to also consider building your own consolidation plan using zero interest cards or short term lower interest loans through a bank or credit union. But as always, make sure you’re still asking yourself the central questions I’ve outlined above.  Your Money Mindset  I’ve often seen that consolidating debt actually leads to acquiring more debt: the newly consolidated debt plus new debt from continuing to use credit cards. Here’s where your money mindset comes into play. Whether or not you opt to use debt consolidation, you may need to shift your behaviors to meet your financial goals and to be successful with tackling your debt. You may find that creating your own debt management plan is best for your money AND your mind.  Where to Learn More  Debt consolidation is complicated, and there’s a lot to consider when deciding if it’s right for you. Nolo, my go-to online resource for legal issues,  walks you through some additional important considerations , including a more in-depth comparison of choosing a secured or unsecured debt consolidation plan. Another great resource is  this article  from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  Whew! That is a TON of information on debt consolidation. Consolidating your debt is a big choice, and I want to make sure you’re equipped to make the right decision for you. "} 
{"prompt":"What’s the difference between money market, savings, and checking accounts?","completion":" Although these types of accounts are similar, they have important differences.   What is a checking account?  A checking account is designed for day-to-day use. There are many options when it comes to checking accounts. The most popular options are free and allow you to make as many withdrawals as you want. Sometimes the bank or credit union will require a monthly automatic deposit into this account, and some checking accounts pay a  very  modest interest rate.  What is a money market account?  A money market account is technically a checking account, but with more restrictions. Money market accounts often have a $1,000 minimum balance requirement. If your balance drops below the minimum requirement, some banks will charge a monthly service charge. You are limited to six withdrawals a month on this account, three of which can be checks. Due to these restrictions, the account pays higher interest than a normal checking account. The interest rate is often tiered, so the more money you have in the account, the higher your interest rate.  What is a savings account?  A savings account also has limited withdrawals, but usually only a $100 minimum in order to avoid a monthly fee. This account generally has a higher interest rate than a checking account, but lower than a money market account.  Other types of bank accounts  Banks and credit unions now offer “hybrids” of each of these accounts. Each account type has their own requirements and benefits to entice you to bank with them. The market is quite competitive and new products are always being added. Shop around to find the account that is best for your banking needs! "} 
{"prompt":"Steps to Get Retirement Ready at Every Age","completion":"You’re never too old or too young to prepare for retirement. Sure, starting early is best (you can do more with less), but if you’re just getting started, focus on what you CAN do rather than what you missed out on.  Here’s the deal.  If you’re in your 20s:  Get ready!  Start NOW and save regularly. Include retirement savings as part of your monthly budget and create a habit of saving. There are a lot of options and choices, but just keep it simple (and consistent). A friend of mine offers some  solid and trusted advice  on getting started early to increase your chances of retiring comfortably, or even EARLY.  If you’re in your 30s:  Get focused!  Start by  running some retirement calculations  to get a snapshot of where you are now and what it will take to reach your goal. It’s easy to think you have plenty of time but I promise that if you take care of your “older self” today, you’ll be happy you did.  If you’re in your 40s:  Get serious!  Do everything you can to shift your savings into high gear. If you are behind, keep debt low and prioritize long term savings. I like  these tips  to help you get on track even if you are starting with no retirement savings at all.  If you’re in your 50s:  Get creative!  If you haven’t started saving you may need to create a plan that includes options for working longer. Numbers matter, so check out tips for the younger folks and then turn your attention to creating the life YOU want in retirement. My favorite book on this topic is  The Number  by Lee Eisenberg. Check it out. (Literally! Save your money and see if you can find it at your local library.)  What does your retirement look like?  “Retirement” means many things, so first decide what it means to you. When I was 44, I realized I was not going to have enough to retire at the traditional age of 67 (my full retirement age according to the  Social Security Administration ) so I knew I would have to come up with a solution. I chose to go back to school and that meant longer work life AND student loans. Now, if I hadn’t been willing to do that I would not be writing to you right now (see, we would have BOTH missed out) but I took the (calculated) risk, found something I love and became an expert. This means that I’m going to be working well into my 70s – but doing something I love! "}

Let’s talk a little bit about the golden rule of saving:  pay yourself first .  So many people say, “I’m going to wait and save after I’ve paid all my bills and I’ll save what’s left,” but we all know what happens then. Very seldom is there anything left.  So the idea of paying yourself first is to prioritize taking good care of your financial future by putting yourself in the front of your bill-paying line. That’s right, sometimes it’s even helpful to think about paying yourself as a bill that you pay, putting a little bit aside each month. It doesn’t even really matter how much it is.

{"prompt":"My kids are 4 and 7. Is it too late to open a 529?","completion":"“My son is 7 and my daughter is 4. Is it too late to invest in 529 plan for them? What would be a better alternative to save for their college and financial future?”  Submitted by Stella D.  It is never too early or too late to start saving for college (or for anything, for that matter). Here are a few things to keep in mind:  What’s the Big Picture?  Plan your savings with your  entire  financial life in mind. For instance, if you have high-interest debt, create a repayment plan that reduces or eliminates that before you go all-in on saving for college. This is a common dilemma because most of us have multiple financial goals and we want to accomplish them all. Minimizing or eliminating debt will free up more cash to save and will reduce the interest you pay.  With that out of the way, there are a few options to save for college.  Benefits of a 529 Account  A  529 account  is a tax-advantaged savings plan that has many different uses for college or education funding. The tax advantage is that you don’t pay taxes on the investment gains if you use the funds for qualified education expenses.  529 accounts are popular because family members and friends can contribute on birthdays and other occasions. While this may not be exciting to your children when they are young, it will certainly put a smile on their faces when they are off to college.  Most often, the asset allocation (picture a pie chart of different types of investments) begins to lean toward a more conservative approach as your children get older.  Because you are starting later, you may need to be more aggressive with your saving amount to reach your target. Figure out that amount using this  college savings calculator .  Other Options  Other than a 529 account, here are some of your options:   Pre-paid tuition if you know where your child will attend school.  UTMA/UGMA (UGMA stands for the Uniform Gift to Minors Act. UTMA stands for Uniform Transfer to Minors Act) custodial accounts. The tax breaks may not be as generous and you cannot control how your child spends the money once they reach 18 (or 21 in some states).  If your child is earning income, consider a Roth IRA which can be used for qualified education expenses and can serve as a base investment for their future. It’s a good way to start them thinking about saving for retirement while they are young!  Parent retirement accounts  are also an option. Look carefully at all of the impact on your long-term financial preparedness before taking this step.   Building Your Savings Plan  Whew, so many decisions and those little ones grow up so fast. Saving for the future is ALWAYS a good choice and fortunately you have several choices (which is sometimes a challenge, right?). Let me break it down:   How much do you think your child will need? Use that calculator I mentioned above to come up with an estimate.  How much can you afford to save? (Got a budget?)  How many years before your child heads off to college?  Are you likely to need that money for K-12 education?  Is your child likely to be eligible for need-based scholarships?   The  “I Have A Dream” Foundation  provides individualized social, emotional, and academic support to young people from low-income communities from kindergarten all the way through college, along with guaranteed tuition support. This is just one of many programs in the U.S. designed to help families save for college.  As you face all of these facts, keep in mind that even if you are unable to save  all  of the money your child will need to attend college,  research shows that saving a little goes a long way , so choose an approach and then take action.

{"prompt":"How Early Should I Start Talking to My Kids About Money?","completion":" Do you ever wonder what is the right age to talk to your kids about money?  Or what should you be talking to your kids about to help them understand and manage money well?   Talking About Money Is Probably Easier Than You Expect  Most kids are naturally interested in money, or the things that money can buy, at an early age. This may come in the form of the tempting candy in the grocery check-out line or a desire for french fries from the drive-thru. You can use this natural interest to help your children build foundational financial thinking skills that will help them throughout life.   Use Daily Life Events to Teach Your Children Key Financial Principles  Where Does Money Come From?  It’s understandable that children don’t always know where money comes from. To them, our cash or credit card just appears from our purse or wallet. Make the connection for them that the money you spend is earned through work. Maybe you leave the home to go to work, or work from home, or maybe your work is taking care of these precious children. Whatever the case, help them understand the connection.  Another way we receive money is from gifts. If they receive a birthday gift, they learn that money sometimes comes as a gift.    Explain Wise Purchase Decisions  When you are out shopping, explain the choices that you are making when you choose one product over another. You are looking at the price, how much you need, the quality of the item, and how suitable the item is for how you’ll use it. If they’re trying to choose between two items, talk with them about the benefits of each item, and the downsides of the item. Ask them what is most important to them. This helps them flex their decision-making muscles.  Working Toward a Long-Term Goal  Another lesson to share with your children is that it can take time to meet a financial goal. Perhaps you’re building an emergency fund. You can involve your children by telling them about your goal and sharing specific examples of the trade-offs you make to put money aside for those goals. When you reach a milestone toward your goal, celebrate with them. Make some noise and do a happy dance together!  Understanding that many of our goals take time and perseverance, and even that there are setbacks along the way, will help them in many areas of life.  Teach Them about  Needs Versus Wants  This can be tough for children. In the moment, a drive-thru french fry may seem like a need. Here you have the opportunity to teach them that food is a need, but the particular type or method of getting food is a want. For example, you could help them see that for the same amount of money you can make many more french fries at home using the bag of frozen fries and even more using a bag of potatoes bought at the grocery store. This small teaching moment will help them see the difference between a need (the priority for your family’s money) versus a want (a treat and nice-to-have after our needs are met).  Here’s the example I might use to talk through with your kids:  French Fry Options Medium Size (Drive-Thru): ¼ of a pound for $2.99 Frozen Fries (Grocery Store): 2 pounds for $2.96 Bag of Potatoes (Grocery Store): 5 pounds for $2.67  Ask your kids which they would choose and why, and talk to them about the trade-offs of time, convenience, quality, quantity, and money.  Get Some Fun Help from Kid Experts  Sesame Street has a fun website called  Finances for Kids . On the site, there are videos of Elmo learning about these financial fundamentals. What will Elmo decide to buy with his dollar? What will Elmo learn about where money comes from? Cookie Monster and kids relate to how it can be tough to wait for things they want. There are also printables for parents and caregivers and other resources to help your little one.  Lifelong Financial Learning  Your money discussions with your children will change and evolve as they grow older. The conversation may change from the candy at the grocery check-out, to the latest fashionable clothing, shoes, or technology, to money decisions related to work, college, or a trade school. However, the key principles are understanding where money comes from, how to make wise purchase decisions, and needs versus wants. These will be constant themes that will serve them well at any age.

{"prompt":"Your Guide to Getting Out of Debt","completion":" There are a couple of ways to get out of debt and back on track. It may seem overwhelming, but you can do this!  It’s time to budget  To start with, make a budget. Total up all your monthly take home pay.  Next, subtract all of your expenses. You will want to subtract your housing, car, gas, food, entertainment, clothing, and insurance, just to name a few.  Where is your money going?  If you aren’t sure where your money went, go to your checking account online. Take a 30-day period and categorize all your spending. If it’s groceries, put the dollar amount under the heading “groceries.” Do the same for eating out, snacks and drinks, entertainment, clothes, or any other category you discover.  Add up the columns so you have an idea of what you spend on each one for a month.  Put it all together  Put your expense figures into the budget. Then subtract the total spending from the total income. Hopefully you have a positive number. If not, go through each category and decide where you can cut back until you do have a positive number.  Doing this will allow you to free up extra money to put towards your debt, and will also keep you from going further into debt because you are running out of money each month.  Your debt reduction plan  To set up a debt reduction plan, I recommend  this free website . You will put in all of your debts, including the dollar amount owed, the interest rate, and the minimum payment. From there, you put in the extra money you have to apply each month. It will calculate how long it will take you to get out of debt, and even print you a calendar showing how much to pay monthly on each debt.  Is credit counseling right for you?  Another option is to work with a non-profit credit counseling agency.  They will negotiate lower payments, a lower interest rate, or both with your creditors. From there, you pay them a small monthly fee along with the total new monthly payments and they make your payments for you.  This can be extremely helpful if you are feeling overwhelmed, are receiving phone calls, or can’t get out from under the debt due to huge interest rates.  You can find a legitimate credit counseling agency with the  National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) .  The burden of debt can be overwhelming. Making a plan to tackle this debt can help lower your stress level and allow you to see a way out. With some hard work, you can be debt free.   We’re all rooting for you! "} 
{"prompt":"5 Tips to Stay Out of Debt on Black Friday","completion":" Your No-Debt Black Friday Survival Guide  As a veteran, I often get eye rolls from my kids when I use military analogies to describe events. But as a financial coach, I can’t help but see Black Friday as an epic battle. You’re knee-deep in the trenches of holiday shopping goals and you’re experiencing the rapid fire of sales ads coming at you from everywhere: TV ads, mail, emails, texts, and Facebook ads (my daughter says Facebook is like Instagram for old people, so fill in the blank to whatever social media site you use). Without a survival plan for your finances, you are one flashy Black Friday sales ad away from going into debt. You have to prepare both financially and mentally for Black Friday.     I know from experience. I was going through “mom” guilt right as I saw a flashy Black Friday sales ad for a $150 toy that is a “must have” if you “really love your 3-year-old kid.” This was too much to bear and I bought the toy. At Christmas all she did was play with the box and completely ignored the toy. To date, that’s the most expensive box I’ve ever bought.   Below is your “No-Debt Black Friday Survival Guide” with the mission to protect your finances from debt at all costs!  1. Assess Your Resources  Write down who you want to buy gifts for on Black Friday. Review your spending plan to see how much you can spend on Black Friday without going into debt or compromising your other financial goals. Once you have this number, write it in large print, circled and highlighted on top of a sheet of paper and go to step 2.  2. Define the Mission  Using the sheet from Step 1, write down exactly what you want to buy on Black Friday BEFORE Black Friday and why you must buy this item. Write down how buying this item will impact your ability to reach other goals like getting out of debt, buying a house, or even finishing your holiday shopping without going into debt. Decide if it’s really worth it. Remember: A sale is not an excuse to buy an item you cannot afford.  3. Examine Your Enemies for Weaknesses  If after doing #2 you still want to shop on Black Friday, the next step is to examine your enemy (the store) for weakness, which are sales ads. Start early and research your favorite store websites along with  Black   Friday   websites  to find the best deals.  4. Map Out Your Shopping Battle Plan  Map out where and when you are purchasing your items. You are committing to only purchase the items on your plan and nothing else as well as to stick to your budget. If you need motivation, write “No Debt Black Friday” at the top of your plan to keep you focused.  5. Triage If Needed  If you have a Mercedes shopping list with a Kia holiday budget, you may have to triage. This means deciding who you’re going to give gifts to and how much you’re going to spend on each person.  Get creative! One of the best gifts I ever got was a voucher from a friend offering free babysitting. And one of my friends gave me an awesome homemade cake. If you have young children or super cute animals, use these weapons of mass cuteness to your advantage:  Snap pictures on your phone and print them at your local CVS, Walgreens, or Rite Aid or use your home printer Shop for inexpensive picture frames at your local dollar store or thrift store   Give as inexpensive gifts!  With a survival plan you can emerge from Black Friday victoriously conquering tempting sales ads without debt.  "} 
{"prompt":"How to Pay Down Your Debt","completion":"“The ONE aspect of our financial lives that causes the most distress”  (cue Jeopardy music)  “What is DEBT?”  Correct!  Yup, you guessed it (or maybe you’ve lived it).  Debt is the number one cause of financial stress in the U.S.  The “right” way to pay off that debt is a constant source of confusion. Even financial experts can’t agree on the best approach to tackle this debt trap. Fortunately, we have a tool that makes setting up a debt elimination plan a walk in the park.  PowerPay  is a free tool that helps you quickly set up your debt payment plan AND shows you exactly how long it will take to be debt free. You’ll input your outstanding balance and the interest rate for each of your credit accounts and like MAGIC you’ll have a repayment plan that puts you on track to no debt.  Two strategies for paying down your debt  There are two basic approaches to debt elimination.  The “avalanche” method : paying the highest interest first. This saves you money in the long run because you’ll get out of paying more in interest. The avalanche method is usually the best method if you are trying to reduce the amount of interest you pay.  The “snowball” method : Pay off your smallest balances first, as quickly as possible. As you pay down smaller debts, you’ll have more money to put towards your bigger balances. you may want to choose the snowball method if you think getting some early wins will help motivate you.  Should I save or pay down my debt?  Many people ask, “Should I save OR pay down my debt?” We recommend a balanced approach to these two financial goals. It may make sense to reduce your saving while you pay down the debt, but don’t ELIMINATE savings. Remember,  paying yourself first  is the golden rule. Plus, you need emergency savings in case something unexpected happens. Even if you just save $20 each month, you will continue the savings habit you started.

{"prompt":"How to track and trim your subscription costs","completion":" The subscription industry is huge in our world today! The average person spent  $237.33/month on subscription services  in 2018. These services include internet, cell phone coverage, streaming services for video and music, food delivery, health and fitness apps, and more.  With the vast number of subscriptions you can sign up for and the large portion of your monthly budget that they can consume, it’s important to keep track of all of your subscriptions. Be sure to cancel or pause any you aren’t using to save yourself money.   While there are apps and websites to help you keep track of your subscriptions, sometimes for a fee, I think you can learn a lot by keeping track of them yourself. Not only can you do it for free, it also will give you better insight into what you are spending your money on and whether or not some of your services are worth it. There are two methods that I recommend to my clients when trying to keep track of all their subscriptions in our crazy world.  Build a Subscription Tracking Calendar  The first method is to create a subscription tracking calendar. Using the calendar app on your phone or your computer, create calendar notifications for each of your subscription services. If a subscription is monthly, create a notification each month on the day it is due. In the event name, include the service and the amount. If you don’t have the subscription on auto pay, include a reminder a day or two before to be sure that you pay the bill. If the bill is annual, add a notification for the date each year that it renews. Again, add the amount and set a reminder for yourself so you can take the bill into consideration and adjust your budget. Give your subscription reminders all the same color so you can see at a glance when looking at your calendar when they are due.    This method of tracking subscriptions may seem a bit tedious. But if your subscriptions aren’t automatically billed to a card or account, or you are finding yourself repeatedly with more month than money, this method can help you find areas to tighten your budget. It can also ensure you don’t miss payments.  Create a Subscriptions Spreadsheet  If most of your subscriptions are automatically paid or you don’t want to clutter up your calendar, I recommend building a subscriptions spreadsheet. You can do this in whatever spreadsheet software you regularly use. Key pieces of information to include in your spreadsheet are:  what the subscription is how much it costs the frequency that you are billed for it (monthly, quarterly, annually the payment due date what account the bill is paid from if it is paid automatically the web address for managing your subscription and (optionally) your login information  Update your spreadsheet whenever you sign up for a new subscription so that you have accurate information.  This method allows you to keep more information about your subscriptions and to track your spending over time. This can give you insight into your spending habits and allow you to reflect on your different services and how much use you get out of them.  No matter what method you choose, find one that will work for you and that you can maintain. It’s also important to remember when trial periods end, and you will start paying for a subscription. This will allow you to cancel the service if you don’t find yourself using it. In today’s world, subscription services seem to be a fact of life. Developing a strategy for managing them that works for you and that you can maintain is key! "} 
{"prompt":"Why You Need a Financial GPS","completion":" The last partof my morning routine goes like this:   Get in the car. Open Pandora (the free version, of course). Select the Nelly & St. Lunatics channel.  Open the Waze app. Select location labeled as Work.  Back out of my driveway; I’m on the way!  You might think that it’s silly for me to use a navigation or GPS app to get to work every day. You may be wondering if I even know my way around where I live! A GPS app helps me overcome issues that arise while en route: traffic building up, accidents, flooding, or objects in the road. It alerts me to problems that are arising and suggests a different route if needed. It doesn’t change the location I travel to, but it helps me adapt my path so that I arrive more quickly.  Your budget or your spending plan is your financial GPS .  What’s Your Location?  In your budget, the location you’re traveling toward is your  financial goal . Take the time to soul search and figure out what resonates for you. In my experience as an Accredited Financial Counselor, not having established goals is the biggest mistake I’ve seen when it comes to budgeting. Goals are motivational and exciting. They help keep you on track. Without goals, it’s very difficult to follow your plan because you don’t have anything set that you’re working toward. Without financial goals, it’s like taking a drive with nowhere to go.  You budget to reach the goals that are important to you. You budget so you have less stress, build memories on a family vacation, and spend time with your children when you buy an ice cream cone once a month. Every single one of those goals is important not only to you but to your family. This is what you’re traveling toward in your budget and is the location you arrive at.  What’s Your Route?  The route you travel is the budget or spending plan itself. When traffic is building up, a GPS helps to send you a slightly different path. In other words, your budget adapts to your circumstances. In order to be as effective as possible, these updates need to happen in real time. Your budget is something you need to revisit and revise regularly.  When you’re first building your budget, you want to get as specific as possible to flesh out the details. Make a list of all of the bills you have to pay on a monthly basis. You and I both know that you have many more expenses to cover, so doing this only gets you part of the way there. What else do you pay for?  It’s very difficult to fully understand where your money is going without looking in the past. Look over your bank, credit card, and payment apps (such as CashApp, Venmo, and PayPal) over a set period of time. Since we’re in the month of May right now, I’d suggest looking at April 1 through April 30. Add up your variable expenses within categories — these are the expenses that fluctuate from month to month. Groceries, dining out, gas, and entertainment are some examples of variable expense categories. Repeat for at least one other month, for example, March 1 through 31. Create an average by adding the category totals and dividing by the number of months used in the spending review.   Here’s an example of how you’d figure out your average monthly spending on groceries:  April groceries = $753.20 March groceries = $748.50 February groceries = $588.10 Grocery total for three months = $2,089.80 Average grocery cost (divide total cost by three) = $696.60  Now you need to ask yourself some questions.   Which of these need to stay the same? What categories cause you discomfort when you look at the numbers? Do you want to change those categories? What changes can you reasonably make given your family’s needs and activities? Gas is a difficult variable expense to change in most cases because you need to get to work, drop your children off at daycare, and run other errands essential for your household. Other categories might make sense to change, though. Dining out and entertainment are often categories that can be trimmed back.  What expenses do you cover over the year? Back to school, holidays, birthdays, and property taxes are some of the big ones that come to my mind. It’s wise to prepare over time; think of what your game plan will be in your budget. Some of these may even be the financial goals you’re working toward. Remember, this is the location you’re traveling toward, so allocating some of your income for these goals is key.  Do You Need to Reroute Your Path?  When there’s an unexpected expense or change in income, sometimes our budget has to reroute us just as a GPS would guide us around a traffic build-up. It’s okay if you can’t save the $100 you planned this month because you can use your budget to save $25 extra over the next 4 months to make up for lost ground. The ability to change routes is the great part about using a budget!   You’re still travelingto work, but you might use a different highway. Only now, you’re not stuck inthat traffic jam for an hour; you’re arriving on time. You might adapt a couplemonths of your budget, but you’re still able build a sandcastle at the lakewith your daughter on your family vacation. "} 
{"prompt":"4 Questions to Figure Out How Much Money You Need to Retire","completion":" That is a hard question, which I can only answer with a lot more questions!  Question 1: Timeline  The first question you need to ask yourself is: when do you want to retire? This will help you figure out how much time you have to get where you want to be.  Question 2: Expenses  Second, what will your living expenses be when you retire? Will you be in a high cost of living area? Do you expect you will have paid off your home already? Or will you have a mortgage or rent payment? Figure out the same for your car. And don’t forget food, utilities, gas and car insurance, along with medical insurance and medical bills.  Question 3: Retirement Goals  Next, what are your retirement goals? What is it that you want to do in retirement? Do you see a life of travel or do you want to stay home? Will you want to do some upgrading to your home or start that business that you always wanted to start? You need to factor in all of these expenses in addition to your normal, day-to-day expenses.   Question 4: Income  Determine what you can expect your Social Security income to be. You can do that by going to the  Social Security Administration website  and registering with MySocialSecurity. This will allow you access projections from the Social Security Administration.  Also, will you have a pension from a former employer or are you building your own savings in a 401(k) or IRA, or both? This is where your savings should be. If you haven’t started yet, the sooner you start saving the better.  Your time is worth more than your money  when it comes to retirement savings.   Next Steps for Retirement Planning  This can all be a little (or a lot!) overwhelming. There are experts who can help you run the math on all of this, and they can make projections on the earnings of your savings. This is where time comes into play. The more time you have to save, the harder your money can move you toward your retirement goals.  If it’s within your financial limits, I would recommend a Certified Financial Planner who is Fee Only. They have software that can calculate what you will need in order to get the retirement you want. Certified Financial Planners can be expensive, so shop around and also check with your HR Dept. You might have an employee assistance program that would be discounted. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Prepare for a Family Financially","completion":"Since we know that everything affects everything, let’s talk about how our financial lives are impacted by our families. Over 80% of SaverLife members live with at least one other person—be that a parent, child, partner, or roommate—and even if you are single, you may have heard that having a baby can really break the budget (that may be enough to freak you out!). Every family is unique and every family has different priorities and goals. You may be saving for your kids’ education, your dream wedding, a family vacation, or a safe place for your kids to grow up.  Every change in family structure, whether you are getting married, moving in with a partner, or having children—is a big financial decision that involves navigating a complicated financial landscape. Here are some ideas for icebreakers to start important conversations about family changes.  Getting Married  If you’re preparing for a new marriage or partnership, here are some questions I think you should spend some time answering for yourself, and also discussing candidly with your partner:   What is your current financial situation?  How do you live with money now?  What is your money “profile”? Are you a saver or a spender?  What financial expectations do you have for your partner? These could be expectations about the decisions they’ll make or their financial behaviors.  How will you handle  differences in money habits and attitudes ?  How will you determine individual and shared financial priorities?   If you’re able to talk honestly about these issues and feel confident that you’re on the same page with your partner, that’s a really good place to start your financial journey together.  Your Growing Family  Likewise, having or adopting a child will impact all aspects of your financial life and brings its own sets of challenges and rewards. Here are some more questions that you should spend time answering:   What are your core values about money and family?  What adjustments are you willing to make to accommodate this change?  How will you address unexpected health issues, special needs, job changes, and income fluctuations?   In addition to these big-picture questions, there are also some logistical issues that you need to sort out, including:   Medical expenses: What is covered by your insurance? What are the gaps?  Cash flow: What will change?  Insurance: What must change?  Taxes (BONUS!): Your cute little tax deduction!  Estate planning and guardianship arrangements: Who will take care of your little one if you can’t?  Long-term savings: What do you hope to provide for your child for college? (And what are your own expectations for retirement?)   With a baby, there are both one-time expenses and ongoing expenses. How will you address both? A cool resource from  BabyCenter  can help you come up with a rough estimate of first-year baby costs.  Of course it’s not possible to think about everything, but you can plan for changes you are anticipating (even if they are far off into the future) by taking a few steps to build your financial security.

{"prompt":"What Will Hurt Your Credit Score?","completion":"    When you are working hard to build your credit score, it’s important to do things that will help your score go up. But it’s equally important to understand what will hurt your score. When you understand what can hurt your credit score, you can change your behavior and take steps to avoid certain actions so that your score continues to grow. Here are four things that can hurt your credit score. Keep these in mind as you manage your money.  1. Paying Late or Missing Payments  Your payment history makes up 35% of your FICO credit score. Making your payments late or missing payments altogether will hurt your credit score. This factor is the largest single portion of your credit score, so each payment you make or miss can have a big impact. Missing your payments also signals to lenders that you are a risky borrower and might have more debt than you can manage.  To avoid missing and late payments that drag down your score, be sure to only put charges on your credit card that you can pay off. Also, do not borrow money unless you can make the payments. If something happens and you are unable to make a payment on time, reach out to your lender or creditor. They may be able to adjust your due date so you can pay on time and maintain your credit score.  2. Using Too Much of Your Credit  Your credit usage accounts for 30% of your FICO score and using too much of your available credit can hurt your score. Creditors look at your credit utilization ratio, or how much of your credit that you are using compared to how much credit you have, to determine if you are a risky borrower. Ideally, creditors want to see you use less than 30% of your available credit.  To keep your credit usage from negatively impacting your credit score, aim to use less than 30% of your available credit. So, if you have two credit cards, each with a $500 limit, you have a total available credit of $1,000. Do your best to keep your total usage below $300 to keep your credit usage from hurting your credit score.  3. Opening Too Many New Accounts  Another thing that can lower your credit score is opening too many new accounts in a short period of time. New accounts make up 10% of your FICO credit score. Opening too many accounts at once causes lenders to worry that you may be taking on too much debt and causes your score to drop.  Instead of opening several accounts all at once, just open new accounts when you actually need them. And be sure that you have a plan in place to make your payments. This will help keep your credit score higher.  4. Closing Credit Cards  While it may seem counterintuitive, closing credit card accounts can actually hurt your credit score. Fifteen percent of your FICO credit score comes from your length of credit history. If you close your older credit cards because you aren’t using them anymore, this actually shortens the length of your credit history, and hurts your score. Closing a credit card also decreases your available credit, which can in turn increase the percentage of your total credit you use.  Remember, you want to keep your credit usage under 30%, so closing a card can hurt your credit score in this area as well.  Instead of closing a credit card, just don’t use it. You can put it in a drawer or another safe place and hold on to it. This will keep your credit history length intact and also will not increase your credit utilization ratio. This will help keep your credit score up.  Managing Your Credit Score  It’s important to understand what can hurt your credit score and how you can protect yourself. By paying your bills on time, managing how much credit you use and how many accounts you open, and by keeping your cards open even if you don’t use them, you will be well on your way to building good credit. Credit is a great tool to have on your personal finance journey. And using your credit responsibly can help you as you work towards your financial goals.

{"prompt":"How Distinguishing Between Needs and Wants Can Help You Build a Better Budget","completion":" In order to create a budget that not only works, but that you can thrive on, it helps to consider your needs and wants. It can be hard initially to see any of your spending as a want because you can’t see your life without it. But if you take a step back and evaluate your needs and wants, you will find ways to budget better. This will have a positive impact on your financial life as a whole.  What is a Need?  A need is a good or service that you must have in order to survive. The number of needs a person has is limited. For the most part, needs are consistent from person to person. This category includes shelter, clothing, food, gas and electricity, transportation, and healthcare.  What is a Want?  A want is something that you desire to make your life better or more fulfilled, but doesn’t impact your immediate survival.  Wants can include eating out, entertainment, travel, gym memberships, designer clothing, and anything else that you would like in your life. Unlike needs, which cover a more limited range of expenses, wants are limitless and vary greatly from person to person.  It’s important to remember that some basic expenses are a need but can also become wants depending on circumstances. Transportation, for example, is a need at the basic level. You need a subway pass or a car to get to work, get groceries, and take your kids to school. You don’t, however, need to go all of these places in a luxury car. That is a want.  Dividing Your Expenses  Now that you understand the difference, divide up your expenses as either needs or wants. To do this, look at all of your monthly spending and give each expense the category of need or want. Remember that you may need your cell phone to communicate, so it can be labeled a need. But no matter how much you feel like you can’t live without it, your streaming service is probably a want.   If you aren’t sure if an expense is a need or a want, it can help to think about it from a slightly different perspective. You can apply the MoSCoW model, which stands for Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have, to the expense. If the expense is a Must have, it is a need. If it is a Should have or a Could have, it is a want. But if it is a Won’t have, then you can cut it from your budget. As you work on your budget, you can prioritize the Should have spending over the Could have spending to incorporate your values into your budget.   Building Your Budget   Knowing the difference between your wants and your needs can help you develop a budget you can actually stick to. To start, define your income. This will let you know how much you can spend and save in a given month.  Next, budget for all your needs. Start by subtracting your necessary monthly spending from your income. Once all of your needs are accounted for, you can start adding your wants into your budget. Include your high-value wants into your budget first. This will allow you to cover the expenses on the things you really value before worrying about the things that aren’t as important.  A Few Things to Remember  Needs and wants can change over time as your circumstances change, so be flexible and consider your budget often.  Remember to factor debt repayment into your budget. It may not feel like a need, but to keep your credit score up, stay out of collections, and pay less interest over time, those payments still need to be made. Saving is also not necessarily a need or want, but something you should factor into your budget.   If you make sure that your needs are taken care of first, you will be able to use what is leftover to cover some of your wants. This will help you create a sustainable budget, move your personal finances forward, and reach your personal finance goals. "} 
{"prompt":"Grab a Friend! Social Strategies to Help You Save","completion":" There is strength in numbers! This is especially true when you’re trying to reach your goals and change behaviors. Weight Watchers uses this principle to support healthy eating, and Alcoholics Anonymous uses it to encourage sober living. Emerging research shows that peer support can increase your confidence and sense of control. Social support also makes you more likely to succeed in changing your habits. By participating in social savings strategies, you can capture these same benefits with your financial goals and savings habits.  Socializing your financial goals and savings strategies is when you get together with people to support each other and fulfill your aspirations. These peer support groups can be loose and informal with your friends to help each other save. They can also be formal and structured with agreed-upon savings amounts. Social strategies can include technology, but they don’t need to.  Let’s explore some options for getting social with your financial goals and savings strategies. These strategies can help you save more by providing mutual accountability, shared support, and peer learning.  Vision board party  A vision board is a collage of visual images or words that represent your financial goals or dreams. You can make one by hand using magazine cutouts, photos, or stickers on a poster board. You can make one digitally through a website like Pinterest. Creating a financial vision board with your friends can be fun. But it’s also a tangible way to see and support each others’ goals and plan how to achieve them.  Savings Club  Social savings clubs are small groups of people with similar savings goals who commit to gathering together and regularly saving a specific amount for a period of time.  For example, if members of your group are saving $600 for an emergency savings fund over six months, each individual commits to save $100 by each monthly meeting. Alternatively, your group could commit to doing something like the 52-week money challenge where you gradually increase your savings by a dollar a week over a whole year.  Lending Circle  Lending circles are when a small group of friends or family saves together and lends each other money. The group agrees on a monthly amount that each member contributes. Each month, a new member of the lending circle receives the “loan” until everyone in the group gets paid.  If a lending circle has 10 members who contribute $100 each month, each member receives $1,000 over 10 months.  Financial Support Group  In a financial support group, members provide each other with emotional support. They share information and personal experiences related to financial goals, saving habits, and relationships with money. Peer-led financial circles are collaborative and creative experiences that can increase self-awareness and self-confidence, and in turn your financial health.  Socially-Networked Savings Account  Online savings accounts like  SmartyPig  allow you to announce your financial goals to the world, network with other savers, and ask for help from friends and family.  –  The idea behind social saving is that the more support you get, the more successful you will be in reaching your financial goals. You can mix and match these options or get creative with other possibilities. Many studies (as well as my own personal experiences) show that you’re more likely to complete a goal if someone is holding you accountable for it and providing you with emotional and practical support. Saving can be more fun and meaningful when you involve your friends and family on your financial journey! "} 
{"prompt":"Should I use money in a mutual fund to fix my basement?","completion":"“I have some money in a mutual account that I transferred from an IRA account. I want to use some of this money to fix my basement. Should I?”  Submitted by Pauline B.  I’m going to have to make a few assumptions here to respond to your question.  It seems you transferred funds from an IRA into a mutual fund (taxable) account. To do this, you may have faced tax consequences if you weren’t at least 59½ years old (the penalty-free withdrawal age). If your mutual fund is not an IRA or other tax-advantaged account, the only decision you need to make is whether basement renovation is your financial priority.  There is no “right” answer about what you should or should not do with your money. The real question is, what is your overall plan for your resources? What impact will using the money have and what would happen if you don’t fix the basement? When my coaching clients are faced with a decision I ask them to do the following:   Write the pros and cons of the idea/change (in your case, fixing the basement).  Write the pros and cons of doing nothing (in your case, keeping the money in your account).   If your cash flow is good and you don’t have other financial concerns, which of the options is more satisfying for you? Once you make that decision, establish a budget for the repairs and decide how much you want to keep in the mutual fund. "}

{"prompt":"Are there debt consolidation companies for poor credit scores?","completion":" Submitted by Sara K.  A Debt Management Plan (DMP) that is offered by a non-profit credit counseling agency can be an excellent tool for getting out of debt. Anyone can use these plans, whether they have poor credit or great credit. Credit cards, collections, and medical debt are eligible for these programs.  How a Debt Management Plan works  Every month, you make a payment to the agency, and then the agency in turn sends a payment to each of your creditors. That means that every 30 days, the creditor is getting a payment.  Because you are working with a DMP and not going to a debt settlement company or filing for bankruptcy, your creditors are motivated to work with you. Often, they will either lower the monthly payment they are requesting, lower the interest rate, or both! Each creditor tells the plan what they are willing to do.  You are paying back the full amount of principal, but with a lowered interest rate. That makes it easier to tackle this debt much more quickly. By law, each credit card must be paid in full in 60 months.  How a Debt Management Plan can affect your credit  The DMP does not report to the three major credit bureaus. However,  because the debt remains with your creditors, they continue to report the payment every 30 days. This can build your credit history.    If you are already behind when you come into the plan, some of the creditors will even age up the account once they have received two to four payments. This is basically a fresh start, as they will no longer report you as late. If the card isn’t eligible for a re-age, you are encouraged to slowly make up the past due amount by paying a little extra each month. The late fees stop when your credit card is enrolled in the program, so paying $10-$20 month will make a difference.   Your credit cards will be closed when they go into the plan. You might see a small dip in your credit score because of this. But because you are continuing to make a monthly payment you can afford, you are building a great credit history. And because the interest rate is lower and you’re paying back so much more of the amount you borrowed, your credit score will most likely rebound and improve. Payment history and amount owed make up 65% of the calculation for your credit score. A DMP helps in both of these areas.  How much does a Debt Management Plan cost?  There is a small fee associated with plan. The state you live in will determine that fee. These plans are administered by non-profit agencies, but they do have to keep the lights on! The savings of interest on the credit cards will likely cover the cost. Plus, the counselor you work with will be able to disclose this information to you before you enter the program.  If you’re interested, find a  non-profit Debt Management Plan administrator in your area .    "}

{"prompt":"I want to buy a house, but my credit isn’t good. What can I do?","completion":" I want to buy a house, but I have bad credit. Should I file bankruptcy? What should I do?  Submitted by Marcella S.  Buying a home is many people’s idea of achieving the American Dream. But the road to homeownership can be stressful, confusing, and overwhelming. When I purchased my first home, I had no idea about the home buying process. I experienced all three feelings as I went through the process for the first time. Being prepared to purchase a home is particularly beneficial when buying a house for the first time.   Get Mortgage Ready  You must first become mortgage ready to purchase a home. Three primary steps convey mortgage readiness to a financial institution. One, all lenders review the borrower’s credit history and credit scores from all three credit bureaus and choose the middle rating. This is known as a tri-merge. It’s a good idea for you to  pull all three credit reports  for free ahead of time. This way you know what aspects of your credit report needs correcting. Second, they analyze your capacity to repay the loan by looking at your debt to income ratio. Third, there is a review of the collateral value (the house) you are buying to determine what it’s worth.  Each financial institution sets its criteria for qualified credit history and credit scores, debt ratios, and collateral values. So you may need to shop around with a few lenders before you find one that will work with you.   Options for Low Credit  If you don’t have good credit, you may be required to have additional funding and an alternative form of credit like the following:  Larger Down Payment : A down payment reduces the risk for the lender. You have skin in the game. They have a buffer. Cash Reserves : Even with a sizable down payment, it’s helpful to have ample cash reserves on hand. Rent History : Be able to verify that you’ve paid your rent-on time consistently for 12 to 24 months.    Is bankruptcy a good option?  If you file bankruptcy, that will only make your credit worse. So that’s probably not a good idea if you want to achieve your objective of purchasing a home in the near future.  I wish you the best in your homeownership pursuit! "} 
{"prompt":"What is the Health Insurance Marketplace?","completion":" The Health Insurance Marketplace is an online system run by each state that lets people compare options and shop to  find an affordable health insurance plan  that works for them.   Through the online Health Insurance Marketplace, you can look to see what options are available if you want to purchase insurance. With the Health Insurance Marketplace, you can compare plans and their costs in terms of premiums, deductibles, and how much you can expect to pay out-of-pocket. You’ll also be able to find out if you qualify for any form of public health insurance. Depending on your income level, you might qualify for Medicaid. Any dependent children in your household might qualify for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). If you are over the age of 65, you can find out about your Medicare options.  By shopping the Health Insurance Marketplace, you’ll also find out if you qualify for two kinds of savings:  Advanced premium tax credits, which bring down your monthly health insurance premiums. Cost sharing reductions, which lower your out of pocket costs, like deductibles and copays. If you qualify for a cost sharing reduction, you can only use it if you enroll in a Silver plan.   Nearly 9 out of 10 people who enroll in a Marketplace plan qualify for at least one kind of savings. New data shows that in 2020, at least  one third of people can find a plan for less than $10/month .   After you’ve done your research and compared plans, you can enroll in your new health insurance plan online through the Health Insurance Marketplace. "} 
{"prompt":"6 Steps to Become Debt-Free","completion":" Think of a goal that you’ve set for yourself. Maybe there’s a book that you want to finish, you want to start exercising three days per week, or you want to take the first step in changing careers. Those are all great goals, and there is one more that I want to put on your radar.  I want to talk about a practical goal that many people work towards every day: Living debt-free. For some people, this goal might seem more daunting than the others. For other people, living debt-free is a boring or tiresome goal. The truth is, it’s one of the most important goals you can have, and one that is very possible to reach.  The first thing we need to do to get out of debt is to understand what debt is. Simply put by Oxford Languages: debt is “the state of owing money.” Owing money on a car, student loans, credit cards, etc. puts you in debt. It may sound scary, but remember, it is possible to get out of debt and live debt-free. Just like with any goal, getting out of debt and staying out of debt takes work and commitment. Here are some suggestions that you can use to reach your debt-free goal.  1. Determine how much you owe  Add up all of your debt. Then decide how much you can pay toward your debt each month. You can determine how long it will take to pay off your debt by dividing how much you owe by how much you will pay each month. If you owe $1,000 and you pay $100 toward that debt each month, it will take about 10 months to pay off your debt. ($1,000/$100 = 10 months)  2. Determine your cash flow  It is important to know how much money is coming in as well how much is going out. Once you know where your money is going, you can adjust your cash flow to minimize extra costs so that you can put more money toward your debt.  3. Create a spending plan  A spending plan helps to keep you on track as you work toward your goal of living debt-free. It prioritizes  needs and wants , and it helps make your cash flow more predictable.  4. Save for emergencies  Sometimes the unexpected happens, and sometimes the unexpected is unexpectedly expensive. It helps to have a safety net, just in case. This is another area where a spending plan and adjusting your cash flow comes in handy. In addition to paying off your debt, set aside at least 10% of your income in a savings account. This may not be possible right away, but it is important to start by setting aside as much as you can to help with emergencies.  5. Find a financial coach  It is much easier to reach a goal if you have an accountability partner to help you! A financial coach will help you with these steps and more so that you don’t have to go it alone.  6. Be patient  It took a while to accumulate debt, so it will take a while to get out of it. Just keep working toward your goal and you can reach it!  Working toward living debt-free can seem like daunting goal, but it is attainable and important. With hard work and commitment, you can live debt-free! "}

{"prompt":"Do I need to file a tax return if my only income is Social Security?","completion":" Submitted by anonymous.  That’s a great question, as many Americans’ only source of income is Social Security. Social Security income is taxed for federal and state income tax purposes. If your earned income exceeds IRS 2019 filing guidelines, you are required to file a tax return with the IRS and in most states.  Do I need to file a state tax return?  State income tax is limited to earned income in some states, like North Dakota, where state income tax rate is 1.1%. Some states exempt earned income altogether. These include Alaska, Wyoming, Washington, South Dakota, Florida, Nevada, and Texas (as well as Tennessee, which only taxes interest).  Do I need to file a federal tax return?  Under 2019 IRS filing guidelines, the minimum income amount at which you need to file depends on two main factors. The two factors are status and age. Status means whether you are filing as single, married, head of household, or married filing separate. If you are under age 65, are single, and have Social Security income below $12,200, you generally don’t have to file a federal tax return. If you are older than 65, the amount goes up to $13,850 before you must file a federal tax return.  Hopefully, this answer is what you need to know about filing taxes with just Social Security income.  "} 
{"prompt":"When Should I Start Investing?","completion":" You may have heard the Chinese proverb: the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now. The same is true with investing. If you think you’ll have time to get started later, you should see  how that’s working out for older generations .  The Power of Compound Interest  If you wait to invest, you miss out on a huge advantage – compound interest. An urban legend says that Einstein once called this the most powerful force in the universe.  Compound interest means the money you invest earns interest, and your interest earns more interest. This allows the growth of your money to accelerate with time. If you start early, you will give your invested dollars a better opportunity to build on each other. The following example shows the true power of this:  Amber saves and invests $5,000 a year between the ages of 25 and 35, and then she stops saving. Jeff does not start saving until age 35. He then saves and invests $5,000 a year for the next 30 years.  Amber has saved a total of $50,000 (10 times $5,000) and Jeff has saved a total of $150,000 (30 times $5,000). They both earn an average of 10% a year on their investments ( average historical return of stock market ).  Who do you think has more money at age 65?  Amazingly it is Amber! She has a little under $1.4 million. Jeff ends up with $822,000, 41% less than Amber, even though he saved three times more of his money. This is because he started 10 years later. This is why it makes sense to start investing sooner rather than later. You can play with the numbers yourself using a  compound return calculator .  Should I Pay Off My Debt First?  This question comes up often. I usually recommend setting aside some income to invest while paying off debt. Even if the interest rate on your debt is higher than the expected return on your investments, it is psychologically important to see your wealth grow as your debt goes down. Otherwise, it can be tough to stick to your debt reduction plan. For instance, you can set aside 10% of your income for debt repayment and 10% for investing. Once your debt is paid off, you can double your investment contributions. No amount is too small – even  $50 per month  can go a long way.   Check out more articles on  paying off debt .

{"prompt":"What is a Sinking Fund?","completion":" A sinking fund is a way for corporations to put aside money at specific intervals in order to pay a bond or a debt that will be due at a later date.  You can use this same strategy to achieve your goals or pay for expenses that aren’t due on a monthly basis. By planning and putting away a little bit each paycheck, big expenses can be less of a burden.    Let’s say you pay your car insurance every six months, and that bill is $600 each time. Based on when the bill is due, you can figure out how long you have to save the full amount. For our example, let’s say you have six months.    To calculate how much to save, take the total due and divide it by the number of months you have. In our example it’s $600 divided by 6 which equals $100 per month. You would put your “sinking fund” requirement right on your monthly budget for $100. Or if you’re paid twice a month, you can even break it down further to $50 per paycheck.  I suggest moving the money for your sinking fund out of your checking account and into a savings account. Out of sight and out of mind! This can prevent you from spending the money on other things. Then, when the bill arrives, simply transfer the money back into your checking account and pay the bill.  The next month, start adding back to the sinking fund for the next time your insurance is due. "} 
{"prompt":"How To Talk about Finances with Your Children","completion":" It’s important to talk openly with your family about your financial goals, values, and situation on a regular basis. However, that’s easier said than done. As early as preschool, you can start talking to children about money and building their financial skills in age-appropriate ways. For preschoolers, you might focus on the skill of waiting (delayed gratification) or counting. For high schoolers, you might discuss healthy habits and help them open a bank account.  When you work together as a family to set financial priorities and follow a plan, you’re more likely to stick to it. Collaborative planning helps everyone make day-to-day financial choices that are in line with your goals, values, and financial reality.  If you don’t already talk about your finances as a family, there is no time like the present to start. Whether money is tight or not, here are some tips to consider:  Start with Goals, Values, and Essentials.  To help you make financial decisions, what is vital to the family? What does your family need to survive and thrive? Gather your family and talk about what is important to you collectively. Try to agree on the top priorities that you all intend to focus on together.   Establish a Schedule to Talk about Your Finances as a Family.  Think about how often you want and are able to check in. Weekly, monthly, or some other interval? Use these meetings to check in on how things are going and troubleshoot any issues.  When Changes Arise, Meet as Soon as Possible.  Such changes could include an economic recession, job loss, or a health situation. Be proactive and transparent about what this means for your financial situation to help your family manage their expectations.  Practice Clear Communication.  Practice communicating your financial concerns ahead of time. That way, you can deliver them calmly and clearly. This will increase the chances that your family will hear them and respond in ways that address the concern. Talking about financial challenges can be emotional and create conflict.  It’s no guarantee, but practice will help you deliver your message in ways that bring people in to resolve the situation.  Work Together to Make Tough Decisions.  When money is tight, it can be hard to balance the essentials and what everyone wants. If you’re struggling to make ends meet or want to build up your emergency fund to weather a recession, your family decisions become about trade-offs in priorities and trying to spend less than what you are bringing in.

{"prompt":"Keep It in the Family: How to Pass on Money and Assets to Family Members","completion":" Creating a plan for how you will pass on money or other assets (anything you own) is called  estate planning . Many people think that if they don’t have a lot of money or assets (like homes, cars, and jewelry), they don’t have an “estate.” But the fact is we all have an estate.  How you transfer your estate to the next generation is often referred to as a financial legacy. This legacy is the foundation for building inter-generational wealth.   The Emotional Side of Estate Planning  Transferring wealth is practical, but it is also an emotional process.  You have to consider something that most people don’t like to think about – what will happen to your family or heirs when you are no longer here. It can be sad to think about that reality, but the real question at stake is how we prepare ourselves and our families to continue to build on the financial wealth you have created.  Kathleen Burns Kingsbury, a wealth expert, suggests  the following questions  to ask yourself as you are preparing your estate:  What lessons did you learn from your parents about money and finance that you would like to pass onto your heirs? What family values would you like to pass down to the next generation and how do you plan on communicating this family legacy? What concerns do you have about your adult children when it comes to inheriting and managing the family wealth?  Simple Will or Trust?  There’s no right answer for everyone for whether a simple will or trust is better. It all depends on your circumstances. I recommend that you start by  learning about your options . (Note that this site sells products and services. I am not recommending that you buy anything there; it’s just a good place to compare your options.)  Once you decide what you need, consider the most appropriate way to get the service, including pro bono financial planners, nonprofit agencies, or paid financial or legal experts (usually an attorney for estate planning).  Beneficiary Designations  You should designate someone as your beneficiary for all of your accounts, including your employer retirement accounts as well as your checking and savings accounts. Make sure you keep these designations up to date if you have life changes (like if you move, marry, divorce, or have children). Do you  really  want your ex to get all of your stuff?  On a bank account, this is sometimes called a TOD (transfer on death) instead of beneficiary designation. It means that your beneficiary will be able to access the account without the intervention of a court or  probate .  If you have children under the age of 18, you should have at minimum a simple will with guardianship arrangements (need to do this? Go ahead…I’ll wait). The guardian may be the person you designate for the accounts if you are leaving funds for them to care for your dependents.  If you have insurance policies, keep good, updated records about the policies, the beneficiary, and the claim forms.  Record-Keeping  Keep all your records in one place and make a list (written and digital) of all of the above. Let your beneficiary know where that document is so that it’s easy to find.  What to Do Now  I know this all might sound like a lot to do. Well, it is! Estate planning is a big, important topic and I encourage you to learn more before making decisions.   But there are a few things that I encourage you to do as soon as possible:  Guardianship : If you have minor children, make sure you’ve arranged guardianship for them. Decide now who you want to care for your dependents and talk to them. Get a document establishing this in place even if you still need to work on other issues. Records : List your accounts! Know and list every bank, investment, retirement, employer retirement, and insurance account.  Don’t let perfection get in the way of progress. Gather all your documents and communicate your wishes to the person who will be in charge of executing your plan.  This is a great time to think about what is most important to you. Then take steps to make sure that everything you have worked hard for will be passed along according to your wishes! "} 
{"prompt":"I just paid off a house that I got on land contract. How do I add it to my credit report?","completion":" Submitted by Renee K.  This is a great question. Before your question, no one has ever asked me about this, so thank you for letting me get this info out!  What’s a land contract?  A land contract is an agreement between a buyer and seller. The buyer purchases property directly from the seller without the involvement of a bank.  Benefits of a land contract  For some people, a land contract is a great option for purchasing a home if they can’t get a traditional mortgage. It can let you buy a home while showing on your credit report that you don’t have as much debt in comparison to your income. This is called debt-to-income ratio.  Drawbacks of a land contract  On the flip side is the reality that the payments you make go directly to the seller instead of a bank. This means your payments may not be reported to the credit bureaus. You may miss out on the benefit of building an on-time payment history with the payments you make. You might think that as long as you have a record of your payments and the seller agrees with you, then you can report this payment history to the credit bureaus yourself. Unfortunately, that’s not the case.  Getting your payments reported to the credit bureaus  You are not able to report the payments to the credit bureaus. Only the creditors can report. That means you’re at the mercy of the seller in this situation. You can ask the seller to report your payment history to the credit reporting agencies. That would allow the payments to be added to your credit report.   But, more often than not, individuals who act as creditors in a land contract arrangement do not report payment history because they have to pay a fee to register with the reporting agencies and report payments. Consider negotiating with the seller. It may be to your benefit to offer to pay the fee if they are unwilling to do so.  Even if your credit report doesn’t show the payments, be proud of yourself for taking on the challenge of paying for your home and making all the payments so that you own it outright.

However, it’s not uncommon for a credit report to contain mistakes. For example, your credit report may show an unpaid medical bill for services that were paid by the insurance company. It may show a student loan with monthly payments even if you paid off that loan last year. Your credit report might have an account on there that is not even yours.  These are mistakes that you can correct. In fact, you have the right to get mistakes corrected at no charge. Left uncorrected, mistakes could hurt your chances of reaching other financial goals. So, what do you do?  Order your credit reports  Your first step is to order and review your credit report from all three of the major credit reporting agencies (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to see which of your credit reports has mistakes. Because they are three separate companies, each credit reporting agency can have slightly different information. You can order free copies of your credit report from all three agencies at Annual Credit Report  online  or by calling 1-877-322-8228. You also can order copies directly from the three agencies. Under Federal law, you are entitled to receive one free copy of your credit report from each credit reporting agency every 12 months.  Follow instructions provided  If you discover an error on your credit report, follow the instructions provided with your credit report on how to correct errors. You can report errors to any of the credit reporting agencies by:  calling the credit agency using the dispute portal when you get your credit report sending a written letter, including documentation, to the appropriate agency  Provide documentation  Send any additional information that is needed to correct the error. The credit reporting agency will tell you what you need to send. Get in the habit of keeping your financial records in order so it’s easy to show where a mistake has occurred.  In the medical example above, call the medical provider to confirm that the insurance company paid the bill. Ask the hospital to send a letter of explanation to the credit reporting agency. To correct the student loan problem, send the credit reporting agency a copy of the document proving the loan was paid with a letter asking for a change in your record.  If an account is not yours, first contact the creditor listed on the credit report. Request more information about the account to help you determine whether the account belongs to you, is the result of identity theft, or was simply reported in error. You can dispute the information if you determine the account does not belong to you.  If you think it’s fraudulent, include in your explanation that you believe the account may be related to identity theft. You can dispute the account as fraud and ask the credit agency to add a security alert to your credit report. That alert will notify creditors that your information may have been compromised.  Explain the issue  Explain the problem in a brief letter. The agency must investigate your complaint within 30-45 days and get back to you with its results. As part of the investigation, the credit reporting agency will check with the creditor whose information you are questioning. If the agency finds that the information in the credit report is incorrect, the creditor must notify the other major credit reporting agencies of the error so they can update their information.   Contact a credit if unresolved  Contact the creditor directly if the credit reporting agency disputes the error and you still believe your credit report is inaccurate. When you resolve the dispute, ask the creditor to send a correction to the credit reporting agency.   If still unresolved, tell your side of the story  Write a consumer statement of your side of the story if the issue remains unresolved.  You may write up to 100 words to explain the situation. Employees of the credit reporting agency are often available to help you write your statement. Your statement will appear on your credit report moving forward.

{"prompt":"Your Guide to Marketplace Health Coverage","completion":" Obamacare, ACA, the Affordable Care Act, HealthCare.gov, the Marketplace, healthcare exchanges. Just deciphering the language can be confusing, and that’s before you even try to sign-up for health insurance! Then you need to determine what kind of coverage you’re eligible for, what it will cost, and which plan is best for you.   It can seem like there is a lot to learn. But the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is a federal law with a fairly straightforward set of provisions that changed the American healthcare system. It guarantees more people more access to better quality healthcare at lower costs and with more consumer protections.

{"prompt":"Is 58 too late to try to buy a home?","completion":" Submitted by Darlene D.  For many people, homeownership is an essential part of achieving the American Dream. I applaud you for pursuing your home ownership goals.   In my professional opinion, it’s never too late to buy a home as long as you can afford the mortgage. With modern health advances, people live much longer. So even at the age of 58, having a 15 or sometimes 30 year mortgage is not out of the question for many people. Also, owning a home has many advantages that add value to your financial and personal life.  By owning a home you build equity through appreciation, meaning your house may increase in value over time. At the same, homeowners get important tax breaks. The U.S. Tax Code lets you deduct the interest you pay on your mortgage, your property taxes, as well as some of the costs involved in buying your home. In addition, building equity in your home is a ready-made savings plan. And when you sell, you can generally take up to $250,00 ($500,000 for a married couple) as gain without owing any federal income tax.   On a personal level, owning a home is a great source of pride for many people. It’s tangible proof that you too can own a slice of the American Dream. If you are serious about buying a home, you may want to find a HUD-approved housing counseling agency to assist you with homeownership education and financing information. Happy house hunting! "} 
{"prompt":"How can I get a loan for a cheap used car?","completion":"Hello, Saundra! How do I go about finding and choosing a certain type of loan (if one exists) that would enable me to quickly buy a cheap used car (around a couple thousand) that I could be able to pay back (with no job/income) with only the money I have saved from last semester’s student loan refund and the following ones I’ll be receiving each semester for next few years? I’ve tried searching for too long now to find a vehicle for $1,000 or under, but I’ve been unsuccessful. It’s too difficult and I think it will be easier with a couple more thousand. Thank you in advance!  Submitted by Joan H.  First, congrats on saving that student loan refund! You are absolutely right that you will have more choices for a reliable car if you have additional cash. The question is, what price (the cost of money) will you pay for that cash?  My favorite choice for loans is the local credit union. When I was a (very broke) student I opened a savings account at a local credit union. For more than 10 years, I only had $10 in that account. They never cancelled the account even though I wasn’t a profitable (fee paying) customer. Fast forward 20 years, they now hold my mortgage and they are my first choice for all loans.  So, where do you begin? If you don’t have a banking relationship, consider opening an account with a credit union in your community. There are also online options, so you have many options. The interest rate on car loans is based on your credit score so check your credit reports before you apply so you know what to expect. If you need help with this step, contact a  reputable credit counseling agency .  You may have noticed that I did  not  recommend one of those auto dealers that offers credit at their store. That is a “buyer beware” situation as the cost of credit (fees and interest) is usually very high. They often bait you with a low payment to distract from the high interest rate and total cost of the car.  Bottom line: A credit union or bank will be your best option for an auto loan. Try to secure funding before you shop to help you stay within your budget. Check out this  credit union website  for info on how to prepare for a purchase. Good luck and drive safely!

{"prompt":"How much should I save if I’m in debt?","completion":" How much should I save monthly if I am in debt? Or what percentage of my income should I save if I am in debt?  Submitted by LaTisha V.  When we have debt, our priorities can change completely.  To start, we have to remember that not paying our debt will negatively impact our credit history and therefore take away other opportunities in the future.  In your situation, your income not only needs to cover your basic needs, but also your monthly debt payments. This means your savings capability will be reduced. However, this does  not  mean that it totally disappears. Saving is (almost always) possible.  Let’s start with the fact that there is no such thing as an ideal distribution of our income. Our needs are subjective and therefore we cannot answer this question with a mathematical formula. We all earn different amounts, we have different consumption habits, and our preferences change all the time. Even though experts recommend that we should aim to save 10% of our monthly income, you need to adapt this rule to your lifestyle. If you can do more, that’s great! On the other hand, if you can only save a few dollars a month, that is also great!  Anything you can save is better than nothing.  You can always start with something small and grow from there. Saving is more about consistency than quantity. Get in the habit and the numbers will follow. And if you have debt and your savings capability is diminished, it’s good to remember that the money you use to pay your debt can eventually be reallocated to savings once your debt is repaid.  So, how do you see your panorama now? Are your savings goals realistic? Or do you have to change them? How much can you start saving today?  Everyone must find their own financial balance. "} 
{"prompt":"Do I Qualify for Teacher Loan Forgiveness?","completion":" If you are a teacher or work for an educational service and also have federal student loans, you may qualify for Teacher Loan Forgiveness.  Requirements for Teacher Loan Forgiveness Eligibility  To qualify for Teacher Loan Forgiveness, you must have direct loans or FFEL Program loans borrowed after Oct. 1, 1998. You also need to be employed full-time for five complete and consecutive years as a highly qualified teacher. Additionally, the school where you teach must be an elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency. It must serve low-income students. See a  full directory of schools and agencies  that qualify under this program.  What is a Highly Qualified Teacher?  You must be a highly qualified teacher to be eligible for Teacher Loan Forgiveness. Highly qualified teachers have a bachelor’s degree and are fully certified to teach in their state. If you received a temporary, emergency, or provisional license, the time that you teach with that license does not qualify.  How Much Loan Forgiveness Do I Qualify For?  You can qualify for different amounts of loan forgiveness depending on what subjects you teach. All teachers can receive up to $5,000 in forgiveness. But you can qualify for up to $17,500 if you teach math or science at the secondary level or if you teach special education at the elementary or secondary level.  How to Apply for Teacher Loan Forgiveness  After five consecutive years of teaching, fill out the  Teacher Loan Forgiveness Application  and submit it to your loan servicer. If you have multiple federal loan servicers, submit a form to each of them.  You can qualify for both Teacher Loan Forgiveness and  Public Service Loan Forgiveness , just not during the same time period. This means that after you complete five consecutive years of teaching for Teacher Loan Forgiveness, you would complete an additional ten years (120 payments) for Public Service Loan Forgiveness "} 
{"prompt":"How to Find the Right Products for You","completion":" Hi, I’m Saundra Davis, financial coach here at SaverLife. Today we’re going to talk about how to find the right financial products and services for your situation.  It is wonderful that we have so many financial products and services to choose from, but it can also be overwhelming. It can be very difficult to make a decision. There are many things that you can choose.  Evaluate Your Needs  The first step you want to consider is: what do you need? What problem are you trying to solve? Or what goal are you trying to reach? Once you know that, you can start to determine what’s going to work best for you.  If someone recommends something and you try it and it doesn’t quite get you what you want, it’s fine to stop it and try something new.  Find a Trusted Source  Keep these things in mind: For financial services, you want to make sure that you’re using a trusted advisor. We call that a fiduciary. A fiduciary puts your interests ahead of their own.  We are all going to have to use financial products to achieve our financial plan. You just want to make sure that any recommendations you get are what’s right for you, and not based on what is the best commission structure for the person who’s selling the product.  Using Financial Apps  When it comes to financial apps, you want to make sure that the app can help you achieve your goal at a cost that you’re willing to pay.  Many apps are free, and that’s fine. Just pay attention to if that changes. There are many apps that start out free, and then begin to charge a fee. You may be willing to pay the fee. It may be worth it. The key here is just know what you’re buying.  If you’re trying an app and it’s not working out for you, go ahead and try something else. Don’t feel bad about it. Remember that “no judgment zone.” But just make sure everything you use is moving you in the direction of what you want to achieve.  Fortunately, there are a lot of apps that can help you set up a budget to keep your saving plan as part of your priority.  So, what are you saving for? "} 
{"prompt":"What is a Marketplace Plan?","completion":" Have you ever wondered what the difference is between a Marketplace plan and Obamacare? Good news: They’re one and the same.   The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, is the landmark healthcare reform legislation. It became the law of the land in the U.S. after President Barack Obama signed it in March 2010. The ACA primarily ensures that more people have access to more affordable and more comprehensive health insurance. It does this in a number of ways.  One of the biggest ways that the healthcare law expanded health insurance coverage to more people was by creating a way for people to shop for their own, high-quality health plans through something known as the  Health Insurance Marketplace . The law also guaranteed that people could get most forms of preventive care at no cost, and that people could get the coverage they needed regardless of pre-existing conditions. Plans purchased by individuals for themselves and their families from the Health Insurance Marketplace are known as Marketplace plans. Some people also refer to these kinds of plans as Obamacare.

{"prompt":"What’s your money style?","completion":" Hi, I’m Saundra Davis, SaverLife’s financial coach. Today we’re going to talk a little bit about our money personalities or our money style.  Are you a spender, saver, or planner?  Our approach to saving or spending really is rooted in the foundation of how we live with our money in our individual personality. Some of us are savers. Some of us are spenders. Some are planners and like to know where every dollar and every dime is going.  The main thing that you want to know is: Is your style working for you? Is your style getting you what you want?  Is your money style getting in the way?  If your money style or your money personality is getting in the way of your financial health and wellbeing, there are a couple of things that you can do.   Track your financial behaviors for a week or even a month to identify if what you’re doing is getting you what you want.  If you find that there’s some changes that you would like to make, the first thing you can do is gather information about the thing that you want to change.  Say for instance you’re finding that you have overdrafts and you want to do something differently. Make sure that you know when it happens, where it happens, so that you can identify the cause and then you can identify the solution.   What are you saving for? "} 
{"prompt":"How Much Should I Save Monthly if I’m in Debt?","completion":" Saving money is always a priority, but the amount you save depends on your other goals, such as paying off debt. A rule of thumb is to save at least $1,000 to cover emergency expenses. Consider labeling your emergency account, “Debt-Proof Insurance.” The title is a reminder that the account exists to keep you out of debt. Without cash to pay for emergency expenses, you may find yourself in a never-ending cycle of paying off debt, having an unexpected expense, and having to use credit to pay for the cost. When your account drops below $1,000, stop extra payments towards debt and get your account back up to $1,000. Once it’s at $1,000, use the extra money to continue your debt payoff strategy.  In addition to saving for emergency expenses, save for the expenses you know will happen during the year. This includes scheduled car and home maintenance. These expenses should be a category in your budget.  Once you pay off your debt, celebrate and treat yourself (within reason). Then save at least three months of your monthly living expenses. Ideally, you want to save at least 10% of your income monthly. Prioritize savings like it’s a bill so you won’t have to pay a credit card bill instead. "} 
{"prompt":"What is a financial health score?","completion":"Congrats on taking this step in your SaverLife journey! Your score is on a scale of 1 to 100. Here is how to read it:   0-39 : You might feel like one financial emergency, like a blown tire or unexpected medical bill, would set you back for months. It’s hard to devote time and resources to planning for the future because the present is unstable.  40-79 : You might have some savings, but perhaps you also have a lot of debt. You’ve started to plan for the future, but not as much as you’d like to.  80-100 : You are financially stable and actively working towards your long-term financial goals.   The overall score breaks down into 4 subsection scores: Spend, Borrow, Save, and Plan. These four areas are crucial to setting yourself up for financial security.  Why should I care about it?  The score is designed to be a tool for you. Your score is a kind of “pulse check” for you to see which areas of your finances could benefit from some extra attention.  Now that you know your score, you can take action! Maybe there’s something you can change today, like setting up automatic savings or making a budget. If bigger goals like your children’s education or retirement seem unattainable, think about how to break up the long game into manageable steps.  How can I use it as a tool?

{"prompt":"The myRA program is being shut down. What should I do?","completion":"“I enrolled and contributed to myRA (Roth IRA) since August 2016. The myRA.gov program is now being shut down. What should I do with my only Roth IRA/ Retirement investment?”  Submitted by Brian H.  Admittedly, my heart was broken when the announcement about shutting down myRA® hit the news. It wasn’t perfect, but it was a way to help people do the very thing financial professionals want people to do more: save for retirement.  Do you want to continue saving in a Roth account?  You contribute to a Roth with after-tax dollars (money on which you have already paid income taxes). This means that the tax advantage of the Roth account is particularly helpful if you need the tax break more in your senior years than you do now.  So, first you must decide if a Roth is still the best fit for your needs. There are so many opinions online (I have mine as well), but in order to make this decision,  look at the facts  before you choose. There is no universal right choice – only the best choice for your circumstances.  If you do want to stick with a Roth, you have options!  1. Do nothing  Your account will be moved automatically.  According to the US Treasury website , “All open myRA® accounts will be closed and balances moved to new Roth IRAs at Retirement Clearinghouse, LLC (RCH) if no action is taken.”  2. Transfer to another Roth account  If you have investment accounts in another institution, you can do a “trustee – to – trustee” direct transfer and avoid any fees or penalties. Contact the new institution and they will walk you through the process.  The unknown variable here is the fees, so be cautious and ask questions before making any moves. If you move to an new institution, look for providers that have low fees and low minimums to open an account.  3. Withdraw the funds  This may seem like the easy solution, especially if you have looming debt. However, you can lose the benefit of the interest you have gained. While you won’t be penalized for taking out what you put in, you may have penalties if you withdraw the interest you have earned.  If you are not yet 59½ and need the funds, you can withdraw your contribution, but there will be fees: a whopping 10% early withdrawal penalty. You may be able to avoid the fees if you use the money for certain financial goals or situations, such as purchasing your first home, paying college costs, medical bills, or purchasing health insurance after losing your job.  Watch the Clock  The myRA deadlines may provide some insight. If you want to transfer to another Roth, do your research and learn a bit about investing before you take action. Check out these deadlines and consider the timing.   Beware of Fees  Whatever you decide, be wary of anyone trying to sell you something. You should not need to incur fees for this transfer. If you aren’t sure about what to do, allowing the US Treasury to place your money in a low-risk account with no management fee may be your best option.  To talk with someone (an actual human) before making this decision, find a  financial coach or counselor  who can help you consider your options with you specific circumstances in mind. "} 
{"prompt":"How should I pay off medical debt that’s been sent to a collection agency?","completion":"“My debt from an unpaid urgent care bill has been sent to a collection agency. What is the best way to go about paying off this debt?”  Submitted by Jessica J.  Medical debt is a huge financial stressors for many people. Taking action early is the best way to get it under control.  Double-check your debt  Before you agree to anything, make sure the debt is yours and is accurate. If it has been sent to collections, there are likely additional fees. Dig a bit deeper to clarify the actual amount of the outstanding debt and the fees associated with collections. This information will be helpful if you have to negotiate.  Negotiate and plan  Once you have confirmed the debt is yours, negotiate. Let them know how much you can afford to pay. Don’t feel pressured to accept their first request. Having an accurate budget that includes debt repayment can help you avoid promising more than you can pay. When you call to negotiate, have a clear solution that works for you (i.e. I can pay $XX each month for XX months) and be sure you choose a due date that will not cause unnecessary pressure on your monthly cash flow.  Get it in writing  Get the agreement in writing! This is crucial. If the debt is in collections, it is impacting your credit score. Request (and require) a written agreement that when the debt is paid they will remove the delinquency from your credit report or change the status to paid in full.  The CFPB (Consumer Finance Protection Bureau) has  sample letters and action steps  to help you through this process. If you need additional help, contact a local nonprofit credit counseling agency.  Keep saving!  As always, I encourage you to keep your saving plan (even if the amount is small) on track as you pay down the debt. "}

{"prompt":"What is the Earned Income Tax Credit?","completion":" The  Earned Income Tax Credit  (EITC or EIC) is a benefit for working people with low to moderate income. To qualify, you must meet certain requirements. You must also file a tax return even if you don’t owe any taxes or are not required to file. The EITC reduces the taxes you owe and may even give you a refund.  EITC Requirements  There are certain requirements you must meet in order to be eligible for the EITC. You must have earned income, whether it’s from working for someone or running your own business. You must also meet some additional requirements.  If you are claiming a child, your child must meet all the qualifying child rules for you (or your spouse if you file a joint return).  If you do not claim a child that qualifies you for the credit, you must meet these rules:  You must have resided in the US for more than 6 months No one else can claim you as a dependent on their tax return You must be between the ages of 25 and 65 at the end of the tax year  Income Limits for the EITC  There are limits on how much you can earn before you no longer qualify for the EITC. The number of children you are claiming will determine these limits.  For joint filers, the limit ranges from $21,370 (for couples who claim no children) to $55,952 (for couples with three or more children).   The credit can provide as much as $6,557 for 2019. If the credit is more than what you owe, it doesn’t just bring your tax bill to zero. It means you get the difference as a refund. For example, if according to the standard tax rate your tax due was $550, but your Earned Income Credit was $1,550, you would get a refund of $1000.  If you aren’t sure if you qualify for EITC, the IRS has a  publication to guide you through the process . "} 
{"prompt":"How Do You Establish Credit?","completion":"    Sign up for SaverLife  to earn points and chances to win cash prizes when you read articles like this!  Establishing credit is important. Using credit over time creates a credit history (hopefully of on-time payments) that businesses use to decide if they will give you credit. Without a credit history, companies may be hesitant to give you credit because they are unsure if you will pay them back.  This may mean paying a higherinterest rate, having to pay a security deposit or even being denied loans forhomes or cars.  The following are five ways you can establish credit.  Get a credit card  BE CAREFUL! Most people tend to  spend more with credit cards . Credit cards can give you a false sense that you have more moneyto spend than you actually have.   If you get a credit card toestablish credit, consider the following suggestions:  Set-upautomatic payments, so you don’t get a ding on your credit report for aforgotten late payment. Only use yourcredit card to pay small bills with predictable monthly payments, like acellphone or cable bill. Pay the credit card balance off monthly. Do not spendmore than 30% of your credit limit. How much of your overall credit limit youuse can affect your overall credit score.   Get a secured credit card  If youdo not qualify for a traditional credit card (unsecured credit card), you can geta secured credit card instead.  A securedcredit card requires a deposit. That deposit is typically your credit cardlimit. Similar to an unsecured card, the rule of thumb is to only use 30% ofyour credit limit. Ask your creditor if they will report your payments to thecredit bureaus. Not all secure credit card companies report to credit bureaus.   Pay your student loans consistently  Your student loan servicer reportsyour loan information to credit bureaus. If you  cannot afford your payments , loan providers, particularly  federal loan providers , offer several options to help make your payment more affordable.  Auto installment loan  Use the 20/4/10 as a rule of thumbso you don’t get a car you can’t afford.  Make a 20%down payment Finance thecar for no more than four years Thetotal cost of a car  shouldn’texceed 10% of your income (car loan payment, insurance, fuel, warranties, and averagemonthly maintenance costs) If you cannotkeep your costs to 10% of your monthly income, commit to choosing a vehicle asclose to 10% of your monthly income as possible  Become an authorized user on someone else’s credit card  Ask yourparents (assuming they have good credit) to make you an authorized user ontheir credit card. An authorized user can use another person’s credit card intheir name. The primary account holder adds the authorized user to their creditcard account.   An authorizer user benefits fromhaving the primary account holder’s credit payment history reported on theauthorized user’s credit report. As the primary account holder makes on-timepayments, it may help you establish a good credit history.  A word of caution :  If the primary account holder does not pay their bills, the late payments will be reported on your credit report. In most cases, you will not be responsible for the credit card bill.  The bottom line  Establishing credit means using good credit habits, like paying your bills on time, over time to have a good credit score. As you work to establish credit, remember to use credit wisely so your hard work will help and not hurt your credit in the future.

You’ll also need to explain exactly what you plan to do with any funds that you raise.  Funding your business can take many different forms, including:   Self-funding  using your savings or even a 401k (using retirement funds has  serious  implications, so before taking this step talk to a trusted financial professional)  Small business grants  Traditional loans  from a financial institution like a bank or credit union (you need to pay back this money with interest)  Venture capital  from investors (investors give you money in exchange for partial ownership in the company)  Crowdfunding  from friends, family, or other people who hear about your business   For more information about your funding options,  check out this guide from SBA .

{"prompt":"Should I Add My Child as an Authorized User on My Credit Card?","completion":" As a parent, you want to do everything you can to set your child up for success. And lately, the importance of helping them understand personal finance has become clear. While you work with them on saving and living within their means, you may also want to talk to them about credit.       You may even want to help them start  establishing good credit , which is a  cornerstone for financial independence . One way that you can help your child establish credit is by adding them as an authorized user to one of your credit cards. But before you add your child as an authorized user, it is important to understand what it means and how it will affect their credit and yours.  What Is an Authorized User on a Credit Card?  When you make someone an authorized user on your credit card, you are giving them the ability to charge things to your account. They will get their own card in their name. But all of the charges they make will be applied to your account, and you will be responsible for paying them. It is important to understand that any charges your child makes on the card will ultimately be your responsibility.  Benefits of Making Your Child an Authorized User on Your Credit Card  Adding your child as an authorized user to your credit card can help them in several ways. First, it can help them establish a credit history.  Because the card is in their name, they will start building a credit file. This helps them because it lengthens their credit history, which makes up 15% of their FICO credit score. The age at which you can make your child an authorized user varies by card. But it will be difficult for your child to get a credit card on their own until they are 21 (some cards can be obtained at 18 but with stricter application requirements). Adding your child as an authorized user before they are 21 will give them a longer credit history.  Another benefit of adding your child to your credit card is that gives them a chance to learn more about credit. You can teach them firsthand about responsible credit usage, never charging more than you can pay off, and always paying on time. Teaching them these necessary lessons will help them maintain a better credit score throughout their life.  Drawbacks and Risks of Adding Your Child as an Authorized User on Your Credit Card  There are a few things to keep in mind when adding your child to your credit card as an authorized user. First, it is important to remember that every charge they make is ultimately your responsibility. Have conversations about credit limits and help them be aware of what they are spending. Some parents add their child as an authorized user with the understanding their child will only charge gas, transportation, emergencies, or other certain expenses.  If you are adding them to your card to help them build their credit score, make sure that the card reports authorized users to the credit bureaus. If they don’t, having your child as an authorized user won’t impact their credit score. Your card’s reporting policy should be included in their policy statement.  What your child does as an authorized user on the account will affect your credit score, and what you do will affect theirs. So, if you’re carrying a balance on the card due to either party’s spending, both credit scores could suffer as a result. This is because you will be using more of your available credit, causing your credit utilization ratio to be higher.  Final Thoughts on Authorized Users  Adding your child as an authorized user to your credit card is a good way to help them start to understand credit and build both credit and financial responsibility. But it is important to remember that all charges they make, whether you approved them or not, are ultimately your responsibility to pay off. If you decide to add them to your account, make sure that you also help them understand credit and learn to use it responsibly. Having a good credit score is helpful in the real world and adding your child as an authorized user can help them on their path.

{"prompt":"Big Changes with the Child Tax Credit – Including an Advance Payment","completion":" Stop! Don’t know where to start when it comes to claiming the Child Tax Credit?  Take our short quiz to find out .  The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 really helped many taxpayers with 2020 Federal income taxes. But there are also tax changes for the tax year 2021 that will impact many taxpayers. One of these changes is an expansion of the Child Tax Credit for those eligible for the credit in 2021. Here is the summary of the changes:  How the Child Tax Credit Is Changing  The credit is  fully refundable . This means that taxpayers who didn’t receive the full child tax credit in previous years due to their low or no tax liability may receive the full tax credit and higher tax refunds.  Even those who earned $0 income in 2021 may be eligible .     The credit will  include children who turn 17 in 2021 . In previous years, children who turned 17 during the tax year did not qualify the taxpayer for the child tax credit. This is the  only change  to who is a qualifying child for this tax credit.  The credit amount will increase for many taxpayers . The increased amount starts to phase out (be reduced) for incomes over $150,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return and qualifying widows or widowers, $112,500 for heads of household, and $75,000 for all other taxpayers.  The child tax credit is $3000 for ages 6 to 17 (up from $2000) and is $3600 (up from $2000) for under 6 .  Payments will start in July and go through December and will be based on the 2020 tax return filing (2019 if you haven’t filed 2020 in time for the IRS to start the payments).  It’s not too late to sign up. Many families with children are eligible for this crucial tax relief – including those who have not made enough money to be required to file taxes.  The IRS has a way for non-filers to receive the Child Tax Credit.  Another change that in particular may requires some tax planning for taxpayers is the monthly payment from July-December. If you don’t want to get the advance child tax credit payments or if you want to update the information that the IRS is basing the payments on, the IRS will be providing a method to opt-out or to make those changes.   An Example of How the Advance Child Tax Credit Works  Let’s say you have two qualifying children ages 7 and 8, and you qualify to get the full Child Tax Credit and the expanded amount. Your total Child Tax Credit would be $6,000. You will receive $3,000 over 6 months, so $500 a month from July through December. This can be very helpful for many people.  However, it may cause a problem. You’ll only get $3,000 of the Child Tax Credit when you file your tax return ($6,000 – $3,000= $3,000). In previous years, you may have received $4,000. If you are used to receiving a $4,000 Child Tax Credit with your tax return but receive a $3,000 tax credit, it may cause you a problem. If you typically get say an $8,000 refund but instead get $7000, maybe that isn’t so bad. But if you typically get a $500 refund and now owe $500, that may be a problem.  What to Watch Out for with the Advance Child Tax Credit  And there can be other complications. Let’s say you claimed a child with the Child Tax Credit for the tax year 2020, but are not claiming the child for the tax year 2021. If you do nothing, you’ll receive an advance tax credit that you won’t claim on your tax return. You could end up getting a significantly reduced refund or even owing a substantial amount of money. If you get an advance on the Child Tax Credit for a child you don’t claim on your 2021 tax return, the IRS will expect you to pay it back via your tax return.   Parents alternating which parent claims a child each year may be the most common circumstance in which a taxpayer may receive the advance child tax credit payments when they won’t be claiming the child. If you claimed a child for the tax year 2020 but the other parent will claim them for the tax year 2021, it would probably be wise to opt-out of the advance child tax credit payments when the IRS provides the method to opt-out.

{"prompt":"Help is out there! Resources for when the unexpected happens","completion":"Few words describe the human experience better than the quote by writer and cartoonist Allen Saunders:  “Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.”  We all know this is true, so what can you do when things don’t go according to plan? Sure, an emergency fund can give you a sense of security for some financial situations, but what about when something you couldn’t have planned for happens?  Let’s explore some resources you can turn to when trouble strikes.  Dealing with Job Loss  Losing a job can be a devastating blow to your emotional and financial well-being. If you’re facing unemployment, prepare a plan to  manage the financial implications  and  jumpstart your job search .  Dealing with Death in the Family  The death of a loved one can leave you feeling hopeless and unsure of where to turn. Focus your attention on  taking care of the things that require your immediate attention  while being sensitive to taking the time you need to grieve your loss.  Dealing with Legal Trouble  Legal issues can come in many forms, so there really is no “one size fits all” to address these concerns. The  National Consumer Law Center  is a trusted resource for legal issues, ranging from foreclosure prevention to bankruptcy. They also offer guidance on finding and accessing legal aid in your community.  We all face situations that can leave us feeling stuck or overwhelmed. The key to overcoming any challenge is to first take care of ourselves. There is a reason that we are reminded to “put our own mask on first” before trying to help others.

{"prompt":"What Is a Pre-Paid College Tuition 529 Plan and Is It Right for Me?","completion":" For those of us who have children, just thinking about  putting them through four years of college  can feel overwhelming. In the United States, the cost of college tuition is higher than almost anywhere else in the world. And it keeps rising every year!  According to a survey from the College Board (the company that administers the SAT), the 2020 estimated annual cost was $10,560 for in-state tuition for a four-year public university and $37,650 for tuition at a private university. It costs approximately $284,570 (factoring in inflation) for two married parents with middle-class incomes to raise one child (born in 2015) to age 17, not including college costs. It’s understandable that you may find paying for college to be a challenge without assistance.  What Is a Pre-Paid College Tuition 529 Plan?  If you’re thinking about saving for college, you may have heard of a traditional 529 plan. A traditional  529 plan  is an investment savings plan in which you can save money to pay for your child’s college tuition. All 50 states and some private institutions offer 529 plans. The money that you save is invested so that you can grow your account balance faster than you would in a traditional savings account.  As an alternative, you can also save for college tuition in the Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan. The Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan is an option that public universities in nine participating states and some private universities offer. It allows you to “lock in” the cost of college tuition at today’s prices. Basically, you save in the same way that you would with a traditional 529 plan or a savings account. However, your total college tuition costs are frozen in advance. That means you don’t have to worry about whether your savings will be enough when it’s time to pay.  Benefits of a Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan  No Price Surprises . The price of tuition is written into the contract when you sign up for the plan. The price does not increase. Tax-Free Contributions . For 2021, you can contribute up to $15,000 annually per individual without triggering the gift tax. Tax-Free Withdrawals . Similar to the traditional 529 plan, the money you save will grow tax-free. You can withdraw it tax-free to pay for college tuition. Favorable Treatment for Federal Financial Aid . A 529 Pre-Paid Tuition Plan account owned by a parent is considered a parent asset. Only 5.64% of total parent financial assets are counted toward federal aid versus 20% of student-owned assets. No Restrictions for Other Colleges . If you decide not to apply to the college that is sponsoring the Pre-Paid Tuition, you can move the money in your account to any other school you choose.  Just be aware that what you have saved in your account is not guaranteed to cover the full cost of any other college.  Disadvantages of a Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan  Account Withdrawal Restrictions . Unlike the traditional 529 plan, you can only use tax-free withdrawals to pay for tuition costs. Withdrawals made to pay for other college expenses, like room and board or books, may be taxed. Residency Requirement . You must be a resident of the specific state where the public university that offers the Pre-Paid Tuition Plan is located. Pre-Paid Tuition Plans offered by private universities, on the other hand, are open to all US residents. Investment Earnings Restrictions . If you choose to attend a school other than the school that the Pre-Paid Tuition Plan is attached to, you may not be able to transfer all of the investment earnings you have in your account. Plan Open Enrollment . not all plans have open enrollment year-round. Some plans allow enrollment of new accounts only at specified times.  Before you sign up for a Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan, do your homework. Read the plan details carefully to be sure that you understand what it offers and what you’re committing to.  If you and your student know in advance that you will be applying to a specific school and want to avoid some of the sticker shock of the rising costs of college tuition, then a Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan may be the right tool for you.

{"prompt":"How do you know if life insurance is a good choice?","completion":"“How do you know which life insurance is good for you?”  Submitted by Migdalia C.  Life (and other) insurance policies are a way to protect your assets. If you think about your decision this way, you’ll have the information you need to make the best decision for you.  What are your needs?  Consider these questions:   Who is depending on you for income?  What resources do you want to leave for those you care about?  Are there any other needs for life insurance? For example: charitable donations and education for children.  How will the premiums fit into your budget now and over the term of the policy?   Evaluate your options  Once you understand your needs, you can  begin to investigate your options . By considering your needs before shopping, you’ll be better able to assess how much insurance you need and the cost you’re willing to spend.  This is a financial product, so work with facts rather than emotions. This will help you figure out if the person or company you are considering is offering the right product for your needs and budget.  Insurance policies charge fees and often pay commissions to the person selling them to you. Find a trusted resource and be prepared to ask questions to ensure the recommendation is best for you (not based on the highest commission).  Many fee-only financial planners (fiduciary standard means they don’t sell products) suggest buying term life insurance that suits your time horizon (often based on your expected employment term and/or the period of time that your dependents will rely on you for income). Term policies often last 20 or 30 years. Some believe this is “gambling” or throwing away money because a term policy has no cash value at the end of the term. The point of this type of policy is to insure against losses during the term. This means the costs will be lower than a “whole life” policy, which has an investment feature and often comes with a hefty premium.  Alternative life insurance options  If you need and can’t afford life insurance, check out  LifeBridge  by Mass Mutual. This program offers free policies for parents and guardians.  As is the case with every financial topic,  everything affects everything . Consider your entire financial picture when taking this step. "}

Claim Tax Credits  There are many tax credits that you may be eligible for, from the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to the Child Tax Credit.

{"prompt":"Understanding Your Debt","completion":" Hi, I’m Saundra Davis, financial coach here at SaverLife. Today we are going to talk about one of the biggest financial stressors in many of our financial lives: debt.  The “No Judgment Zone”  So, the very first thing is remember the “no judgment zone.” Everything that you have done in your financial past that you’re not very proud of, this is the time to remember to be gentle with yourself, and debt is often one of those areas. It doesn’t matter what you’ve done before. What matters is what are you going to do today.  Know Your Debt  One of the things we can begin with is knowing exactly how much debt we have. Not only the total amount, but the individual debts: how much, when it’s due, and how much we’re paying in interest on each one of those debts.  Balance Debt and Savings  Some of you might be tempted to stop saving while you’re trying to pay off your debt. I would encourage you to build your debt reduction budget with saving in mind. In other words, do a little bit of both. You might have to reduce your savings, but I would encourage you not to give up on it completely.  Budget for Debt Reduction  So build your debt reduction plan by identifying who you owe, when the debt is due, and how much you can afford to pay. Make sure that your budget includes debt reduction as well as saving to make sure that you don’t lose the habit of saving that you’ve worked so hard to achieve. And when thinking about your financial goals overall, keep debt and saving in mind.  What are you saving for?  Learn more about debt reduction strategies. "} 
{"prompt":"What financial conversations should my partner and I have before moving in together or getting married?","completion":" My experience talking about finances with my wife  Back in the early 90s when I was first seriously dating, the only thing I could think to ask my future wife was, “Do you love me?” At no time during the wooing process did we discuss money or finances at all. We had no money, jobs, or children and we both lived at home with our parents.   After we got married and had children and jobs, we started building a life together. But we still didn’t really talk about our finances. Even when we purchased our first home together, because I paid the bills and we qualified for the loan on my credit history and income, there were no financial discussions. At the same time, we did not have a lot of debt, we had a good credit rating, and we definitely did not have any student loans. Fast forward 30 years and we still rarely talk about the subject, but our finances are in great shape.  Debt is extremely common  Over the last 10 years, many people have taken on lots of debt, especially student loans. Americans have several different types of debt. Between credit card debt, mortgages, auto loans and student loans,  the average debt per household is about $132,529 . As of 2020, 1 in 4 Americans have student loan debt. An estimated 44.7 million people now owe  more than $1.53 trillion  in student loan debt. The average student loan debt amount is $37,172, with monthly payments of $393.  Money and love  Considering these compelling statistics and other financial factors such as income inequality, I suggest that all people in a relationship discuss finances. This is especially important if your finances are intertwined with your partner in any way. Financial issues, if left unresolved, can ruin even the most successful marriages. When a couple’s finances are not in order, it leaves both of them feeling insecure and can eventually lead the relationship into turmoil. This principle applies to unmarried couples and people in serious relationships alike. So when the relationship gets serious, discuss things like debt, credit, credit scores, and mutual financial goals together.  When I first got married, my wife and I did not discuss finances. But today I believe it’s important to discuss love and money in your relationship. These conversations, even when they are difficult, can help build trust and healthy communications with your partner. Being transparent about your financial situation will help you find long-term financial stability together.  "}

Our deeply held beliefs, values, fears, and fantasies all come into play with every single financial choice that we make.  Money Mindfulness  Being present with your day-to-day financial choices – I call this  money mindfulness  – will help make sure that you’ve aligned your behavior with the things that matter most. It’s not necessarily about changing anything right away. I encourage you first to notice:   What are you doing now?  Is it getting you what you want?  If not, what do you want to do differently?   And then making sure that you get the information and the resources that you need to align your behaviors with your end goal in mind.  Observe Your Behaviors  Start today observing your financial behaviors. You can do this in a journal or an index card or anything else that you can just keep handy so that you can track your behaviors and how you feel about your behaviors as you go through your daily routines.  Think about these questions:   What does success mean to you? Get a really clear definition of what financial success means to you and what it’ll mean for you to achieve that success.  How will your family or the people that you care about be impacted if you were to achieve the success that you desire?  What are some of the things that you could do on a day-to-day basis to move you closer toward your definition of success?

Paying monthly premium  Your health insurance coverage won’t begin until you’ve paid your first premium. Your first payment is often paid directly through your HealthCare.gov or HealthSherpa account, but is sometimes paid directly to your insurance company. If you have any questions about where your first premium payment needs to be paid, a member of the HealthSherpa Consumer Advocate Team can help. They can be reached at (844) 984-0731. Or, you can contact your new insurer directly to find out how best to make your first payment. If you do not complete your first payment by it’s due date, your coverage will be cancelled.   After this first payment, you will continue to make your monthly premium payments directly to your insurance company. Please contact your insurance company should you need further instructions on how to make these payments, though most insurance companies accept payment through an online portal, via phone, or through a paper check in the mail.   Also, once you’ve paid your first premium, you’ll usually have a 90-day grace period on any future payments before your plan is cancelled.  Coverage start date  Depending on  when you enrolled , you may have different coverage start dates.  If you enrolled during the annual Open Enrollment Period, your coverage will begin on January 1st of the upcoming year.   During a Special Enrollment Period, if you applied for coverage before the 15th of the month, your coverage will usually begin on the first day of the next month. If you apply after the 15th, it will begin on the first day of the month after next.   In some Special Enrollment Period cases, such as having a baby or adopting a child, the coverage may be retroactive to the day of the birth or adoption.  Reporting major life changes  Don’t forget to report any changes to your life circumstances throughout the year. You should report a change if any of the following occur:  Someone in your tax household was offered other health insurance through an employer, even if they didn’t enroll You got married or divorced You had a baby or adopted a child Someone in your tax household became eligible for Medicaid/CHIP or Medicare Someone in your tax household lost eligibility for Medicaid/CHIP A child on your plan turned 26 You became pregnant Your income changed Your citizenship or immigration status changed A member of your tax household passed away Your tax filing status changed Someone in your tax household lost coverage they were offered by an employer Your disability status changed Your status as an American Indian / Alaska Native or tribal member changed  These changes to your household circumstances can affect how much subsidy you qualify for. When you report a life change, your monthly premiums are automatically updated to account for this. However, if you don’t report a change, you may have to pay money back or be owed money when you file your taxes.  You can report any of these life changes through your HealthCare.gov account. Or, if you’ve enrolled through a web broker like HealthSherpa, you can do this by logging in to your HealthSherpa account or calling the HealthSherpa Consumer Advocate team at (844) 984-0731.  Health insurance and your taxes  When it comes time to file your federal income tax return, you’ll receive Form 1095-A in the mail. Your Form 1095-A will also be available in your HealthCare.gov account or HealthSherpa account. You must use Form 1095-A to fill out your taxes if you received a subsidy. "} 
{"prompt":"How will filing for bankruptcy affect my retirement?","completion":"What is your perspective about filing for bankruptcy in regards to saving for retirement?  Submitted by Chris C.  When it comes to any financial decision, everything affects everything. Kudos for thinking about the impact of bankruptcy on retirement planning. The decision to file bankruptcy is a big one, as it will impact your financial life for several years. I recommend checking out  this resource by NOLO Press  (my go-to source when I’m thinking about legal stuff) and consider the following issues:   How far are you away from retirement? If you have 10+ years left, you have more flexibility to pay down your debt and continue saving.  Do you have the financial resources to continue paying your debt  and  stay on track for retirement savings?  If retirement is near, what will your income be? Will it cover your debt payments if you decide not to file for bankruptcy?   All financial decisions are personal and there may not be a “right” answer – but that doesn’t mean you should settle for anything less than the best answer  for your situation . I recommend that you check out the link above and then contact a credit counseling company (my fave is  Consumer Credit Counseling Service of San Francisco ). Talk about the options for debt repayment to make sure you consider all of the possibilities.  Retirement is an exciting time, and there are services and support to help you choose the best option for you. If you haven’t already, try this  retirement calculator  to see if you are on track.

{"prompt":"Women Run the (Financial) World","completion":" Financial Tips for Women  Beyoncé had it right. Girls run the world; she just left out the word “financial.”  With Women’s History Month coming to an end, I could think of nothing better than to create a piece for women by a woman. Why would I want to do this?  Women have been paving the way for future generations of women. More than ever before, women are the primary earners or sole earners for their households. Women make most of the spending decisions in their household. Personally, I think this fact alone puts women in a very powerful position. Financial security is the primary goal of money management for women. Although this is also true for men, women place a significantly higher emphasis on that goal.  If you’re wondering how I can take these few things and equate that to women running the financial world, think about it like this. Women are bringing in more income. They are in charge of deciding how to best use the money they or their partners are earning. The decision of whether to spend, save, or invest is falling into the hands of women. Money spent in their community is helping local businesses, and women tend to be more intentional in the businesses they support (woman- or black-owned businesses, for example). Women are doing all of this while keeping the focus on financial security for themselves and their families.  We have power. What can we do with it?  1. Set goals  Think about what financial security means to you. Clearly defining this will bring you clarity so you know exactly what you’re aiming for. The more you can break down this large goal into smaller chunks, the easier it will be to achieve. I think of it as a set of stairs. Nobody levitates up the stairs; we must take it one step at a time. For example, SaverLife member  Gloria  identified having her own place, being in a job for more than a year, and having an emergency fund as financial stability; she was able to pinpoint three separate goals she can start working toward.  2. Budget, track, and monitor  Before spending any of your money, create a  budget . Consider what expenses you must cover and prioritize other spending. Create a plan that will help you easily track your spending, such as using cash for certain expenses. This will help you stay within the budget you set. Monitor your budget to figure out what does and does not work for you on a regular basis. Then revise your plan as needed.  3. Save  Begin saving toward the financial security goals you have identified. Although it may be easy to dismiss saving for emergencies while working toward other financial goals, having an emergency fund is a proven strategy for success. An emergency fund ensures that when an unexpected expense occurs, you have money to overcome the situation. It keeps you from taking away from your other financial goals to deal with the emergency. You never backtrack in your goals when you think of them that way. If you need some inspiration,  Deirdre  explains how she built a $5,000 emergency fund.  4. Negotiate  Women tend to be accepting and appreciative of whatever salary is offered by a prospective employer and are also less likely to ask for a raise. Before simply accepting the pay and terms an employer brings to you, consider whether you should  negotiate your pay . Increasing the amount you bring home could make a big difference in how quickly you achieve financial security, how you prioritize spending, and how quickly you build your emergency fund.   Check out  what other women SaverLife coaches shared  to gain more perspective on the financial power of being a woman.   Now, take a couple of minutes to reflect on everything you’ve just read. What is one step you are willing to take to harness your power? Write down your answer and put it in your wallet to remind you of your commitment.   Gloria and Deirdre, Thank you for being powerful women that are inspiring others this Women’s History Month! I commend you both for sharing your stories. "} 
{"prompt":"What is trailing interest and how do I avoid it?","completion":"What is “trailing interest”? I just got a credit card bill with interest charged after I paid it off!  Submitted by Sasha.  When you are using credit cards, timing is everything. The difference between the date you make a credit purchase and the date you pay can have a huge impact on the “cost of the money” you are borrowing. If you make a purchase and pay before the due date, you fall within the “grace period” for most cards. In that case, you’ll usually pay nothing in interest! That is the financial ninja move we all want to practice because when you do this, you are using the credit card company’s money for free. The catch is, not all credit card companies offer a grace period and some begin accruing interest from the moment of purchase. There are a few things to note here so let’s break it down.  Trailing (or residual) interest is accrued from the time the bill was sent to you (the closing date) and when they receive your payment. If you pay the full current balance online immediately, you can avoid trailing interest.  If you carry a balance on your credit cards, you will almost always pay trailing interest because it is accruing every day (even if you aren’t making new purchases).  Know before you owe  Thinking about your credit card usage before you make a purchase can help you stay on track to pay in full before that interest hits. It’s best to read all of the terms of your credit card (yeah, we know they don’t make it easy). At a minimum, read the fees, due dates, and grace period info. Make sure you understand all of the costs and how to avoid them.  Pay attention to your “statement balance” and the “current balance” as any new purchases and interest will be reflected there. To avoid additional interest, pay the current balance in full. Often, paying the statement balance will avoid interest as any new charges fall into the new billing cycle. Again, this depends on the card company’s grace period policy.  Timing is everything. Using credit cards for your regular monthly expenses can be a convenient way to manage money. Set a goal of using credit cards only when you know you can pay the balance in full. "} 
{"prompt":"When can I apply for a Marketplace Plan?","completion":" Open Enrollment Period  If you buy you own health insurance — versus getting health insurance through your employer — you can review your options and renew or purchase your plan for the upcoming year during the annual Open Enrollment Period (OEP). The Open Enrollment Period takes place each year from November 1 to December 15 in most states. If you’re looking to buy insurance for the first time or enroll in a new plan, this six-week period is your chance to sign up for coverage for the upcoming calendar year. In most cases, if you miss this window you’ll have to wait until the following year to pick, pay for, and get going on a health insurance plan.  Some states that run their own health insurance marketplaces extend the open enrollment period. In 2020, the following states have opted to do this:  Idaho – December 16th Minnesota – December 23rd Rhode Island – December 31st Colorado – January 15th Massachusetts – January 23rd District of Columbia – January 31st California – January 31st New York – January 31st  Even if your state has extended its Open Enrollment Period, you’ll still usually need to enroll by December 15th to get coverage that starts on January 1st.  Special Enrollment Period  There is one exception to the Open Enrollment Period. That’s when you experience a Qualifying Life Event (QLE). Qualifying Life Events fall into three general categories:   A change in where you live (if a move would impact the kind of health insurance coverage you have) A change in your family unit (such as getting married or having or adopting a child) Losing the health insurance coverage you previously had (if your spouse loses their job, if you get a divorce from a spouse through whom you were insured, the death of a spouse or parent through whom you were insured, or if you turn 26 and age off your parents’ insurance coverage).   All of these kinds of life changes qualify you to enter into a Special Enrollment Period (SEP). An SEP lets you shop on the Health Insurance Marketplace just like you would during the annual Open Enrollment Period. Your timeframe to shop and enroll in coverage is triggered by your Qualifying Life Event and not the general time constraints of Open Enrollment — and typically lasts 60 days. "} 
{"prompt":"What Does It Mean to Refinance a Mortgage?","completion":"Let’s start with the basics. Refinancing simply means that you’re replacing your existing loan with a new mortgage.  Reasons for Refinancing a Mortgage  If you’re considering refinancing, your reasons may include:   A lower interest rate  Shorter (or longer) term to pay off the loan or cash out equity  Changing the type of mortgage (you may have purchased your home with an adjustable rate and now want a fixed rate)   How to Decide if Refinancing is Right For You  There are a lot of factors that go into deciding if refinancing your mortgage is right for you. I encourage you to consider:   What’s the point? What is your goal with the refinance?  What is the cost? Refinancing is not free! Do the benefits outweigh the costs?  How long will you be staying in your home?  What other (competing) financial goals do you have? How will this impact those goals? For example, are you thinking of using equity to purchase rental property or improving the home? If you cash out the equity in your home and the value goes down, you may end up “upside down” (your mortgage is higher than the value of the home).   If You Decide to Refinance…  You’re not done when you make the decision – make sure you get the best possible refinancing deal. Here are my top tips for choosing a refinancing option:   Start with a  HUD-approved counselor  to learn about your options and the refinancing process (they will also provide unbiased information on a cash-out refi).  Shop around for the best rates and terms.  Watch how mortgage rates change over time. You may not catch the absolute lowest rates, but do your research so that you don’t fall for a sales pitch and end up with a bad loan.  If you have a trusted banker or mortgage broker, talk to them before you decide to take action. Make sure you understand all of the costs and benefits.   Your home is most likely your largest investment, and refinancing is a major financial decision. Consider all of your other goals and priorities as you gather information. I suggest you talk it through with someone who respects your overall goals and offers objective information. "} 
{"prompt":"How Do You Get a Perfect Credit Score?","completion":"    When you’re ready to start or build your credit, it’s important to understand your credit score. If you understand your credit score, you’ll be able to grow and improve it, maybe even someday achieving a perfect score.  When people discuss credit scores, they are often talking about the FICO Score. The FICO Score, created by the Fair Isaac Corporation, considers different pieces of your spending and credit usage to create a credit score for you. This score is used by lenders to assess your credit risk.  FICO scores range from 300 to 850, with 850 being a perfect score. While it is difficult, if you understand what goes into a credit score and how to use your credit effectively, you can get a perfect FICO Score.  To help you on your quest for perfect credit, here are the five factors that impact your credit score.  1. Paying on Time  Your payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO Credit score. This is the largest category. So, to work towards that perfect credit score, you want to make your credit card payments on time and in full each month. Remember to also make your full loan payments each month. On-time loan payments will also help increase your credit score.  2. Available Credit  This category looks at how much of your credit you use. It accounts for 30% of your FICO score. When lenders look at your available credit, they are comparing how much credit you are using to the total credit available to you. You want to keep your credit usage to 30% or less of your available credit. This means that you do not want to use more than 30% of the credit that is available to you. So, if you have a $1,000 credit limit, try to use $300 or less.     3. Length of Credit History  The longer your credit history, the higher this part of your credit score will be. The length of your credit history accounts for 15% of your FICO score. Initially, this part of your score will be low because you haven’t had credit for a long time. But over time this area will improve as you have and maintain your credit. Remember that if you have old credit cards that you’ve had for a while but don’t use any more, you should keep them open. Just tuck them away somewhere and don’t use them. Closing them will decrease your length of credit history and hurt your credit score.  4. Credit Mix  Your credit mix, or the different types of credit that you have, makes up 10% of your credit score. To improve your credit score and get to 850, you need to have a good mix of installment credit, or loans, and revolving credit, or credit cards. Do not take out loans or open credit cards just to increase your score. But take out loans that you need and can afford to pay back, and use your credit cards responsibly to help your score improve.  5. New Credit  There are times when you need to open a new credit card or take out a new loan, and that is just fine. But opening too many new accounts at one time can hurt your credit score. This is because opening several accounts at one time can indicate that you are a risky borrower. New credit accounts for 10% of your FICO score, so only open new credit when you need it.  Working Towards Your Perfect Score  When you are just starting out, it can seem daunting to try to build your score. Understanding the factors that affect your credit score can help you use them to your advantage. Make your payments on time, don’t use too much of your available credit, don’t open too many cards at once, and maintain a good mix of loans and credit cards. The longer you manage your credit well, the better your score will be. It will take time, but with dedication and good money management, you can work your way to a perfect credit score of 850!

{"prompt":"SaverLife’s Top 5 Tips for Saving Money","completion":"We’ve heard so much great feedback from the SaverLife Community on money hacks they use to stretch their dollars and meet their savings goals.  Let’s take a look at some of the top money-saving strategies that Savers have shared:  1. Negotiating with Bill Companies  “For our medical bills, we got payments reduced by hospital and have monthly payment plans. I always call the company when I can’t pay a full bill, I work with them.”  Credit cards companies and other creditors want to get paid and keep you as a customer, so it is in their best interest to negotiate with you – but they won’t do it if you don’t ask!  Brush up on your negotiation strategies  before you contact them, take a look at your budget, and only offer what you can reasonably pay. Once the hardship passes, revisit your budget and revise your payment plans to reduce the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan.  2. Collecting Unemployment  “I collect unemployment while I’m on break. I pay minimum balances on things and pay it back later.”  I have coached many people who are uncomfortable about applying for public benefits. Social supports like unemployment and food and rental assistance exist to help you through hard times. If you are facing financial challenges, check into  eligibility for benefits  to help you get back on track.  3. Taking It One Day at a Time  “I take it one day at a time. I like being creative. I try to figure it out because I always have in the past.”  Great advice! A mindful approach to dealing with a shortfall may reveal options you overlook if you react to the emotions or try to tackle everything at once. If you have options other than your savings that is great, but if using your savings is the best choice to deal with the situation, do what you must and rebuild when you are financially stable again.  4. Doing Odd Jobs  “We’re always getting by. We haven’t lost anything but we struggle sometimes. We do other odd jobs, brainstorm how to help each other open our own businesses. Soon my son will be in 1st grade, so I could get a full-time job. We’re feeling like we don’t want to just get by anymore, we want to be comfortable.”  Side jobs and short-term gigs can help you bridge financial gaps or can even become a regular income stream. I have been self-employed for more than 20 years. I have never worked harder or been happier.  Fiverr  and  TaskRabbit  are turnkey ways to jumpstart your side hustle.  5. Relying on Support Networks and Savings  “In a low period of income, we count on my girls or borrow from my parents. In a high period, we set aside money as savings.”  Family or community support is often the best way to handle a short-term cash flow problem. And it’s wise to set aside extra money in savings when you have a financial windfall. Don’t worry about the fact that you have to use it. That’s exactly the reason to set it aside!

Picture this : you’re chugging right along making all the right moves to achieve your financial goals then… BAM! Something happens (A car accident?

Otherwise, a little problem can turn into a big setback.  How much do I need in my emergency fund?  Don’t know how much should be in your emergency fund? That’s okay. Start with a simple solution (that is sure to help you sleep better at night).  Our friends at Nerdwallet have an  easy calculator  to help you figure out a target emergency fund based on your monthly expenses. Now, if that amount makes you scream and toss your computer across the room (don’t do that), you can always start with this approach: add up the amount of all your insurance deductibles (medical, car, renters/homeowners) and set that as your baseline for your emergency savings account. Having the money to cover your deductibles means that, in the event of a serious emergency like a car accident or injury, you can cover the deductible without going into debt.  Being able to cover your deductibles is a great start. With this approach, you’ll be able to deal with the most common financial emergencies. An emergency fund of just $500 will help you feel more prepared and less panicked if an emergency hits. "} 
{"prompt":"What is an Opportunity Cost?","completion":" Opportunity cost is an economics concept with huge implications in every aspect of our lives. To put it simply, when you say “yes” to one thing, you are saying “no” to another.  Opportunity Cost in the Real World  Let’s try an example. Say your goal is to build healthier habits by exercising every day. When you wake up in the morning, you can either get up to exercise as you planned, or you can go back to sleep to get more rest. Both exercise and adequate sleep are important, and you only have time to do one this morning.  So which do you say “yes” to, and which do you say “no” to? There’s no correct answer. And only you can decide which is more important to you at that point in time.  Think about opportunity cost in terms of how you spend your time. In each moment, you can only be in one place doing one thing. There is always an opportunity cost of the other things you could be doing.  Opportunity Cost of Your Money  Opportunity cost is a helpful concept for thinking about how you spend your money. If you spend a dollar on one thing, that dollar is not available to spend on something else (or to save or invest).  But this isn’t about shaming you for spending—it goes both ways. When you save in a retirement account or invest in the stock market, that money usually isn’t available for your immediate needs and wants. That’s another opportunity cost. Those dollars can only be used for one thing.  Consider the Big Picture  So does this mean you shouldn’t save or invest, because that money won’t be available for other things? Of course not! When thinking about opportunity cost, I want you to make all financial decisions with the bigger picture in mind (what you’re saying “no” to by saying “yes” to something else).  When I leave my home and pull up directions for how to get somewhere, the app tells me the fastest route. It doesn’t tell me that the longer route (which takes a whole eight minutes more of my time) takes me along a beautiful reservoir that fills my heart with joy.

Each dollar can only do one thing (that’s called an opportunity cost), so you must be ready to decide which is most important when your priorities shift, even if only for a short period of time.

{"prompt":"What Are the Best Alternatives to a Traditional Savings Account?","completion":" A basic savings account can be a great place to start when you’re new to saving. It’s also an excellent choice if you have a small balance. There are alternates if you need a more robust savings plan or want to  increase the amount of interest  being paid.  Money Market Account  A  money market account  is a step up from a traditional savings account.  They normally have a $1,000 balance requirement to open without a fee. The withdrawals are limited to six per month. The interest rate is a little higher than the basic savings account and is usually tiered. The higher the balance you have in the account, the higher the interest rate you’ll receive.  Certificate of Deposit (CD)  A Certificate of Deposit (CD) pays a higher interest rate as well. When you open a CD at a bank or credit union, you are committing to keeping those funds in that institution for a specified amount of time. You can commit to as little as a few days to several years. This is called the maturity date.  If you are willing to commit to keeping those funds on deposit, the financial institution will pay you a higher interest rate than a savings account or a money market account. Generally, the longer the time on deposit, the higher the interest rate you will earn. You will pay a penalty if you take the money out before the maturity date.  High-Yield Checking Account  A  high-yield checking account  is another alternative. These accounts became popular about ten years ago. They usually don’t have a minimum balance requirement, but instead require a direct deposit each month, a minimum number of debit card uses, or other requirements set by the bank or credit union. If you meet these requirements, you will earn the higher interest rate. If not, you don’t earn any interest and may even incur a service charge.   You can always start with the smaller savings account, and then, as your balance grows, branch out to a money market account or a CD. The important thing is to save!   "}

If you don’t do that, you are simply leaving money on the table! For instance, your employer may match 100% of your contributions up to 5% of your salary. That means if you make $40,000 and contribute 5% of your salary ($2,000), your employer will contribute an additional $2,000. You are effectively doubling your money before anything happens in the stock market. If I came up to you and guaranteed that I would double your money if you invested with me, would you take me up on that?  Reasons to contribute more than the employer match amount  Should you stop there or contribute more than your employer match amount? Well, that depends on how much you have already saved. A good rule of thumb is to have one times your salary saved by age 30, three times by 40, and six times by 50 for retirement readiness. If you are running behind, you should probably try to contribute more than the employer match amount. Another important factor to consider is your goals. At what age do you want to retire? What type of lifestyle do you want in retirement? It may be necessary to increase your 401(k) contributions to reach your goals.   Small contributions can make a big difference   Contributing to your 401(k) and foregoing that money from your paycheck can seem tough. However, it’s important to contribute whatever you can, especially if you are young and have plenty of time to experience compound investment returns. For instance, based on the historical average of stock market earnings, contributing just $50 a month would grow to an estimated $100,000 in 30 years ($200,000 if those contributions were matched by the employer)! You should consider increasing your contributions as you get older and your income increases. A good rule of thumb is to start by contributing the employer match amount and then increase your contributions by one percent a year.  A 401(k) can be a powerful tool to save for retirement. If you’re not sure how much to contribute, don’t get frozen with indecision and miss out. Just go with your gut and see how it goes; you can always make adjustments later if necessary.  "}
