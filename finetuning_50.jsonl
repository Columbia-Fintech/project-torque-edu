{"prompt":"Should I Rent or Buy a Home?","completion":" Renting versus owning – how to determine which is right for you  Choosing whether to own or rent a home is a big decision. The “right” answer for you will be deeply personal, based on a few key considerations that we will explore below.  1. Examine your personal values  A good place to start is with your personal values. What is really important to you in your life? Family? Freedom? Security? How do these values fit with different housing situations?  2. List and prioritize your goals  Next, think about your future. Where do you want to be in five years – financially and in general? What other financial or life goals do you have? These could include reducing your debt, paying for education, or moving to be closer to family. Where does homeownership rank among those goals?How might it affect your other plans?  3. Weigh the trade-offs of renting versus owning  Every decision has trade-offs – things you get and things you give up. Both renting and owning come with their own sets of trade-offs.  Owning a home is an important goal for many people. Homeownership has many advantages, but also requires a significant investment of time, energy, and money. It comes with responsibilities and risks.  To help make the choice that is right for you, weigh some of the trade-offs 1  listed below. Think about which would impact you the most and what you care about.  Benefits of Owning: Shelter and Wealth-Building  You may want to own a place that is all yours – a home that you can modify to fit your needs. Or, you may want to build wealth and increase your net worth over time. For many people, their home is both a shelter and their largest financial asset. When you own a home, you build equity by making monthly payments that reduce your mortgage loan balance. You can also build equity when your home increases in value over time. Equity is the value of your home minus what you owe. While you want this to be a positive number, home equity is not guaranteed.  In summary, here are the benefits you should consider:  Greater control over decisions related to home and living environment Potential to build equity Possible tax benefits Roots in one community and school system No home inspections by landlords or other authorities, greater privacy With a fixed rate mortgage, principal, and interest payments stay the same  Drawbacks of Owning: Maintenance Costs and Less Mobility  Understandably, homeownership is not for everyone. You have to make repairs when needed. You have to change your spending habits, so you can make your monthly payments on time and save for emergencies and repairs. Many people choose to rent so they can have the freedom to move around. Or you may prefer that your landlord has to take care of maintenance and repairs.  Read through these downsides of owning and think about how you value them compared to the benefits of owning.  Risk of property value loss Limited flexibility with relocation Higher upfront costs (compared to renting) Usually higher monthly costs for housing and utility expenses Liability for accidents on the property Responsibilities for home repairs, maintenance, and yard work  Both renting and owning require you to make payments on time. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing your home through eviction or foreclosure.  4. Take a look at your current financial situation.  In this moment, where are you financially? How would you rate your  financial health ?  Your financial health can affect your ability to rent or own a home. Most landlords and all lenders will consider your credit history, for example, when deciding to rent you a place or give you a home loan. Lenders, however, look more carefully at your overall financial health when measuring your ability to buy a home.  You will need a credit score of 620 for a conventional loan or 580 for a government-backed FHA loan to buy a home.  Additionally, you must have enough saved for the upfront costs of homeownership, including the down payment and closing costs. On average, these costs add up to 15 percent of a home’s purchase price. Finally, you must show that you earn enough to make the new mortgage payment while continuing to pay your living expenses and debt.  If you wish to buy a home and your financial health does not yet measure up, what would it take to get you financially ready?  5. Get more information  If you are leaning toward homeownership, sign up for a homeownership education class from a  local nonprofit organization . Buying a home can seem like a complicated process, with many people and steps involved. A class can give you the tools and knowledge to successfully navigate the purchase process and take a realistic look at what you can expect from homeownership. The more you know, the easier it will be if you decide that homeownership is right for you.  1  Trade-offs adapted from  Motivational Interviewing  by William R. Miller and Stephen Rollnick. "} 
{"prompt":"Everything You Need to Know About High-Yield Savings Accounts","completion":" When it comes to saving money, where you save it can be almost as important as saving it. There are many different savings options available today. One that is often talked about is the high-yield savings account (HYSA). But what is a high-yield savings account and when is it the best choice for your savings?  What is a High-Yield Savings Account?  A HYSA is a savings account that has a higher interest rate than a regular savings account. According to  Investopedia , HYSA interest rates are typically 20-25% higher than the interest rates of regular savings accounts. This higher interest rate allows you to earn more on your savings. Online banks typically offer the best rates on HYSAs. If you’re considering opening a HYSA, it’s important to understand the benefits as well as the downsides.  Benefits of a High-Yield Savings Account  One major benefit of a HYSA is that it allows you to earn more interest. This helps your money work harder for you and can help you reach your savings goals even faster.    Another thing that can be helpful for some people is that a HYSA allows you to separate out your savings. Because HYSAs are typically offered by internet-only banks, you often cannot open one at the same institution as your checking account. Having an account at another bank for your longer-term savings goals can help you separate these goals from your day-to-day finances. This separation can keep you on-task and ensure that your savings are used for your intended purpose.  Even with accounts at multiple banks, it is still easy to transfer funds. Typically, HYSAs at internet banks will allow for electronic funds transfers to and from your regular bank. This is helpful because it makes contributing to your HYSA easy. You can also often use the bank app to deposit checks into your HYSA. This access is helpful when your accounts are at different institutions.  Drawbacks of a High-Yield Savings Account  When considering a HYSA, it’s important to also understand some of the drawbacks. Some HYSAs have more rules that regular savings accounts. They may require you to meet an initial minimum required deposit to open an account. When you are just starting to save money, this can create an unnecessary challenge. HYSAs also sometimes have account maintenance fees and other charges. These charges and fees may cancel out the benefits of the higher interest rate.    One big drawback of some HYSAs is the time that it can take to transfer funds from your savings to your everyday checking account so that you can use them. The time that these transfers take is heavily dependent on which banks you are transferring to and from. This is definitely a part of a HYSA that you’ll want to understand when you open your new account.  It’s important to note that like all savings accounts, HYSAs are subject to the banking regulation known as Regulation D. This limits certain types of transfers and withdrawals to and from the account to six per month. Make sure that you understand these limitations when moving money in and out of your savings accounts.  Final Thoughts on High-Yield Savings Accounts  Overall, the HYSA is becoming more common in the personal finance community. A higher interest rate can help your money work harder for you.   HYSAs are a good place to save for your bigger goals like buying a house, buying a car, or taking a trip. Depending on the transfer times for you to access your funds, a HYSA could also be a good place to save your emergency fund.  As with any financial product, when you think about opening a HYSA, be sure that you do your research. Find the best account for your particular situation that will work as an integrated piece of your financial plan.  Consider the fees, minimum required deposit, and whether you need access to a debit card or ATM for the account as you pick which institution to use.  A high-yield savings account offers you a great savings opportunity with a higher interest rate. It might fit in well with the rest of your personal financial plan! "} 
{"prompt":"What is a Health Savings Account and Should I Open One?","completion":" If you have a High Deductible Health Plan for your health insurance, then you are eligible for a Health Savings Account (HSA). You can use HSA funds to pay for qualified medical expenses. These expenses can be incurred by you, your spouse, or any dependents listed on your tax return.  There is no need to submit receipts, but you do want to keep these as proof that you used the money for qualified medical expenses. This will come in handy should you ever have an IRS audit.  Advantages to Opening a Health Savings Account  Lower your taxable income.  The money you put into the account is pre-tax. This reduces your taxable income you file your tax return. HSA accounts earn interest tax free.  This means you won’t have to claim the earnings as income on your tax return. HSA contributions don’t expire.  If you don’t use all the money in your account, then it can roll over to the next year. There is no need to “use it or lose it.” You can invest your account into a variety of investments.  There is no minimum requirement. Just remember that some investments are not FDIC insured, so there is a potential to lose money. You can use your HSA as a retirement account.  After you turn 65, any money in the account can be used for any purpose. It is no longer restricted to qualified medical expenses. This makes the account a potential retirement account.  If these advantages are appealing to you and you have a High Deductible Health Plan, then you may want to open an HSA. Saving for medical expenses, and having a great vehicle in which to do it, is an awesome idea!

{"prompt":"7 Questions to Figure Out If You Can Claim Someone as a Dependent On Your Taxes","completion":" It can be confusing to figure out who you can claim as our dependent on your Federal tax return. It’s typically clear whether or not you can claim a child as a qualifying child. The other kind of dependent is a qualifying relative (and they don’t always have to be a relative). This can get a bit more complicated.  There are 7 dependency tests to pass in order to claim a qualifying relative.   1. Dependent Taxpayer Test  To claim a person as a dependent, they cannot be eligible to be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return.   2. Joint Return Test  Usually a person cannot be your dependent if they filed a joint tax return with their spouse. There are some exceptions to this rule. So if you think you should be able to claim someone whom has filed (or will file) a joint tax return, consider doing more research.   3. Citizen or Resident Test  The dependent must be either a US citizen, US National, US resident alien, or a resident of Mexico or Canada. An adopted child passes the this test if the child lived with the taxpayer all year and if the taxpayer is a US citizen or US national.   4. Relationship or Member of Household Test  The following pass this test:  A son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of these. A brother, sister, half brother, half sister, or son or daughter of any of these. A father, mother, or a direct ancestor or sibling of either of them. A stepbrother, stepsister, stepfather, stepmother, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law. Any other person (other than the spouse) who lived with the taxpayer all year as a member of the taxpayer’s household if the relationship does not violate local law. There are some reasonable absences allowed.  5. Not a Qualifying Child Test  The dependent must not be the qualifying child of any other taxpayer for the year.   6. Gross Income Test  The dependent must have a gross income of less than $4,300 in 2020. This includes all income that is not exempt from tax. This is important to note because some people have income that is exempt from tax.   7. Support Test  The taxpayer must provide over half of the dependent’s total support during the year. This doesn’t apply to certain dependents of divorced or separated parents or if a multiple support agreement applies, or if the dependent is under the rule for kidnapped children.   I know this is a lot to consider for something that seems like it should be simple. But many people have households that are more complicated than a parent or two and their children. And if you are in one of those households, I encourage you to take a close look at who can and can’t be a qualifying relative, because under current tax law a qualifying relative qualifies most taxpayers to receive the $500 credit for other dependents. You can  read more and use the IRS’s Interactive Tax Assistant tool .  But one word of warning. Before claiming a dependent, make sure you understand the impact claiming an individual as a dependent may have on any benefits they receive from Federal, state, and local governments.  "} 
{"prompt":"Setting Your Financial Goals","completion":"Goal setting is an inside job.  Think about it. We set our goal first, focusing on a specific and achievable financial target. To be clear, saying “I want to be more financially stable,” or “I want to increase my credit score,” is not the same as setting a goal. We’re talking about what you want to save for, how much you’ll need to get there and when you want to reach that goal. We’re talking dollars and dates.  Let’s start with the “WHAT”: describe one financial goal. Don’t skimp on the dream either, and be very clear about what you want to achieve. Go on, I’ll wait…  Okay, now that you have  named  your first financial goal, think about how your life will be different when you have achieved it. What is your motivation and how will you know when you are satisfied? This is your “WHY.”  Once you know the “WHAT” and “WHY,” we’ll work together on the “HOW,” which is, of course, the only way we achieve our goals. But don’t worry about the “HOW” just yet. For now, just get that exact goal on paper. See how easy that was?  Bottom line? A financial goal without a date and a dollar amount is just a dream.  Taking Action  Here are a few ideas to help you get started on establishing your goal:   Index cards: write your goal and your “why” on an index card and put it somewhere that you can see it often.  Pinterest : build a virtual vision board of one (or more) of your financial goals.  Goal Buddy : This is a tool to help build your goals, define the habits to help you get there, and create tasks that can be exported to your calendar. Oh, and it’s free!  "} 
{"prompt":"What Is a Credit Report?","completion":"Your credit report is a summary of all of your reported financial history. Keep a close eye on this to make sure that it is accurate because it determines your credit score.  Checking your credit report is a first step to achieving some of your financial goals. It’s a good idea to check your credit reports (there are three of them) annually for accuracy.

{"prompt":"How do I find my credit score?","completion":" How do I find out my credit score? Who wants to know it, and what factors influence its change ?  Submitted by anonymous .  A credit score is a representation of how someone managed their debts. It is meant to help creditors understand our financial responsibility. Payments on our loans and balances on our credit cards are two factors that directly influence our score. In today’s world, having a good credit score means greater chances of having access to money (or other services) in less time, with fewer requirements, and at lower interest rates (or cost).  Who calculates credit scores?  There are several companies that have created credit score formulas. How does it work? They collect historical information about us from our credit reports, run it through their algorithm — and wallah! This process results in a final number (credit score) that is compared to see if we are above, at, or below average. Depending on where we fall, we will qualify or not for different loans or services. Financial entities, for example, buy this information from these companies when evaluating the conditions of a loan contract. It is their way of determining the responsibility we assume when managing our debts.  How credit scores are used  Credit scores are primarily used by financial institutions, such as banks and lenders. But in recent years, they’re increasingly used for other things. For example, insurance companies use credit scores to calculate the price of our auto or life insurance policies. Landlords use them to make renting decisions. Some employers even look at credit scores when hiring. All of them see the credit score as a way to measure responsibility. You can see from these few examples that credit scores are really important in our society.   How can you influence your credit score?  To answer this, we will take one of the most commonly used scores, the FICO score, and see how it’s calculated. Although the exact formula isn’t public, the risk experts who put together the FICO score say it’s based on:  Payment history (whether we pay in time or not) – 35% The amount owed (how much of our credit lines we are using, hint: the more you use, the worse) – 30% The length of our credit history – 15% The types of credit – 10% Inquiries (how often we apply for credit) – 10%  You can find your FICO credit score at  myfico.com .  In short, we can influence our personal credit score by always paying on time, not using a high percentage of our credit lines, having a long credit history, having a variety of credit, and not applying for credit (or services that require a credit check) often.  However, we cannot do magic.  What do I mean? We can positively affect the factors that influence our credit score over time, but this change doesn’t happen instantaneously. Improving your credit is about changing long-term financial behaviors. And changing behaviors of any kind can be challenging. That is why things like paying our bills on time are always stressful. It’s not complicated; it’s about being consistent. "} 
{"prompt":"5 Things to Keep in Mind When Selecting a Savings Account","completion":"A savings account is one of the simplest bank accounts you can get. Nearly all U.S banks and credit unions offer savings accounts. It’s worth it to shop around because accounts have varying fees, minimum balances, and interest rates. Keep the following things in mind when selecting an account.  FDIC Deposit Insurance  You should only bank with financial institutions that are FDIC insured. FDIC insurance protects customer bank deposits up to $250,000 per depositor in the event of bank failure. If a financial institution doesn’t have FDIC protection, pass on it.  Monthly Fees  Read the fine print before opening a new savings account. Some banks will charge fees and you need to know what they are up front. Here are examples of some fees you may encounter:   Account maintenance or administration fees  Withdrawal penalty fees  Minimum balance penalty fees  Deposit penalty fees  ATM use fees  Account link/online banking fees   If your bank does charge any of these fees (not all do), ask your account manager if you can get a fee waiver.  Online Account Access  Today, almost every banking institution has an online presence. You want to make sure you can sign in and access your savings account online so you can bank when, where, and how you want to. Plus, SaverLife only works with savings account that have online access!  Automatic Transfers  Setting up automatic fund transfers to your savings account is one of the best ways to easily save money each month. Make sure that your financial institution and savings account has this capability.  Interest Rates  Financial institutions have varying interest rates so make sure to comparison shop before settling on an account as you’ll want to earn the most competitive savings rate possible. Interest rates at most financial institutions are low right now (generally 2% or less) but it’s still worth it to get the best rate possible. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Build an Insurance Plan to Protect What Matters Most","completion":"We all face risks every day, from driving a car to the ever-present risk of illness or natural disasters. Protecting yourself from these varied risks is a complex task.  Consider a relatively simple risk: adopting a pet. Picture your newly adopted dog, maybe a little frazzled by his new environment. You’re out on a walk and a neighbor approaches your dog. The dog takes a nip at the stranger and now your neighbor has to go to the emergency room for stitches. As she backs away she lets you know that she intends to sue you for the emergency room cost.  Even if you have homeowners’ or renters’ insurance, your policy may not cover this liability. There’s no “perfect” or “right” insurance plan; this is another case where you need to consider your unique circumstances and determine how much risk you want covered.  Here are a few steps to get started:  Do an Inventory  The first thing you need to know is what people, possessions, and other things you want covered. It might help to make a list of everything you can think of. Consider these broad categories:   Health  – your own and other people (or animals) in your family  Life  – how will your family cope with the loss of a family breadwinner?  Children  – how will they be protected?  Property  – what land, structures, or possessions are vital to your family?  Income  – what if you or another family member are unable to work?   Assess Your Risk  There are four ways to manage risk – some are more expensive, and some may not always be practical. One or all of these methods may be appropriate to make sure you are covered adequately.  Risk Avoidance  Eliminate the risk by not engaging in activities that could trigger the risk. For example, you might decide that having a pet or going on a vacation is not worth the risk, so you’re not going to adopt a pet or go on vacation. Of course, this is not always practical, and requires you to sacrifice a lot.  Risk Transfer  An insurance policy allows you to transfer the risk to another entity (the insurance company). Of course, you can never fully transfer a risk. If you’re in a car crash and you have car insurance, your  financial  risk will be covered, but that doesn’t erase any injuries or legal liability.  Risk Reduction  There are easy things you can do to limit risk and increase precautions. For example, to limit the risk of a house fire, you could install smoke detectors. To limit the risk of injury when driving, wear a seatbelt and drive carefully.  Risk Retention  Risk retention means that you decide to accept a risk. In an ideal world, all of your risk would be covered in some way, but of course that may not always be possible. Maybe you decide that you can’t afford to buy a certain type of insurance, and that you would prefer to mitigate your risk and accept any unfortunate consequences. Even if you buy insurance, most plans still require you to first pay a deductible; this deductible cost counts as a risk that you retain.  Build an Asset Protection Plan  Now that you know the different methods for dealing with risk, it’s time to sort out how you want to manage the risks in your life. Put together a plan for each item that you identified in your inventory. It could look something like this:     Asset  Approach  Action    Life  Transfer  Research and buy life insurance     Reduce  Eat healthy and exercise    Auto  Transfer & Retain  Buy car insurance, but retain some  risk with a high-deductible plan     It can be difficult to think about the unpleasant possibilities that life could throw at us at any time. Building an asset protection plan can offer you reassurance that you’ll be able to address these unexpected life events. Who knows, with proper planning you may still be able to adopt that dog! "} 
{"prompt":"What Is Adjusted Gross Income?","completion":" It’s that time of year when you hear tax terms being tossed around, whether on the news, at work by the HR Department, or over coffee with friends. But what exactly do all these terms mean? A commonly used term is Adjusted Gross Income or AGI. What is AGI, and how do you calculate it?  Your adjusted gross income is the amount of money you earned minus all allowable adjustments. You want this number to be as low as possible. Once you know your AGI, you’ll subtract either the itemized deduction amount or the standard deduction amount. The resulting number will be used to calculate the amount of tax you owe. The lower your AGI, the lower the amount of taxes you need to pay.  How to Calculate Your Adjusted Gross Income  Step 1: Calculate Your Income for the Year  This includes your salary, of course.  It could be from Social Security, IRAs, or pensions.  Don’t forget any business income you’ve earned or money from a side hustle. Include alimony and unemployment in this calculation.  Step 2: Add Up All Allowable Adjustments  Here is where you want to find as many as possible. Remember, the lower you get your income, the less tax you have to pay.  Schedule 1 of Form 1040  has a comprehensive list of all the adjustments available. The adjustments are:  Educator expenses Certain business expenses Health Savings Account deduction Moving expenses for members of the Armed Forces Deductible part of self-employment tax Self-employment SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans Self-employment health insurance deduction Penalty on early withdrawal of savings Alimony paid IRA deduction Student loan interest Tuition and fees deduction  Some of these deductions require additional documentation or forms.  They will also be available on the IRS website.   Step 3: Subtract Total Adjustments From Total Income  Congratulations! You have just calculated your Adjusted Gross Income.

{"prompt":"Can’t Wait for Your Tax Refund? Here’s Everything You Need to Know About Refund Advance Loans","completion":" Tax time is an important time for most families. You find out if you’re getting a tax refund. And this year, that assistance is more valuable than ever. For all of those who are wondering, the IRS will start sending out tax refunds in early March. If you anticipate that you will receive a refund this year, or you are claiming your Recovery Rebate Credit through your taxes, you may be looking forward to —and need— those funds.      If you absolutely need your tax refund before the IRS can send it to you, here is a quick guide to all that you need to know about a product you may have heard about: the Refund Advance loan. A Refund Advance loan is debt. It is a loan against the tax refund you are expecting to receive. It is usually between $200 and $4,000. Sometimes, you can get the loan within 24 hours.   You may find yourself in the position where getting money sooner rather than later can make a big difference. For this question, I am setting aside my tax professional hat and putting on my Accredited Financial Counselor® hat. As a financial counselor, I would prefer that you not pay unnecessary fees and charges or to place yourself at risk of having unexpected debt. But I also know that life happens. I suggest asking yourself three questions before rushing to any lender for fast cash.  1. Can I Wait? What Are My Other Options?  This year, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IRS has changed some of its filing dates. They started processing returns on February 12. Tax credits and refunds are expected to go out in early March. This means it may be a few weeks before you receive your funds.   If your bills are paid and you don’t need that money immediately, then can you wait a few extra weeks? If you are planning to make a big purchase, wouldn’t it be better to avoid paying fees and have more money?   2. How Much Does a Refund Anticipation Loan Cost?  The biggest reason to avoid a Refund Advance loan is the cost: it can be expensive. The fees can vary quite a bit, even those ones that offer a 0% loan.  Some  of these have already closed applications for loans, but for those that are still open, the costs can range from zero to hundreds of dollars in tax preparation fees. Usually, the costs of the loan are built-in to the tax preparer’s fee, or the tax preparer may sell additional services to you to pay for the loan. Here is an example: a taxpayer takes out a $500 tax refund loan, and pays a $59 tax preparation fee. This amounts to an APR of 142%.   It’s a good idea to ask yourself if you have other things to spend this money on that would be better for you. Is the charge really worth getting your money faster? Most Americans can  file their taxes for free , and don’t need to pay the tax preparation fee that is bundled with the loan.  3. Can I Accept the Risk and Do I Understand the Terms?  This is the part that often gets ignored. I have shown my clients Refund Anticipation loans in the past. And I’ll tell you, it is rare for someone to actually read the terms and conditions. Typically, they glance and sign. Sometimes not even glance! What you need to be aware of is what happens if your refund is delayed. What happens if the IRS requests additional information before processing your return? Will that increase your costs with additional fees and charges? What happens if the IRS doesn’t give you a refund or gives you a smaller refund than you filed for? Will you get more charges? Will that negatively impact your credit if it happens? I ask these questions because these things all happen. Make sure these risks are worth taking before agreeing to a refund advance.  It’s also important to know more about the lender. In general, borrowing directly from banks is safer and cheaper, because banks are regulated by the government.    This tax year is different from previous years. This year, many households have received unemployment insurance, and this is taxable. (Stimulus checks are not.) If you believe you will owe taxes on any unemployment insurance you received, that can reduce your refund, which can impact the amount that you’ll have to pay back on any Refund Anticipation loan that you take.   ***  If you don’t truly need the money right away, I encourage you to avoid a refund advance. You can put the money that would have gone to more fees toward paying off debt, toward your kids, or whatever is important to you. "} 
{"prompt":"What Are the Benefits of Good Credit?","completion":"    Equifax, one of the top three credit reporting bureaus, considers  credit scores between 670-739 to be good credit scores . FICO is one of the most commonly used credit scoring companies.  FICO  uses information from credit bureaus like Equifax to calculate a three-digit credit score that represents your credit. The scores are calculated based on five categories:   Payment History (your record of paying your bills on time) – 35% of your credit score. Amount Owed (how much of your credit are you using) – 30% of your credit score. Length of Credit History (how long have you had credit) – 15% of your credit score. Credit Mix (how many different types of credit you have) – 10% of your credit score. New Credit (how often you are applying for credit) – 10% of your credit score.  Good credit history of on-time payments, not using too much credit, not trying to get a lot of credit, and having different credit types give businesses an idea of how much they can trust you to pay your bills on time. In a nutshell, if a company feels you will pay them back, you will typically pay less than someone a business may not think will pay them back.  Here are some of the benefits of having good credit:  Lower Annual Percentage Rate (APR)  This is the interest you pay to your creditor for using their credit. The better your credit score, the less interest you pay.   No Security Deposit  Businesses often lower or even eliminate security deposits for people with good credit. Companies use deposits as “insurance,” so if you don’t pay your bill, the business will keep your deposit to pay the missed bill. This is why companies ask for a security deposit from people with no or low credit scores.  Buying a Car  Your credit affects your ability to own a vehicle in a few ways:  Places where you can buy a car . Some dealers will not finance someone with a poor credit score ( typically under 580 for some businesses ) The amount of your monthly payment . Your car payment is a combination of the car’s principal cost and your loan interest rate mixed in with other fees: the higher your interest rate, the higher your car payment. Your ability to get car insurance . Many insurance companies  use your credit history  to decide your premiums or even if they will give you car insurance.  Buying a Home or Rent an Apartment  Your credit score significantly affects your ability to own a home due to the following:  Home loans : Your credit score determines which types of  loans you can get . The more loans you are eligible for, the better. Your credit score determines how much interest you pay, affecting your overall monthly payment. Apartments : Most landlords will review your credit report. Some apartment buildings may require a minimum credit score to approve your application. A high score may also mean a reduction in a security deposit for your apartment. It may also reduce or even eliminate a security deposit for utilities.  Homeowner’s and Renter’s Insurance  Like car insurance, a  homeowner’s  and  renter’s  insurance company will review your credit, which may impact your premiums, meaning more money you may have to pay for your insurance coverage.  Getting a job  Most employers will check your credit. Some employers, like a bank, may require you to have a good credit history.

{"prompt":"How to Be a Holiday Hero while Sticking to a Budget","completion":"Holidays can be filled with  both joy and stress .  As a starting point, think about the end of the holiday season. How do you want to feel? What experiences are important to you? And of course, what do you want your credit card balance to look like?  What are the holidays about?  As you go into the holiday season, think about what lessons you want your children to take from your celebrations. This is a good opportunity to teach the value of time. Your presence is just as important as the presents. Here’s a list I like of  ways to be present  during the holidays.  You’re setting the foundation for how your children will experience family traditions when they are adults. You’re also modeling financial behavior to your kids, and  teaching them about advertising . What legacies do you want to establish?  Commit to a holiday budget  Our families, and especially our children, may have expectations or wish lists for the holidays. But what do you want to drive your purchasing choices?  If you decide in advance how much you want to spend and how you’ll allocate that money, you may end up in a much better place in January. Once you have a plan, talk to your children about what is important during this season (ideally, before they make that huge list for Santa).  Alternative gift ideas  If you decide to cut back on toys and games, you can still mark the occasion with a different kind of gift. Coupon books for fun holiday activities with your kids are a great way to build memories together.  Plus, with the money you would have spent on toys, you can give investments, 529 contributions, or savings accounts. I think of this as saving money for your kids instead of spending money for them. In the long term, they’ll appreciate the investment in their futures.  ***  The holidays can be a time of community and connection that focuses on our presence with our children. What is one thing you can do to have a holiday season that is restorative and rejuvenating? For more ideas about how to plan for a happy holiday season,  check out this resource . "} 
{"prompt":"SMART Goals Can Help You Achieve Your Dreams","completion":" Think about something that you want to accomplish in the future, like paying off credit card debt or student loans. Have you set a goal that will help you get there, or is it just something that you hope will happen? There is nothing wrong with hoping, as long as it is not your final step. A hope can be vague and open-ended, but a goal is what will guide you in achieving your desired outcome.  How to Create SMART Goals  How can you turn your hopes into goals? By thinking SMART! SMART is an acronym that can help you remember the components of an effective goal. Your goals should be  S pecific,  M easurable,  A chievable,  R elevant, and  T ime- bound. Let’s look at an example.  Specific  Some people tell me, “I want to live debt free!” That’s great, but that is not a very specific goal. In order to fix your goal, you should look at the amount of debt that you have. Let’s say you have $10,000 in credit card debt. Instead of simply wanting to live debt-free, you can say that you want to pay off your $10,000 credit card debt. That is a specific goal. Now how can you achieve it?  Measurable  “I will pay off some of my credit card debt each month until I am no longer in debt.” Do you see the problem with that plan? It is not measurable. Paying “some” money toward a credit card does less to hold you accountable than if you say, “I will pay $500 per month toward my credit card debt.” $500 per month is measurable, but does it meet the next requirement?  Achievable  Being able to pay $500 per month toward your credit card debt is great, but make sure that this goal is achievable. Take into account your income as well as your other expenses. If $500 per month interferes with your ability to pay rent or your electricity bill, you may need to adjust your goal amount to something more feasible. You should also be realistic in your time frame expectations. For example, “I want to pay off my $10,000 credit card debt in three months” might be too difficult a goal to achieve.  Relevant  Make sure that the goal is relevant to you and your lifestyle. If paying off your credit card is not important to you, you will probably not make this goal a priority, which sets you up for not meeting the goal.  Time-Bound  You can determine how long it will take to pay off your debt by dividing how much you owe by how much you will pay each month. How long will it take you to accomplish the goal of paying off $10,000 in credit card debt? If you pay $500 per month, it will take 20 months to completely pay off $10,000 of credit card debt. ($10,000/$500 = 20 months.) It is important for goals to have a time frame or deadline to keep you accountable and on track. Remember, the target time frame should be achievable.   Setting SMART goals is a good method for achieving whatever your goal may be. Remember to always make sure your goals are  S pecific,  M easurable,  A chievable,  R elevant, and  T ime-bound. This will help make your hopes into goals, and your goals into reality!  With hard work and commitment, you can achieve financial freedom! "} 
{"prompt":"What is Lifestyle Inflation?","completion":" Have you noticed that even when your income increases, it can feel like you still don’t have more money leftover at the end of the month? That’s because often, when our income increases, our expenses do too. This is a very real phenomenon called  lifestyle inflation . It can sneak up on us despite our best intentions to save.  Pent-Up Demand  Lifestyle inflation is often caused by something called pent-up demand. In other words, with your lower income, you were sacrificing something you wanted or needed in order to save for a specific goal (read more about  opportunity costs ) or because money is tight.  Now that you have a higher income, you start spending more money on that pent-up need. Consider these examples:  You get a raise and buy a new car that you’ve been needing for a while. You get a better-paying job and start eating out more because the job is more demanding and you have less time for shopping and cooking. After graduating from college, you get your first job. But you also start sending more money to support your family members who’ve helped you along the way.  Money Mindset  You want your higher income to get you closer to your overall financial goals, but your money mindset can get in the way. Sometimes when people are accustomed to struggling financially, they spend their way back to what feels comfortable.  Learn more about your money mindset with this video I made about  finding your money style .  How to Avoid Lifestyle Inflation  There are a lot of reasons that our expenses often increase as our income increases. So how do we avoid that?  The trick is to set short, intermediate, and long-term financial goals and hold yourself to them. Create a policy for yourself about what you will do with increased income. Make sure your goals are specific and measurable. For example, you may decide to automatically save 10% of any windfall or increase in salary.  As always, it’ll be easier to follow through on your goals if you know your “why.” Remembering your goal will help you stay on track when you have multiple financial priorities.  "} 
{"prompt":"“What credit card refinancing options do you recommend?”","completion":"What are some credit card debt refinancing options you recommend?  Submitted by anonymous.  My favorite approach to debt reduction is  a payment plan . It helps you reduce interest by paying the debt in a way that works within your budget. A payment plan also minimizes the risk of consolidating, which can incur additional debt.  If you decide that refinancing or consolidation are best for you, here are a few options to consider:    Balance transfer to a 0% rate card : This seems easy enough, but there are some factors that you should think about:  Are you opening a new credit account or using an existing card? New accounts impact your credit score, so think about this before taking this step.  Can you manage your spending and avoid increasing your overall debt? If you pay off one card by using another, how will you manage that “open” line of credit?    Consolidation loans : This can be a good choice, but watch those interest rates AND be sure you have a spending plan that helps you stay on track so you don’t continue to use the cards you paid off.  Home equity lines : This is NOT a good option. Credit card debt is “unsecured,” which means you don’t lose any collateral (an asset that the creditor can take if you don’t pay), but if you use a home equity line to consolidate, you put your home at risk by “securitizing” the debt.   Using a tool like this  debt reduction calculator  can help you find the best of both worlds: you can build a plan to reduce the debt without additional consequences or fees.  "} 
{"prompt":"How can I manage money with a partner who has different money habits?","completion":"Do you have any advice for managing money and budgets with a partner who has a different view of spending and saving than I do?  Submitted by anonymous.  Ah, love and money! This can be blissful or stressful. For many people, money can make or break your relationship. It is pretty common to partner with someone who has different perspectives about money. Opposites attract, right?  Talking about money  early  in a new relationship is the best way to put your cards (see what I did there?) on the table and figure out how you want to manage money as a couple. Money problems rank as one of the top 10 reasons for divorce, so having a money talk at any point in the relationship can save headache and heartache.  Here are some tips for having a productive, collaborative talk about money:   Start by finding a neutral place to have the conversation. Minimize distractions and create an environment that is comfortable for you both, like a coffee shop or park.  Agree to focus on your desired outcome rather than what the other is “doing wrong.”  Identify an area that you EACH would like to focus on and choose a goal. Where do you want to end up? For instance, if you’re both stressed about emergency savings, find a target amount you both want to save and discuss how you can work together.  Working with a financial coach  is also helpful if you find that you need an objective third party to help you build a roadmap.  Most importantly, listen to each other. Try to understand what is important to you as a couple and what approach is likely to get you there.  "} 
{"prompt":"If I Can Pay off My Debt, Is it Better for My Credit to Pay it off Slowly or All at Once?","completion":" I think I’m going to receive a large tax refund this year that could help me pay off my debts. If I’m able to pay off all of my debt, should I do it all at once or is it better for my credit to pay it off slowly over time?  Submitted by an anonymous SaverLife member  There are several factors that go into your credit score. A lot of the answer to this question depends on what is currently being reported. In general, if you can pay off all your debt, you should do it! There isn’t much better than being debt free and owing no one.  Now, before you pay off all your debt, if you don’t have a fully funded emergency fund, you should do that first. Have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a separate savings account for those rainy days that we all experience.  After this is done, then pay off your debt. If you are now unable to pay it all off, then you need to at least pay each credit line down to one third of its limit. For example, if you have a credit card with a $1,000 limit, pay it down to under $333. This will help your credit score. Do it for each card. How much you owe is the second highest contributing factor to your credit score.  Next, if you haven’t started this already, you have to make every remaining payment on time, each and every month. No exceptions. Your payment history is the biggest contributing factor to your credit score. The only way to change this is to start paying on time immediately. As the creditors begin to report your on-time payments, you will see an increase in your score, but again, this will take a while.  Now if you are lucky enough to be able to pay off all your debt  and  fund your emergency fund, then go ahead and do it. Lock up all but one of your cards in a lock box. The one you are keeping out, charge a monthly expense (such as gas or groceries) and then pay if off at the end of the month. This will keep your payment history building. "} 
{"prompt":"Why Do Different Companies Show Different Credit Scores?","completion":"Why do different companies show different credit scores? Credit Karma showed my score 70 points higher than the banks!  Submitted by StillLearning.  Ah, the mysteries of credit scores. Let’s get the nuts and bolts down, then we can talk about the best approach to getting the information you need. There are several credit reporting companies and they each use different calculations. The key to managing your credit score is to know the source of the information and your reason for tracking your score.  How Credit Scores Work  Let’s look at how your credit score works step by step.   Lenders report to one or more of the credit reporting companies, which are also called credit reporting bureaus (Experian, Equifax, Transunion).  The three bureaus keep their own reports of your payment history. They create their own score and report to  FICO  and  VantageScore .  Whew! Take a deep breath and check out this  infographic  that might help all of this make more sense.   Federal law requires that the three reporting bureaus provide you with a free  credit report  (a record of your borrowing and payment habits) every 12 months, but you often pay for your FICO score.  Credit scores  are big business because they are used to determine your eligibility for loans and what your interest rate will be. Low scores generally mean higher interest – YIKES!  There are some free credit scores that are often called “educational scores.” These are modified by the bureaus and offered through secondary sites like Credit Karma and Credit Sesame. These sites can be helpful if you are learning how to manage credit and they often have excellent tools to explain complex concepts. However, you may notice that the scores are not the same as FICO or VantageScore.  Pop Quiz  Read the following statement from the Credit Karma website and tell me why the score provided may differ from FICO.  “Credit Karma shows your scores from Equifax and TransUnion, calculated using VantageScore 3.0. It’s free and there’s no impact to your credit.”  (Cue Jeopardy music) YOU GUESSED IT! The score doesn’t reflect information from Experian.  Here are a few more things about your credit that you should know:   Checking your own credit report and score never impacts your credit score. So there is no reason to be wary of checking your score.  The “educational” scores often are from sites that want to sell you financial products. Be WARY of ads to upsell you from the “free” service.  Don’t count on free scores if you are planning to borrow money or apply for a mortgage or rental. Check your real credit reports for accuracy and pay for your FICO score so you know what to expect from a lender. The  Consumer Finance Protection Bureau  is a trusted resource for approved credit counseling agencies. The CFPB can help you obtain and review your credit reports. They can also help you create a plan to build credit or address problems with your credit history if necessary.   Take charge of your credit score by understanding how it works and what you need to do to verify accuracy and build a solid credit history.

{"prompt":"How to Balance Long-Term and Short-Term Savings Goals","completion":" We all know it’s important to save money. But how do you balance saving towards both your short-term and your long-term goals? I recommend creating a savings plan that takes your budget, goals, and timeframe into consideration. This can help you be successful in saving in both the short and long-term.  Define Your Goals  First, you must define your savings goals. Get specific! Write down two or three savings goals you have. Assign each goal a due date. This lets you distinguish between short-term goals, those you can reach in one to three years, and long-term goals which take more than three years. Also, write down why you want to achieve each goal. Be as clear as you can. Your “why” keeps you motivated.  Pick Your Savings Method   Next, you need to pick your saving methods. This can depend on the timeframe for your goals and also on your risk tolerance. For short-term goals where you will need the cash sooner or you want to have easier access to it, a  high-yield savings account  is a good choice. It lets you earn higher interest but also gives you quick access to your cash with no penalties or fees. For longer-term goals, you might consider savings vehicles that have a higher return, like  investment accounts . Or you may have a retirement account that your employer maintains. Always factor in when you’ll need the money and understand any taxes, fees, or penalties associated with the account you choose. There is also a lot of evidence to support having a separate account for each goal.  Know Your Budget  Now it’s time to figure out how much you can save each month. This means creating a budget. Review your spending for the last several months.  Determine how much money you need to meet your necessary expenses. Make sure to account for the bills you pay each month, your groceries, debt payments, and other expenses that you have to pay to get through the month.  Next, look at what’s left. This is where you will find money to save. Identify things you spend on each month that aren’t necessary. What can you cut? How much you cut depends on how much you want to save and how hard you want to hit your goals. It can be helpful to not allocate every spare dollar to savings and keep some “fun money” in your budget. This helps you stay on track and not feel so limited. Identify how much you can comfortably eliminate and remember you don’t have to cut out discretionary expenses entirely. Just cutting back can help you save.  Divide Your Savings Between Goals  Now you need to divide your savings between your goals. Using the goal completion dates you wrote down, determine how many months you have to reach each goals. Divide the total savings you need by the number of months until you want to complete each goal. This will give you how much you need to save monthly to reach your goal. Now divide up your monthly savings between each goal using how much you have to save towards each goal.    If you don’t have enough to fully fund each goal, you’ll have to prioritize. Some goals, like an emergency fund, are time-sensitive. Other goals, like saving for retirement, may need to be prioritized in order to take advantage of an employer match. Think about the goals that you have written down and how achieving each one reflects your values and changes your overall financial picture. Fully fund your top priority and allocate any unused savings towards your next priority. Once you reach your top priority you can add those savings to your next goal to achieve it sooner.  Track Your Progress   Now that you have a savings plan in place, you’ll want to track your progress. Whether you use a pen and paper, Excel, or an app, be sure to record your monthly savings towards each goal. This will help keep you motivated!  Repeat the Process  Setting savings goals isn’t a one-time thing. As things change, you’ll need to repeat the process. And as you achieve your short-term savings goals, you’ll want to start the process over and set new goals or save more towards your existing goals. No matter what, be sure to celebrate your wins and milestones along the way! Acknowledging your achievements will help keep you motivated going forward. "} 
{"prompt":"What’s the Best Way to Pay Off Debt?","completion":" There are a couple of ways to get out of debt and back on track with your finances. Let’s walk through some straightforward steps together!  Start with Budgeting Basics  To start with, make a budget. Total up all your monthly take home pay. Next, start to subtract all of your expenses. You will want to subtract your housing, car, gas, food, entertainment, clothing, insurance just to name a few. Be thorough and honest about your spending. Once you’ve subtracted everything, hopefully you have a positive number. If not, you need to go through all your expenses and decide where you can cut back until you do have a positive number.  Doing this will allow you to free up extra money to put toward your debt, and will also keep you from going further into debt.  Non-Profit Credit Counseling  One option is to work with a non-profit credit counseling agency. They will negotiate lower payments, a lower interest rate, or both with each of your creditors. From there, you pay them a small monthly fee along with the total new monthly payments and they make your payments for you.  This can be extremely helpful if you are feeling overwhelmed, are receiving phone calls, or can’t get out from under the debt due to huge interest rates.  To learn more, find a legitimate  credit counseling agency .   Debt Reduction Plan  Another option is to set up your own debt reduction plan. You can do this easily using a tool I like called  PowerPay . It’s a free website. You will put in all your debts, including the dollar amounts, interest rates, and minimum payments.  You will have also put in how much extra you can pay each month. This is where your budget comes in handy! Even if it’s a small amount, it will make difference. The website will then calculate how long it will take you to get out of debt, and even print you a calendar showing how much to pay on each debt, each month.  (The directions for this site are on the homepage, on the right-hand side.)  Finding the Right Plan for You  The difference between the two programs is that with PowerPay, you still make the monthly payments, the interest rate stays the same, and the cards remain open. When using a Debt Management Program through a credit counseling agency, you make a payment to the agency and they pay your creditors each month. The interest rates are lowered but the cards will close.  You can also use a combination of both of these plans if there are cards you want to remain open, but others you want to close.    ***  The burden of debt can be overwhelming. Making a plan to tackle this debt can help lower your stress and allow you to see a way out. With a little hard work, you can be debt free. "} 
{"prompt":"How much should I save before I buy a house?","completion":" Buying a home is a big life decision. One of the questions that will come up is how much you should save before starting the home buying process. Here’s how to answer that question.  Buying vs. renting a home  The first step is to make sure that you’re buying a home for the right reasons. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that  renting is “throwing money away.”  Although you build equity in the property over time when you own your home, most of your  mortgage  payments in the beginning  go to interest .   In order for buying a home to be a financially beneficial decision, you should plan to stay in the home for at least five years. That’s why it’s important to consider the possibility of life changes. How secure are your current job and salary? How long are you planning to stay in your area?   One way to look at a rental payment is that you are buying flexibility. If you need to move across the country for family reasons or for an amazing career opportunity, you won’t be tethered to a property. This  New York Times calculator  can help you weigh the tradeoffs of buying vs renting.  What can you afford?  The next step is to calculate how much home you can afford to buy using a  home buying calculator . Don’t forget to factor in costs such as homeowner’s insurance, HOA fees, and maintenance. I usually recommend that my clients refrain from buying the most expensive house they can afford (you probably won’t hear that from lenders and realtors!). It’s important to leave room for increasing expenses in other areas, especially expenses related to family and children.  Saving for your down payment  Many mortgages require a 20% down payment. This means that you are effectively borrowing 80% of the home’s value and paying for the rest outright.  Now that you know your price range, ask yourself how long it would take you to save for a 20% down payment. If it would take longer than you’d like, consider purchasing a less expensive home. Keep in mind, especially if this is your first home purchase, this may not be your forever home. In fact, if the value of your home holds steady or increases, you can use the sale proceeds to help you buy a more expensive home. Another route to consider would be  first-time home buyer programs  and other promotional loans (vary by lender). These loans require down payments as low as 3.5% or no down payment at all. Keep in mind that these loans come with a higher interest rate, a larger mortgage payment (because the interest rate is higher and you are borrowing more of the home’s value), and the cost of  private mortgage insurance (PMI) . A low down payment also leaves you more vulnerable to the real estate market. If the value of the home were to fall, then you would immediately be “underwater.”  Other fees and expenses  Once you know how much you need for the down payment, make sure you set aside enough money for home inspection fees and due diligence (anywhere between $500 and $2,000) and closing costs (2% to 5% of the purchase price). It’s also important to have at least six months of expenses saved in your emergency fund. An emergency fund is even more important when you’re a homeowner, because if your appliances need to be fixed or replaced, there’s no calling the landlord. You own the property, so you have to pay the expense yourself.   Happy home buying! "} 
{"prompt":"Should I Save If I’m in Debt?","completion":" Saving money is important. Saving might seem difficult, especially if you are struggling to make ends meet or if you are in debt. However, everyone can create a savings plan. Even as you work toward paying off debt, saving is necessary and possible. If you put all of your money toward debt, you won’t be able to handle everyday financial challenges. No matter your circumstances, saving for your future should be a priority.  Why Should I Save?  People create savings plans for different reasons. Here are some common reasons why people save even if they’re in debt:  Emergencies  – Emergencies are those unexpected expenses that, without a savings plan, can be detrimental to your finances. A car or household appliance may need repairs; you or someone in your household may need medical treatment. In times like these, having some money already set aside in an emergency fund is a big help. Your emergency fund may start out small, with a goal of $300 – $500. Once you reach that goal, you can increase your goal to $1,000.  Loss of income  – Sometimes unexpected events occur that result in a loss of income. Someone in your household may get laid off, or a job where income fluctuates may go through a low period. In this case, it’s helpful to have a reserve fund set aside. Try to set aside enough money to be able to cover a few months of expenses to give yourself time to regain a source of income.  Monthly or annual expenses – You may also benefit from saving for recurring expenses. Monthly expenses like utility bills or rent, and annual expenses like school supplies or holiday shopping, can be included in your savings plan. In these cases, the money you set aside will  only  go to these specific expenses that you expect to recur every month, year, or quarter. Personal goals  – It is great to strive toward personal goals. You may be eyeing a new television or car, or a family trip. Even if you can’t make those big purchases right away, setting money aside will help you make those purchases in the future.  How to Save   There can be obstacles to saving. You do not have to set aside large amounts of money at a time. You can start small and add to your savings as time goes on. It’s important to get into a habit of saving.!  Save a percentage of every dollar that comes into your household. This will add up in the long run.  Decrease your spending. Lower your cable service. Lower your phone service. Cancel a membership or subscription to a service that you do not use often. Eat out less. Choose less expensive brands of products. You can then set aside the money that used to go to these other costs. Increase your income. You may be able to get a second job or work some overtime. Sometimes extra income is unexpected. For example, you may get a bonus at work or a large tax refund. Instead of using the extra income as extra spending money, or even putting all of the money toward your debt, it is a good idea to set aside some of the money in an emergency or reserve fund.  Where to Save  Once you have money to save, it is a good idea to designate a place to put that money. I recommend storing your savings separate from your spending money so you are not tempted to spend it. You can open a savings account with your bank or even a separate bank. You can have separate accounts for emergencies, expenses, and personal goals. Make sure you know your bank’s policies and possible fees associated with a new account. Some people put their savings onto a prepaid card. Again, carefully read your card’s policies and fees if you choose this option.   Even though it may seem difficult, setting money aside for the future is important and possible. There are many reasons and methods when it comes to saving. Find what works best for you. Despite the obstacles, start saving for your future.   With hard work andcommitment, you can live debt-free! "}

{"prompt":"New Years Anti-Resolutions for 2020","completion":" I’m going to suggest something a little radical for the new year and the new decade, 2020. Instead of focusing on a new year’s resolutions, consider listing the things you are going to  stop  doing. Ideally, these should be self-sabotaging habits and behaviors that prevent you from achieving your goals.  Here are a few ideas to get you started:  1. Let Go of Unsupportive People  You will stop (or reduce) your communications with unsupportive people. Anyone who truly cares about you also cares about what’s important to you, including your goals. Beware of people who discourage you from sticking to your goals. I genuinely believe this is why the “unfollow” button and the ability to send calls straight to voicemail exist. Be intentional with who you invite into your life. There are amazing private Facebook groups with people trying to achieve your goals; join one. Find a local support group, a Bible study group, your group of people. I like to call these your “battle buddies.” These are people with shared goals and similar struggles. You can encourage each other.  2. Break Up With Your Credit Card  You will stop buying items with a credit card. It’s tough to pay off credit debt when you are still using a credit card. You tend to spend, on average, 25% more when you use a credit card instead of cash. Consider committing to using your debit card for expenses and using only cash in areas you typically overspend in (eating out, groceries, clothing, etc.).  3. Stop De-Prioritizing Saving  You will stop putting savings at the bottom of your to-do list. Putting money into your savings should be at the top of your spending plan. There will never be a good time to start saving. Consider using payroll deductions to have a portion of your paycheck go directly into your savings account, so you don’t have to think about it. Remember, it’s more about the habit of saving first rather than the actual amount you save.  4. Never Shop Without a List  You will stop going to the grocery store without a shopping list. I have never heard of anyone who considers a trip to the grocery store to be a stress-reducing experience. It’s crowded, overwhelming, and no matter what time you go, it’s an inconvenience. First, shop your pantry and refrigerator. I cannot tell you how many times I bought something I already had, or I already had all the ingredients for a meal. Next, think through the meals you want to make. You can easily find budget-friendly meals online. You don’t have to get fancy. Start with a few quick meals like spaghetti or hamburgers. The point is to limit your meals out.  Hopefully this gets you thinking about what you may need to stop doing in 2020.

{"prompt":"How do I know what is a “need” and what is a “want”?","completion":" Just seeing the word “budget” can give some people a headache. Instead of reaching for a bottle of aspirin, I suggest changing the way you think of a budget.   A budget is a tool that helps you use money so that you reach your goals. You control what you spend money on and how much money you spend. A vital part of a budget is getting clear on what is a need vs. what is a want.  The difference between a “need” and a “want”  Need : Spending that is essential to you being able to survive. Necessary spending includes basic food, a place to live, transportation to take you to work, insurance, and essential clothing.   Want : Spending based on a desire for something that is not essential to survival. This includes cable, gym memberships, eating out, entertainment, travel, and designer clothes.  It sounds easy, but it gets hard when we use this to purchase an essential item, then justify upgrading the purchase way above the amount needed to meet our basic needs. Below are a few examples.  Is a car a “need” or a “want”?  Should you purchase a new vehicle with upgrades that use nearly half of your take-home income, or should you buy a slightly used car with no upgrades? Also, some areas have excellent public transit. Having a car may be a “want” if you can get to work, school, and buy essential items like groceries without a car. In this case, the car is a convenience that is a want, not a need. If your car breaks down due to normal “wear and tear” repairs in your owner’s manual, can you fix it instead of buying a new car?  Is my house or apartment a “need” or a “want”?  Generally I would consider your house or apartment to be a “need.” After all, we need shelter to live. But you may classify it as a “want” if you are:  Buying a home when you can barely pay your bills and don’t have savings Renting an apartment with extra space for, even though you rarely have guests over Paying more in rent so you can live in the trendiest area that’s close to everything, instead of choosing a safe but cheaper apartment  What food is a “need” versus a “want”?  Food is also certainly a “need.” But that doesn’t mean that all food is a “need”! Here are a few examples that come to mine for me:  Not having a meal ready when you are hungry or busy does not turn eating out into an essential expense If you are on a tight food budget, the more convenient the food item (pre-cut veggies, pre-bagged, pre-cut chicken, etc.), the more expensive the cost. It shifts the food from a need to want because you can buy a cheaper option.  Are my clothing and travel a “need” or a “want”?  Needing a bag for your laptop does not justify buying a Coach bag. Likewise, I certainly want you to take a break from work, but not if it means going into debt. You can do a “staycation” in your area!  ***  Separating your needs from your wants allows you to create a spending plan based on the most important things to you. Maybe if you drove a cheaper car, you may be able to afford your dream vacation.   Every financial decision you make, no matter how small, will either get you closer to your goals or become a barrier to reaching your goals. Understanding needs and wants can help you prioritize how you spend so that you can reach your financial goals. "} 
{"prompt":"Three Calming Strategies for Managing Money Anxiety","completion":"Mo’ money, mo’ problems?  It’s one thing for The Notorious B.I.G. to say, but if you’re experiencing financial stress in your daily life, you’re not likely to agree. When you feel like you can’t make ends meet, it may seem like money is the cause of (and solution to) all your challenges.  Here are a few things you can do when money has you stressed out:  1. Stop and Breathe  I know breathing seems like a no-brainer, but think about how often you find yourself holding your breath when you’re feeling stressed out. Attempting to find your way forward when you are feeling overwhelmed may actually hinder your progress. Developing a  healthier response to stress  can help you manage financial anxiety and more accurately assess your options.  2. Be Mindful  Notice when stress has a grip on you and increase activities that soothe or calm you. Meditation, playing music, or talking with trusted friends can give you the mental space and encouragement to treat yourself kindly. Think about how you would respond to a loved one who was struggling with money, and show yourself that same kindness. As always, there’s an app for that, so if you need some support, check out  mindfulness apps  for your computer or phone.  3. Focus on the Future  Recognize that financial challenges are generally a combination of internal (things you can do) and external (economic or environmental) events. So place your attention on what you CAN control. Abusing yourself with thoughts of what you “shoulda, woulda, coulda” done is just a recipe for more anxiety. Remember the “no shame zone” and be gentle with yourself as you identify what actions you want to take.  Financial distress is one of the most common stressors, so learning how to deal with the stress is often the first step to finding your way to financial wellness. "} 
{"prompt":"Buying a house seems unattainable for me. What can I do?","completion":"“Thanks you for your blog and articles to educate oneself. I hear a lots about affordable housing, which concerns me because the prices on these houses are still not attainable for people like me. I want to buy a home with the Habitat for Humanity program. Can you give insight on what it takes to own a home? Thank you.”   Submitted by Josephine D.  Home ownership can seem unachievable when you look at the cost of housing in many areas. Fortunately, there are several programs like Habitat For Humanity that can help you build a financial foundation (see what I did there?) and create a path to owning your own home.  There are a few basics steps that anyone seeking to purchase a home must complete. When money is tight and buying a home seems out of reach, a good first step is to learn about the homeownership programs in your immediate area (or in another locale if you are considering moving to a new city or town).  The Housing and Urban Development Office (HUD) has a list of  HUD-sponsored housing counseling services  across the U.S. A HUD housing counselor will be able to tell you about federal and local programs that are available and can often determine your eligibility by asking a few questions about your financial situation and family size.  It is easy to look at all of the steps and become overwhelmed or discouraged, so don’t start with a list. Start with a call. Get the information that is relevant to your specific circumstance and learn what you would have to do to achieve your goal. With good planning and the support of a program like Habitat or others, your goal may be closer than you think. "} 
{"prompt":"What are the Metal Levels in Marketplace Insurance?","completion":" When you start planning for Open Enrollment, your first question may be which metal level of health coverage is right for you. Health insurance plans in the  Marketplace  fall into  four metal-level tiers : Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze. These metal levels reflect the differences in how costs for your healthcare are split between you and your insurance company. Generally speaking, plans with higher premiums have lower annual deductibles. And plans with lower monthly premiums tend to come with high deductibles. Depending on the amount of medical costs you end up with in a year, different metal levels will offer different kinds of value to you.   The different metal tiers in no way reflect a difference in the level of care you receive.   Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, all Marketplace plans must cover the following 10 categories of  Essential Health Benefits :  Ambulatory patient services (outpatient care you get without being admitted to a hospital) Emergency services Hospitalization (like surgery and overnight stays) Pregnancy, maternity, and newborn care  (both before and after birth) Mental health and substance use disorder services , including behavioral health treatment (this includes counseling and psychotherapy) Prescription drugs Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices (services and devices to help people with injuries, disabilities, or chronic conditions gain or recover mental and physical skills) Laboratory services Preventive and wellness services  and chronic disease management Pediatric services, including oral and vision care (but adult dental and vision coverage aren’t essential health benefits)  No matter which plan type you select, all Marketplace plans are Qualified Health Plans. And these plans must offer a  set of preventive care services  – including many vaccinations, cancer screenings, and birth control – for free when you visit an in-network healthcare provider, even if you haven’t met your deductible yet.

{"prompt":"Cut Your Expenses with a Savings Scavenger Hunt!","completion":"If you review your spending over the last month, you can almost certainly find one regular expense you can reduce. Then you can put the money toward savings instead. Grab a snack, put on some good music, and get your bank and credit card statements from last month (go ahead, we’ll wait)…  Okay, scan through the statements and categorize the things you spend money on each month. Start with broad categories like “living expenses” (what you must pay) and “lifestyle expenses” (what you spend to enjoy life more). Once you do that, focus on a monthly expense that you want to tackle. It doesn’t matter which category. Just pick something that you will reduce consistently.  Now you’ve chosen a category to reduce, it’s time to brainstorm. Think about what changes you want to make. For instance, if you want to reduce your restaurant spending, first think about what is important to you about eating out. Is it the meal itself, or is there more to it? When you eat out, are you alone or with other people? If you reduced this expense, how would you get that need met? Having a plan for the change you want to make will help you be more consistent.  There are only three things you can do if you want to change your financial life: make more, spend less, or a combination of the two. Remember, there’s no judgment. Just align your spending with what matters most.  Will you pledge to do a one-month savings bump based on your scavenger hunt? "} 
{"prompt":"Guide to Filing Taxes as an Independent Contractor","completion":" New to being an independent contractor? Here’s what you need to know about taxes.  Being an independent contractor or gig worker comes with more flexibility. It also comes with new tax responsibilities.  At a high level, the IRS considers you an independent contractor, and therefore self-employed. You are paid for the result of your work, not for how or when you do it. The “self-employed” status generally translates into higher tax rates and more cumbersome tax filing. But it also generates some potential new tax deductions.  Let’s walk through some things you need to know about taxes as an independent contractor.  You’ll be paying a new tax: self-employment tax  If you’re self-employed, you pay self-employment tax (approximately 15% of your net business income) and federal income tax directly to the IRS. The self-employment tax includes Social Security and Medicare taxes. This generally means that you’ll pay a higher tax rate.  Quarterly estimated tax payments  You probably need to make quarterly tax payments to the IRS. This is especially important if you believe you’ll owe more than $1,000 in income tax when you file. These payments represent an estimate of what you will owe in taxes for a given year based on your projected income and deductions. They are typically due to the IRS on April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15. These payments can be a big burden for new contractors, as you are now responsible for withholding your own taxes on income and paying them at the appropriate times. It’s important to pay throughout the year so you don’t end up short on cash or with a tax penalty at tax time.  The IRS has more information on  determining and paying your quarterly estimated tax payments .  New tax forms  You’ll generally receive and use new tax forms. As an independent contractor, you need to file your own business taxes on Form 1040 (the standard tax return). You’ll use a Schedule C to report income and expenses and a Schedule SE to determine your self-employment tax. You may need to fill out new state and local tax forms as well.  Whenever you receive $400 or more of income, you should receive a Form 1099 (instead of a W-2 for employees) at tax time that you must report when filing your income taxes. However, you may not always receive official tax forms to track your income. You are still liable to report all of your income, so you’ll need to keep your own records. See the  IRS’s Tax Guide for Small Business  for more information on federal tax laws and the self-employed.  Tracking your income and documenting your expenses  Being self-employed requires a lot of organization and documentation. You need to set up financial systems for tracking your income, documenting your expenses, regularly setting aside money for taxes, and paying your estimated tax bills on time.  You may start with a simple Excel spreadsheet for tracking your business finances. If it’s getting too complicated, consider budgeting software like QuickBooks or Quicken or expense trackers like Expensify or Stride. Carefully track your expenses to maximize your eligible tax deduction and minimize your tax liability.   From the start, establish a separate savings account for your taxes. Set aside at least 20% of your income in that account to be able to pay your taxes on time and in full.  Business-related deductions  You may be able to get some new tax breaks from business-related deductions to reduce your federal income tax obligation. Along with the new tax responsibilities of being an independent contractor come a few tax benefits. Namely, expenses that might otherwise be considered “personal” can be deducted as business expenses. These include services, items, or amenities you use for business purposes. Some common examples are phone and internet, office supplies, use of your personal vehicle, a portion of rent, certain meals, and health insurance.  Business deductions effectively reduce your business’s taxable income and could lower how much you owe in federal income tax. But deductions have their limits. To understand the rules of deducting business expenses, see this  guide from the IRS .  Is an accountant right for you?  You may want to hire an accountant to protect yourself. A certified public accountant will understand how federal taxes work. They can help you manage your new responsibilities, avoid costly mistakes and tax problems, take advantage of available deductions, make filing your taxes easier, decrease your overall tax liability, and safeguard the health and longevity of your business. While an accountant is an extra cost, it can also provide peace of mind and might be a worthwhile expense.  Saving for retirement  When you are feeling established as an independent contractor, consider starting a retirement account. Self-employed people have some unique options when it comes to retirement savings that aren’t available to employees. A SEP-IRA is one option. It allows self-employed people to set aside significantly more than in other accounts, providing you with deductions on your tax return while building your retirement savings. It’s wise to consult a financial planning professional before making investment decisions. I would recommend a  fee-only advisor  (who is compensated directly by you for advice).  More resources for independent contractors  For more information, the IRS has online tax centers on its website for  small businesses and the self-employed  and  those working in the gig economy .

{"prompt":"Do you recommend credit consolidation?","completion":" Do you recommend credit consolidation to improve scores and decrease debt?  Submitted by Natasha P.  There are two parts to this question, so let’s dig into them separately.  Improving Your Credit Score  Whenever a financial institution pulls your credit with the purpose of offering you a loan, your score may be affected. Closing a credit line, especially a well-established line, can also impact your score.  If you are consolidating a lot of credit cards or other debt into one or a couple of lines it can become more manageable and easier to not miss a payment, possibly improving your score. However, you could end up with a higher interest rate and the terms of consolidation often require you to close the other accounts. You can see that there are several things to consider.  Decreasing Your Debt  As for consolidating debt to decrease debt, consolidation doesn’t make the amount you owe disappear. It may make it more manageable to pay off depending on your budget, interest rate, and what your monthly payment would be. I’d first take a look at your spending habits, create a budget, and see where you could possibly bring in more money to help pay off the debt. If the habits that got you into racking up this debt are still in place, you’d be hard-pressed to see much change with or without debt consolidation.  If you do decide to consolidate debt, you’ll want to take three factors into consideration:  What is your primary objective?  Do you want to lower your interest rates overall, lower your monthly payments, or minimize the number of open accounts? Of course, the lower the rate, the less money you will pay in interest over the life of the loan. Most loans with collateral (ex. car, house, or savings account) will have a lower interest rate than unsecured loans. How much can you pay per month?  The more you can afford, the quicker the loan is paid, and less interest will accrue. What is your time frame to get out of debt?  By reorganizing debt and changing the type of debt and how much you owe per month, you can free up funds in your budget to pay off all of your debts quicker and maybe even jumpstart your savings.  Every situation is unique and debt consolidation is not always the right choice. Credit unions are my favorite resource for consolidation loans. By evaluating your current spending habits and considering the three questions mentioned above, you can come to the decision that will be best for you. "} 
{"prompt":"How do you get out of an upside down car loan?","completion":" How do you get out of an upside down car loan when you have bad credit and no one is willing to refinance?  Submitted by Nichole B.  You have touched on a hot button for me! In the early 90s, I had a car that was so upside down my grandchildren would be paying the loan. I’d had a few years of no income while I was in school and my credit was trashed.  The fact is, there are no great options. Once there is negative equity (meaning you loan is more than the value of your car) on a vehicle, it doesn’t go away.   Option 1: Ride It Out  For the most part, you will have to tough it out until you can pay the car down enough to get rid of the negative equity. Once you pay the car down, it will be much easier to find a lender who is willing to refinance, hopefully at a lower interest rate.  Option 2: Trade in the Car  The other option would be to trade in the car for a different vehicle. This option, more often than not, can create even more negative equity (making you more upside down), so you have to be patient. Choose a car that will outlast the new loan and find a “smokin’ deal.” This is most commonly called a “rollover” and your lender may be able to lower your interest rate/ monthly payment. You’ll still be on the hook for what you owed in the previous loan because the old loan is “rolled” into the new loan.  Here’s the bright side. I found a deal on a car that I could count on for years to come. I bought that new car and my interest rate was outrageous. The price was nearly twice the amount the car would cost if I wasn’t upside down. In two years, I refinanced with a credit union (yep… you know me!) and got a great rate. I paid off that car and am still driving it today.  In the short run, that was a very painful financial situation that I turned into a good situation. My car has more than 350,000 miles on it and I haven’t paid a car note in 10 years.  Financial mistakes are not fatal.  Learn the lesson and make choices that are in alignment with your long term goals.  Photo by  Peter Fazekas  from  Pexels "} 
{"prompt":"Saving for College","completion":"   Graduation celebrations are all around us. I think this is a wonderful time to think about what college savings means in your life and for your family.  Find your “why”  As exciting as college can be, the financial burden is often high. So take some time now to think about your motivations. Are you saving for your own education, or for a child or grandchild? What are your long-term goals (for yourself or others) and how does college fit in? These questions may seem obvious, but thinking about them ahead of time will help you motivate yourself as well as choose the right college and field of study.  How much time do you have?  Saving for the future begins with the  time horizon , which is the amount of time you have to save. Over this period of time, you’ll be adding to your savings, but that money should also be working as hard as you are by earning interest on what you put in.  Your time horizon can help you determine what approach you should take to investing. Do you want to be conservative, moderate, or aggressive in your investments? For example, if you’re saving for your 5-year-old to go to college, you can be more aggressive with your investments than if you were saving for a 15-year-old to go to college.  How does saving fit into your plan to pay for college?  Paying for college entirely with savings would be great, but the reality is that most people use a combination of sources to pay for college, including savings, private student loans, federal student loans, scholarships, and grants. There are lots of options and you can potentially avoid a lot of debt through  a combination of other sources .  Now, how are you going to make it happen?  Even if your priority is saving for college, you’ll always have competing financial needs, including an emergency fund, expenses, and other goals. So now you need to figure out how your budget can support your priorities.   Create a budget and determine how much you can set aside consistently  Decide which type of account you want to save in. A few options are 529 accounts (Children’s Savings Accounts), Roth (retirement), or regular savings. Each option has strengths and weaknesses.  Save, monitor, and evaluate your progress regularly.   For a deeper dive into planning for college, check out these resources:   The U.S. Department of Education’s  College Preparation Checklist  The U.S. Department of Education’s  Elementary School Checklist  (it’s never too early to start planning!)

{"prompt":"Where Do You Apply for a Marketplace Plan?","completion":" There are several ways you can apply for a  Marketplace  health insurance plan. During Open Enrollment, you can shop, compare, and apply directly through  HealthCare.gov . However, some states have created their own “State Based Marketplace” or “exchange.” If you live in  a state that runs their own Marketplace , you can enroll directly through their site.  You can also enroll through a secure and trusted partner of HealthCare.gov, like  HealthSherpa . HealthSherpa offers the same plans and prices with no extra costs. Plus, HealthSherpa was the very first company approved to have the entire enrollment experience on their own site. It makes the enrollment process much easier and more streamlined for anyone looking to shop for an Obamacare plan. If you want extra help, the HealthSherpa Consumer Advocate team can walk you through the process over the phone.  If you don’t have access to a phone or computer, you can submit a paper application. You’ll receive your eligibility results in up to two weeks, and then begin your enrollment process.  Don’t forget that not everyone who sells health insurance online offers Marketplace insurance. So if you choose to buy your insurance online but not through HealthCare.gov, make sure you use a trusted partner like HealthSherpa to ensure that you are buying a Marketplace plan. Some sellers might only offer short-term plans that come with low premiums, and also cover very little in terms of preventive care, pre-existing conditions, and the kinds of essential health benefits guaranteed by Marketplace plans.

{"prompt":"What You Need to Know about Unemployment Benefits","completion":"If you lose your job, there are resources out there to help you stay afloat financially as you plan your next steps forward.  Eligibility and Applications  Unemployment benefits and eligibility requirements vary state-to-state, so  choose your state  to start the process of checking your eligibility and applying for benefits. Generally, unemployment benefits are available to workers who become unemployed “through no fault of their own” – which means that you may not be eligible if you were fired for cause or if you quit your job.  Other Related Benefits  Unemployment insurance is just one of the  benefits that you may be eligible for . To continue your group health insurance after leaving a job, you can enroll in COBRA continuation coverage. And if illness or injury prevents you from working, you can apply for short-term or long-term disability insurance.  Should I Apply?  If you believe you are eligible for unemployment benefits, but feel reluctant to apply, I encourage you to think about why you feel this way. Are you holding shame about being unemployed? It may be helpful to talk to someone you trust who can support you in applying for the benefits you’re eligible to receive.  Take Action Now  Losing a job is a big event, and you may feel frightened or uncertain about the future. Acknowledge and deal with the emotions you’re experiencing. If you need support, talk to a trusted friend.  As you figure out your next steps forward, address your budget now and make any necessary changes. Pay for necessities and contact your creditors if you need to.  Don’t agree to pay more than you can afford  and  seek out any public benefits  that you’re eligible for.  If you believe you are eligible for a benefit, be prepared to challenge if your claim is rejected.  Plan Your Transition  We all have transitions, so take this time to consider your vision for the next three months, six months, and beyond. What milestones do you hope to accomplish at these intervals?  Here are a few more questions I want you to think through:   What job-seeking requirements must you fulfill to be eligible for unemployment benefits?  What information or resources do you need?  How will you stay motivated through this transition period?  What will you do if or when you are no longer eligible for benefits?   Remember that bumps along your professional journey are seldom your final destination. Set realistic expectations for yourself given the economic and unemployment conditions in your geographic area and field. Then get the support you need and keep yourself on track. I’m rooting for you! "} 
{"prompt":"What is the Standard Deduction?","completion":" The standard deduction is the amount of income you get to deduct from your total taxable income. Because the standard deduction lowers your taxable income, it means you pay less income tax.   In 2019, the standard deduction for someone filing as single is $12,200. For a Head of Household, the standard deduction is $18,350. And for married couples, the standard deduction is $24,400.  For example, let’s say you are single, and in 2019 your total taxable, earned income was $48,000. That is the amount your employer will report to the IRS.   When you file your taxes, you report the same amount, but then you get to deduct $12,200 from the $48,000. Now the amount you pay taxes on is $35,800. You would go to the IRS tax table for the year 2019 (this table is currently still a draft on the IRS website) and it will tell you that in 2019, the total tax due on $35,800 (your new taxable income amount) is $4,129.00. If you didn’t have the standard deduction, the total tax due on $48,000 would have been $6,424.    Because of the standard deduction, your tax liability decreased by $2,295.

This year especially brings a lot of uncertainty with new tax regulations.  Here are a few things you can do now to make tax season a breeze.  Check how changes in tax laws will affect you  Tax law changes frequently, and this past year brought a lot of big changes. Before you panic, know the facts and how they affect you.  This article  is a good place to start. There’s a lot of detail, so focus your attention on these issues that I pulled from the article and the IRS website because I want your life to be easier (you’re welcome):   Reduced tax rates – The 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered U.S. tax rates. While the number of tax brackets remained at seven, the rates were lowered and the income thresholds were increased (mostly for high income earners).  Taxpayers can choose between using the standard deduction or itemized deductions. Itemizing deductions means adding up all of the individual tax deductions to which you’re entitled and then subtracting them from your adjusted gross income (AGI). (Note: Adjusted gross income is your total income minus a few adjustments. Common adjustments to income include traditional IRA contributions and student loan interest, just to name a few.)  Elimination of personal exemptions – this makes me sad, but we will see what happens with these changes:  Increased standard deductions: $12,000 for singles, $18,000 for heads of households and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly  Increased child tax credit: $2,000 per qualifying child and a new $500 credit for other qualifying dependents  Changes to itemized deductions     The  IRS website has a calculator  so you can do a “paycheck check up” to see if you are withholding the right amount for your situation. That won’t help much for this year but you can get a jump on next year planning by checking out your withholding on your W-4 (yes, you can change it).  Reach out for reliable help  Each person and situation is different, so if you have questions, you may need to consult a professional to find the answer.

{"prompt":"How can I save on a fixed income and disability?","completion":" The key to saving is quite simply, to spend less than you make. This works for all incomes, whether it’s from a job, retirement, or government benefits like disability.  If you are spending everything that you have each month, then consider checking your spending for a leak in your wallet. When I say “leak,” I mean those little things you occasionally buy, that you justify because “it’s just a few bucks.”  Start by going to your bank account and get a 30-day history. Every time money came out of your account, put it under its specific category. You will have food, eating out, and gas, just to name a few. Once you have done this for the entire 30 days, add up each category. Is there one that surprised you? Does your spending match what is on your budget sheet?    If not, you have some changes to make. But now that you know where your leak is, you can fix it. Instead of buying a coffee every day, make your own. Maybe you could set up a car pool if your gas is more than you thought. Is the eating out category too high? Make more meals at home. Whatever your leak is, start to make changes to plug it, and start putting the extra money into your savings.  Even if its only $5 a week, that $5 will make a difference. Before you know it, that small savings will grow to be $100, and then $200. Every time you spend money, ask yourself, “Is this necessary or could I be putting this money into my savings account?” Those little savings will add up just as quickly as those little purchases will. The difference is, one works for you and one works against you.   "} 
{"prompt":"“Pay Yourself First” – Your Savings Mantra","completion":"Focus on You. Pay Yourself First.  Have you ever thought, “I’ll pay all of my bills and save what’s left”? Well, how much was left? When we wait to save until the end of the month, we usually learn that we have more month than money and there is nothing left. We challenge you to commit to paying yourself first.  “Pay yourself first.” We hear it all the time, but what does it really mean? Most of us have thought about saving more or saving more regularly, but how many of us really save before paying our bills?  A Habit of Saving  Paying yourself first means that before you pay anyone else, including essential living expenses, put money in your savings account. This really is the “golden rule” of personal finance.  The amount you save isn’t as important as the habit you create.  The Power of Automatic Transfers  Make saving your priority by setting up an automatic transfer each month.

{"prompt":"How do tax write-offs work?","completion":" We all know the saying: “There are two certainties in life: death and taxes.” Since taxes are one of our largest ongoing expenses, we’re all interested in keeping them as low as possible. Fortunately, the government has created tax breaks in order to incentive citizens to do things it considers valuable to society.  For example, the government wants people to buy homes, have children, donate to charity, and start businesses. Thus, the government established the mortgage interest deduction, child tax credit, and charitable deduction, and all business expenses are deductible against business income.  It’s important to be aware of these tax benefits when making decisions. Any money that doesn’t go to taxes can be put toward your other financial goals.  How tax deductions work  You can subtract tax deductible expenses from your taxable income. Since your taxable income is lower, you could pay less taxes.  Let’s assume a married couple is in the 12%  tax bracket  (combined income between $19,750 and $80,250). A $1,000 tax-deductible expense would lower their taxable income by $1,000. Since the couple wouldn’t owe taxes on that $1,000 of income, they would save $120 in taxes (12% of $1,000) that they otherwise would have owed.  It’s important to understand that tax deductions lower your taxable income,  not  taxes owed. Have you heard anyone say, “It’s okay if I spend that money because I can write it off on my taxes”? Some people treat tax deductions as if they are getting their money back. A more accurate way to look at a tax-deductible expense is that the government provides a percentage subsidy of that expense equaling your marginal tax rate.  So in the case of this example couple, the government subsidized 12% of that $1,000 expense and the couple’s taxes were lowered by $120 (12% of $1,000). Not bad, but not the same as a 100% subsidy.    Tax deductions vs. tax credits  Unlike tax deductions, tax credits decrease taxes owed dollar-for-dollar. For instance, if that same married couple above had a child, they could claim the  child tax credit  ($2,000 per child). Let’s say they had a combined taxable income of $60,000 and would ordinarily owe $7,000 in federal income taxes. The child tax credit would lower their tax owed to $5,000.  So which is better, tax deductions or tax credits? It depends on your tax bracket. Taxpayers in lower brackets often benefit more from tax credits, while taxpayers in higher brackets tend to benefit more from tax deductions. For instance, our example couple would need $16,667 in tax deductions to save $2,000 in taxes (12% of $16,667 = $2,000). Let’s compare that to another couple earning $350,000, putting them in the 32% bracket. That couple would only need $6,250 in tax deductions to save $2,000 in taxes (32% of $6,250 = $2,000).   Standard deduction, itemized deductions, and above-the-line deductions  Since the new tax bill passed, it’s even more important to pay attention to whether you itemize deductions or take the  standard deduction . The IRS grants every taxpayer a no-questions-asked standard deduction amount. You can either claim the standard deduction or itemize your deductions and claim that amount. You cannot do both. After adding up your deductible expenses for the year, if that total is larger than the standard deduction, it makes sense to itemize. If your total itemized deductions are lower than the standard deduction, then you should take the standard deduction.  The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) doubled the standard deduction. It is now  $12,400 for single taxpayers and $24,800 for married couples . After this change, a lot of taxpayers who usually itemized have found that it’s no longer in their interests. An estimated  13.7% of taxpayers  will itemize in 2019 compared to 31.1% if pre-TCJA law were still in effect. This means you may no longer be getting tax benefits from some of your expenses, which increases the real cost of those expenses to you.  Lastly,  above-the-line deductions  can be used whether you itemize or not, so they are very valuable.  Using this knowledge throughout the year  When you understand how tax deductions work, you can think about them not just at tax time, but also proactively. You can think about how the decisions you make today will impact your future tax bill.  For instance, in 2025, the standard deduction amounts are set to return to where they were before (essentially cut in half). Today’s larger standard deduction has caused some of you to start claiming that when you previously itemized. In that case, it could make sense to delay 2024 deductible expenses ( medical bills or charitable donations) into 2025. You will likely claim the larger TCJA standard deduction in 2024 either way, so those expenses provide no tax benefits. Spending that money in 2025 would provide additional deductions, because you would likely be back to itemizing after the standard deduction goes back down.  "} 
{"prompt":"How can you balance saving with the asset limits on federal and state benefits?","completion":"“How can you help people who are going to get bumped off their subsidized food and housing because they have assets? Then the federal and state agencies say ‘Hey, all is well now.” They may be making more, but not enough yet to sustain themselves, landing them right back in poverty. I’ve seen this happen to one woman who was told she had to work after a certain number of months. So, she did. Then she no longer qualified for the apartment she was in. She got a roomie for her new place. But that income in her house meant she no longer qualified for food stamps. She did what she was supposed to do and now her life is no better and, in fact, worse. So, if you have savings, it can hurt you. It’s not right, but that’s the way it is.”  Submitted by Jody L.  What you are describing is called “asset means testing.” You’ve touched on a hot topic for those of us in the business of helping people save money. Your story describes the situation that many people are facing if they receive public benefits and try to increase their income or save for emergencies.  What are Asset Limits?  Asset limits determine a person’s eligibility for public benefits programs. This is a very complex topic, so let’s start with this overview from  Prosperity Now , a nonprofit agency that focuses on the policy solutions that affect poverty:  “Many public benefit programs—such as cash welfare, food assistance and heating assistance—limit eligibility to those with few or no assets. If individuals or families have assets exceeding the state’s limit, they must “spend down” longer-term savings in order to receive what is often short-term public assistance. These asset limits, which were originally created to ensure that public resources did not go to “asset-rich” individuals, are a relic of entitlement policies that in some cases no longer exist. Cash welfare programs, for example, now focus on quickly moving individuals and families to self-sufficiency, rather than allowing them to receive benefits indefinitely. Personal savings and assets are precisely the kinds of resources that allow people to move off public benefit programs. Yet, asset limits can discourage anyone considering or receiving public benefits from saving for the future.”  We certainly don’t want people to take advantage of programs that are intended for those experiencing poverty. But as you noticed, this often becomes a “catch-22” if you are trying to work your way out of poverty.  How to Save While Receiving Benefits  So, what can you do to better your financial life if you are on public benefits?   Find a local nonprofit agency that understands asset limits and helps people manage the paradox of building financial security while on public benefits.  Know the asset limits in your state and for the benefits you are receiving. This doesn’t mean you can’t save. You just want to make sure that you don’t do harm to your overall financial situation.  There are a growing number of accounts that are not included in asset means testing. But be sure to check each type of account and the relevant benefits. See this  overview of SNAP  for an example.  Be mindful of any financial choices that impact your benefits. This is not to say that you should not take a job that moves you towards your goal. However, if a job doesn’t provide benefits (especially medical) and doesn’t pay well enough for you to manage without benefits, this may be an indicator that you should keep looking until you find employment that meets your needs.   The good news is that there are many organizations and people in the trenches fighting too. In some states, the efforts to repeal the means test is working. Prosperity Now has a  Scorecard  that tracks how states are doing regarding public benefits and asset limits. Check out your state and ways you can get involved if this issue is a hot topic for you too! "} 
{"prompt":"How Can I Get Started with Low-Risk Investments?","completion":" How do I begin with low risk investments? For example CD’s, money market accounts, etc.  Submitted by Deirel M.  First of all, way to go!  Investing  is all about preparing for your future and the fact that you’re clear that you want low risk is an appropriate first step.  Are You Ready to Start Investing?  How you begin depends on where you are in your investing journey. How much have you set aside to invest? Have you established an emergency fund to make sure you don’t need the money before a CD matures?  Let’s talk about certificates of deposit and money market accounts first.   What is a Certificate of Deposit?  Most certificates of deposit (CDs) require a minimum deposit to open. With a CD, you can’t add to the balance and you can’t change the term. Your rate of return is set for that period regardless of how the market fluctuates. If you withdraw the funds before it reaches maturity, you often pay fees and penalties. CDs have a wide variety of term (30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or even years) and, generally, the longer the term of CD, the better the interest rate.  What is a Money Market Account?  Money market accounts  (MMA) require a larger deposit to open compared a regular savings account and usually have limits on the number of withdrawals you can make in a month. Unlike a regular checking account, a MMA is an interest-earning account.  How to Get Started  So, now you know about the tools. What now?  If you’re starting out with no savings at all, one of the first things you can do is have a set dollar amount or percentage of your paycheck direct deposited to a savings account. If you can have it at a bank not connected to your checking account, that’s a bonus. Out of sight, out of mind. That can keep you from being tempted to make withdrawals (this is future money, right?). Once you have your desired amount, you can check with where the best rates for CD’s and money market accounts with  Bankrate  or check with your bank for their latest promotion.  If you aren’t quite ready to plunk down a large sum that you don’t touch, you can also explore other low-risk investments like savings bonds and high-yield savings accounts. With these, you can start with as little as $50-$100.  Check out more tips on investing:  Investing 101: Stocks, Bonds, and More When Should I Start Investing? "} 
{"prompt":"Thinking about Investing? Investment-Savvy Checklist","completion":"A lot of members tell us they’re interested in investing. Maybe you’re starting to save regularly, and you’re wondering how your money can work for you instead of  sitting passively in a bank account .  What Are Your Goals?  Before jumping into investment strategies, start with this basic question: what is the point of investing to you?  If your answer is something like, “I want to make oodles of money,” I suggest getting more specific and more realistic. If you expect to make a lot of money from an investment, this may cause you to take unnecessary (or unwise) risks to chase huge returns.  Instead, use your short, intermediate, and long-term targets and financial goals to inform your investment decisions.  How Much Can You Safely Invest?  Before thinking about your future self, make sure you’re taking care of your immediate needs. Your emergency fund and debt management should still be priorities. Make sure you have a sustainable plan for your daily money management. Investing has risk involved, so don’t count on that money being available in an emergency.  Beyond making sure you have enough saved for emergencies, think about how much you feel comfortable investing.  Assess your risk tolerance  – whether you’re comfortable with high-risk (potentially high-reward or high-loss) investments.  How Much Effort Do You Want to Put Into Investing?  There are so many options out there. Ask yourself how hard you want to work at maintaining your investment portfolio. Do you want to do lots of research and actively manage all your money, or do you want to let a service or professional manage your investments for you?  If you’re interested in a DIY approach,  do your research first . One option is to start small, perhaps with an app that allows you to manage relatively small investments (for example,  Acorns  or  Robinhood ).  If you’d prefer to leave your money to an expert, I caution you to  know your expert .  Start, Monitor, and Adjust  As with all your financial decisions, check in regularly to see if you’re happy with the results. If you’re not, review what you have done, take a good look at the outcome, and make adjustments if necessary.  One way to know if your investment plan is working for you is to do what we call “the pillow test.” It’s pretty easy. If your investments are causing you to lose sleep, you need a better plan – and don’t be afraid to get help. Your investment plan should be working  for  you, not causing you stress.

{"prompt":"How Do You Improve Your Credit Score?","completion":"    Sign up for SaverLife  to earn points and chances to win cash prizes when you read articles like this!  There are many things you can do to level up your finances. One area you can focus on that will help across the board is to improve your credit score. Having a good credit score saves you money and gives you more options. It can help you get better loan interest rates and pay less for insurance. It can also give you more housing options, the ability to rent without a cosigner, and you can sometimes even get security deposits for things like utilities waived. But where do you start?  Here are six things to work on if you want to improve your credit score.  1. Pay Your Bills on Time  Paying your bills on time is a huge way to improve your credit score. Keeping up with your monthly payments shows lenders that you are a good risk. It also demonstrates that you manage your money well and don’t overextend yourself. In the FICO Credit Scoring system, payment history accounts for 35% of your overall credit score. So, paying your bills on time can have a big impact as you work to improve your credit score.  2. Have a Credit Card  Credit is one of those things that you can’t build unless you have it. The easiest way to  establish credit  is to get a credit card and use it responsibly. Fifteen percent of your FICO credit score comes from your overall length of credit history. Getting a credit card and making on-time payments can improve your credit score.  3. Keep Your Account Usage Low  Another thing you can do to improve your credit is keep your credit utilization low. When lenders and credit card companies look at your credit utilization ratio, they look at how much of your available credit you are using. To do this, they compare your total outstanding balances across all your cards to your total available credit. Ideally, you want to keep this ratio below 30%.    That means if you have one credit card with a limit of $1,000, you don’t want to carry an outstanding balance of more than $300. The best way to keep this ratio low is to pick a few expenses you’ve budgeted for each month, charge them to your credit card, and then pay the balance in full each month. This allows you to keep your credit usage low.  4. Don’t Default on Loans  Just as paying your bills on time helps your credit score, so does paying your loans and not defaulting on them. Defaulting on a loan can stay on your credit report for 7-10 years. Sometimes a default occurs after the first missed payment. It can also occur after several missed payments, depending on the terms of the loan. These missed payments will negatively impact your credit score. So, keeping up with your loan payments will help you improve your credit score.  5. Have a Good Credit Mix  When building and improving your credit score, it’s important to maintain a good mixture of credit. This means that you want to have both installment credit (loans) and revolving credit (credit cards or charge accounts). Your credit mix accounts for 10% of your FICO score. It indicates to potential lenders how well you manage your money and whether or not you can meet your monthly financial obligations. While it is good to have a mix of credit, be sure to only borrow or charge what you can afford to pay back.  6. Open New Credit Sparingly  Another thing that can help improve your credit score is only opening new credit when you need it. This can help you avoid opening several new accounts all at once. Opening too many new accounts in a short period of time can lower your credit score and can also make you look like a risky borrower. Open new credit only when you need it and be sure to factor repayments into your budget.  Final Thoughts  Improving your credit score takes time, persistence, and patience. But it is possible! Be sure you understand what determines your credit score, know how your actions affect it, and recognize what you can do to change it. If you use your credit mindfully, pay your bills on time, and don’t spend more than you can afford to pay off, over time you will see your credit score improve. This will give you more opportunities and access to better interest rates as you move forward.

{"prompt":"6 Steps to Create the Perfect Budget","completion":" The key to creating a budget is finding what works to help you manage your money. Many budgeting tools exist, but you need to find what works for you. Managing your money is about choices – choosing how to earn, spend, save, and keep track of your money. A personalized, realistic budget can help you set priorities, direct spending, and manage your cash flow. While budgeting tools and practices vary from person to person, there are generally six steps that most people take to create a budget. Keep in mind, it is really more of an art than a science.  Step 1: Explore your goals and values  What’s important to you? What is your top financial or life goal? If you need some help, identifying your goals, use  this worksheet . Your goals will help you create a budget that affords your current obligations, activities you enjoy, and future plans.  Step 2: Gather and track your financial information  You need to understand what is happening now with your money, including income, expenses, and savings. What is coming in? What’s going out? What’s stored away? Most people know their regular earnings and expenses, but may not have a clear picture of irregular or day-to-day expenditures. To get a better sense of your cash flow, carefully track your income and expenses for at least 30 days.  Determining your income – the money you and your family receive on a regular basis from work, investments, public benefits, or business sales – might be relatively easy. For budgeting purposes, use your net (or take-home) monthly income after taxes and other payroll deductions have been taken out. Collect information related to income, such as paystubs, that show how much you bring in and how often from all sources. Calculate your total. If you prefer,  use a worksheet  to make sure you’re capturing everything.  Gathering expenses – anything you spend your money on – can be more involved. You have some expenses that are fixed and regular, such as rent, and others that change day-to-day, such as groceries or entertainment. To closely track all expenses for at least 30 days, you can gather monthly bills, collect receipts, use a notebook,  use a worksheet , use an online budgeting tool, and/or review your bank and credit card statements. Choose the method that works best for you. For irregular, expected expenses, such as car maintenance, an insurance premium, or car registration, gather past information or make estimates. After 30 days, gather all of your expense records (bills, receipts, bank statements, notebooks), categorize (housing expenses, food expenses), and then add up your total monthly expenses.  Also, note how much you already have set aside by checking your savings balance.  Step 3: Assess your current financial situation  What’s your bottom line? After you have all of your financial information in order, subtract your expenses from your monthly income to see what is left over (also known as your bottom line) to spend or save. If it’s helpful,  use a worksheet . In some cases, your bottom line might be negative, meaning that you are spending more than your current income. Consider what immediate changes you can make to bring in more, spend less, or do both.  If you have some money left over each month, consider whether it’s enough to cover essentials, money set aside for emergencies, your financial goals, and expenses that are important for you, such as fitness or entertainment. If not (and that is usually the case), you’ll have to make some changes to current spending, saving, and earning habits. Nearly always, reaching financial goals requires us to change our financial habits. How much exactly do you need to set aside each month to be on track with your current situation and future plans?  Step 4: Make changes to how you manage your money  From your assessment, you have a dollar amount in mind of how much you need to adjust your current financial habits. To change your bottom line, there are only three changes you can make: increase your income, spend less, or do both. Bringing in more income could include turning a hobby into a business or second job, maximizing your tax benefits, accessing public benefits, or selling items you do not use.  For reducing expenses, move from general to specific changes. First, note your essentials and priorities. You can use a  tool to prioritize . Then, think about your least important expenses. What costs too much? What could you change? Spend some time looking at the big picture. Brainstorm, and get creative. After that, go through specific spending categories, such as transportation or insurance, and consider changes. Could you carpool or take public transportation more often to save on gas? Could you shop around for a lower cost insurance plan? Keep drilling down until your expenses are where you need them to be. Then integrate the changes into your budget.  Step 5: Create your budget  By now, you’ve done all of the hard work. You have gathered your income and expenses, and you have made changes to habits. It’s time to commit to your new plan by putting it in writing. To make your written budget, you can use  a worksheet , an app, a spreadsheet, or a notebook.  It is important that you find a tool that works for you to map out your new plan for saving and spending.  Step 6: Follow, track, and adjust as needed  Follow your plan as best you can and continue to track what you actually spend using a record-keeping system that works for you. At least every month, reconcile your planned budget versus your actual expenses. Your findings may help guide you to adjust your budget or your spending habits. Remember, a budget is your plan to manage your money in ways that work for you! "}

If you’re not sure if you’re living beyond your means, check out my recent article where I help you  figure out if you need to make some changes .  Here are some solutions to help you live within your means and improve your financial situation:  1. Track Your Spending  It’s easy to lose track of what you spend, especially when you use credit cards, debit cards, and automatic bill pay. While those methods are convenient, they hinder our ability to determine how much we are actually spending. Ideally, you should track your spending for 30 days. Track every penny so that you can get an accurate accounting of where your money is going. Tracking how you spend your money over a 30-day period is useful for creating an accurate spending plan.  2. Create a Spending Plan  A spending plan is a great way to evaluate your income and expenses. To create an effective spending plan, you must be honest about your spending habits. Look for ways to reduce expenses and/or increase income.  Read more about creating the perfect budget for you.  3. Set Up Your Emergency Fund Before Paying Your Debt  You need to be prepared for emergencies. If you are using all of your extra income to pay down debt and an emergency occurs, you will end up taking on more debt, the exact opposite of what you want. I recommend saving between 5% – 10% of your net (take home) pay before you put extra money towards debt.  4. Pay Off Credit and Loans Using the Snowball Method  This snowball method is relatively simple and psychologically satisfying.  You pay off the smaller debt first and make your way up to the larger debts. This method may not be the most cost-effective, but it helps motivate you towards debt freedom as you feel accomplished every time you eliminate debt.   Note that you should typically pay off high-interest debt first. Credit cards are usually a great place to start due to their high-interest rates. If you’re highly motivated, I recommend starting with high-interest debt and working your way down. This is called the  avalanche method .   5. Use Cash  Using cash is a great way to stick to your budget. Why? You can only spend as much as you have. Swiping a credit card is easy, but limiting yourself to a specific amount of cash is an effective way to get your spending habits in line with your spending goals.  With hard work and commitment, you can  live debt-free ! "} 
{"prompt":"How to Get the Best Rate on a Loan","completion":"If you need money for the short or long term, it’s important to remember that not all loans are created equal – and the price you pay for that money (in fees and interest) may vary dramatically.  What do you need?  Before shopping around for loans, you should know how much money you’re looking to borrow! You’ll want to make sure you’re only borrowing what you need. If you’re clear on how much you actually need, you won’t feel as tempted to accept an offer that is beyond your needs.  I learned this the hard way. When I was in college, I was approved for a loan that was much larger than I needed to pay my expenses. The idea of all that extra money was so enticing that I didn’t think about the long-term impacts of taking more money than I needed. But those loans haunted me during repayment. Ultimately, I had to remember the “no shame zone” and forgive myself.  Before  you apply for a loan, consider how much time you’ll need to repay the loan as well as well as what your repayment plan will be.  What’s your credit score?  When you apply for a loan, the lender will run a credit check. But if you know your score ahead of time, you’ll know what to expect going in to the conversation. If you know that your credit score is low, consider improving your credit before applying so that you can get a lower interest rate. This might be tough if you need the money soon, but talk to a  reputable credit counselor  to learn about your options.  If your credit score isn’t as high as you’d like it to be, you could ask someone to cosign the loan with you to get a better rate. Check that the person cosigning your loan has a better credit score than yours, and make sure you don’t make any late payments, because that will harm your cosigner.  What are your options?  I recommend getting multiple loan offers so that you can compare the terms and make sure you’re getting the best deal. But beware! Shopping around for a loan can impact your credit. The good news is that  FICO Scores  understand that people may request loans from multiple companies even if they’re only looking for one. FICO will ignore mortgage, auto, and student loan inquiries made in the 30 days prior to scoring.  Once you have multiple options,  evaluate them  based on the terms, interest rates, payments, and the  total  interest that you’ll pay over the course of the loan. Many lenders will try to get you to focus on the payment. That is certainly a factor you should consider, but it’s not the most important factor.  Where are your limits?  Be honest with yourself. If you don’t have a budget already, work out how you will handle the payments and make sure you know how you’ll fit this new debt into your financial plan. "}

{"prompt":"Should I Open a Savings Account for My Kids?","completion":" Before opening a savings account, think about why you and your child are saving money. Here are some common reasons  Pay for  future education expenses Help your child manage the money they make from their job  Give your child a lump sum of money when they graduate from high school  Your reason for saving the money will help you decide where to save the money. There are three main options that may be a good fit for you  529 College Savings Account  If you’re saving money for educational expenses, consider an education savings account, like a 529 plan. A 529 is a savings account specifically for educational expenses. You can invest the money you put into a 529 plan. If you use the money for a  qualified educational  cost, then all of the money is typically tax-free. Depending on the state you live in, the amount you put into the 529 plan may be state tax-deductible. You also maintain control over the account.  Benefits of a 529 Account  The money gets special tax treatment by the IRS 529 plans owned by custodial parents generally don’t heavily impact your child’s financial aid eligibility  Downsides of a 529 Account  You are limited to using the funds for education-related expenses You are limited in what you can invest inside a 529 plan  If you want the flexibility to use the money for anything, then a savings account may be a better fit.  Joint Bank Account with Your Child  These accounts typically require you to open the account with your kids. Both you and your child will own the account. This option gives you the ability to manage the account until your child is mature enough to handle the account alone. Your child can use the funds in the account generally at any time for any reason. A joint account may be an option for a parent with a working child who wants to both save and spend the money in the account.   Benefits of a Joint Bank Account  Joint ownership so you can manage the account The child has access to the account   Downsides of a Joint Bank Account  You’re responsible for what your child does in the account Possible financial aid eligibility impact  UTMA/UGMA Custodial Accounts  The Uniform Transfers To Minors Act (UTMA) allows you to put more assets into the account, like real estate. The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) limits what you can put into the account to mostly cash and investments like stocks and bonds. The account is managed by an adult on behalf of a minor. The minor doesn’t have access to the account until they are an adult. UTMA/UGMA may be a consideration if you want to save (or invest) money to give to your child once they are an adult.  Benefits of a UTMA/UGMA Custodial Account  Lots of investment options Can use the money for any purpose  Downsides of a UTMA/UGMA Custodial Account  At a certain age (can vary by state), the money belongs to the child Possible financial aid impact   To recap, before opening an account to save money for your child, decide the purpose of the savings. The purpose of the savings will help you decide what option is best for you and your child.  "}
