{"text": "What happens when an emergency is ongoing? My husband had a stroke, and a) can no longer work; and b) now has high medical bills. We're drowning financially, and it is going to be an ongoing issue.  Submitted by Amy A.  First, we are so sorry your family is going through this difficult time. The first step is applying for benefits to provide some relief as you plan for a new financial reality. If you haven't already done so, start with the  Social Security Administration . This  checklist  can help you gather the information you need to get started.  Once you have taken this step, you can begin to look into other supports and resources:   Visit  211.org  or call 211 to find organizations near you that provide support.  Savings or other assets in excess of $2,000 can impact your eligibility for some benefits, so it may be advantageous to get the support of a financial coach to help you manage any existing resources in order to stabilize your housing and other necessities.  Visit the  CFPB website  or the  Financial Empowerment Center  network to see if there is a financial coach in your area. Seek coaching or counseling services from a reputable organization that provides services  at no cost to you .   This adjustment will be challenging so be prepared to take the first steps, then assess what you need going forward. It will be necessary to reframe your perspective from \u201cemergency\u201d to \u201cnew normal\u201d and take care of yourself during this process. You may have to make some difficult decisions around how to prioritize payments to creditors to ensure your situation doesn't get worse. This is where having an objective support system (a coach or counselor) can help you make the decisions that are best for your family in the long term.  Self care is crucial. There are many organizations that can provide emotional support (again, 211) as you rise up to the new challenges you are facing. We too are in your corner, wishing you and your husband the very best. '\""}
{"text": " When it comes to saving money, where you save it can be almost as important as saving it. There are many different savings options available today. One that is often talked about is the high-yield savings account (HYSA). But what is a high-yield savings account and when is it the best choice for your savings?  What is a High-Yield Savings Account?  A HYSA is a savings account that has a higher interest rate than a regular savings account. According to  Investopedia , HYSA interest rates are typically 20-25% higher than the interest rates of regular savings accounts. This higher interest rate allows you to earn more on your savings. Online banks typically offer the best rates on HYSAs. If you're considering opening a HYSA, it's important to understand the benefits as well as the downsides.  Benefits of a High-Yield Savings Account  One major benefit of a HYSA is that it allows you to earn more interest. This helps your money work harder for you and can help you reach your savings goals even faster.    Another thing that can be helpful for some people is that a HYSA allows you to separate out your savings. Because HYSAs are typically offered by internet-only banks, you often cannot open one at the same institution as your checking account. Having an account at another bank for your longer-term savings goals can help you separate these goals from your day-to-day finances. This separation can keep you on-task and ensure that your savings are used for your intended purpose.  Even with accounts at multiple banks, it is still easy to transfer funds. Typically, HYSAs at internet banks will allow for electronic funds transfers to and from your regular bank. This is helpful because it makes contributing to your HYSA easy. You can also often use the bank app to deposit checks into your HYSA. This access is helpful when your accounts are at different institutions.  Drawbacks of a High-Yield Savings Account  When considering a HYSA, it's important to also understand some of the drawbacks. Some HYSAs have more rules that regular savings accounts. They may require you to meet an initial minimum required deposit to open an account. When you are just starting to save money, this can create an unnecessary challenge. HYSAs also sometimes have account maintenance fees and other charges. These charges and fees may cancel out the benefits of the higher interest rate.    One big drawback of some HYSAs is the time that it can take to transfer funds from your savings to your everyday checking account so that you can use them. The time that these transfers take is heavily dependent on which banks you are transferring to and from. This is definitely a part of a HYSA that you'll want to understand when you open your new account.  It's important to note that like all savings accounts, HYSAs are subject to the banking regulation known as Regulation D. This limits certain types of transfers and withdrawals to and from the account to six per month. Make sure that you understand these limitations when moving money in and out of your savings accounts.  Final Thoughts on High-Yield Savings Accounts  Overall, the HYSA is becoming more common in the personal finance community. A higher interest rate can help your money work harder for you.   HYSAs are a good place to save for your bigger goals like buying a house, buying a car, or taking a trip. Depending on the transfer times for you to access your funds, a HYSA could also be a good place to save your emergency fund.  As with any financial product, when you think about opening a HYSA, be sure that you do your research. Find the best account for your particular situation that will work as an integrated piece of your financial plan.  Consider the fees, minimum required deposit, and whether you need access to a debit card or ATM for the account as you pick which institution to use.  A high-yield savings account offers you a great savings opportunity with a higher interest rate. It might fit in well with the rest of your personal financial plan! '\""}
{"text": " The  Earned Income Tax Credit  (EITC or EIC) is a benefit for working people with low to moderate income. To qualify, you must meet certain requirements. You must also file a tax return even if you don't owe any taxes or are not required to file. The EITC reduces the taxes you owe and may even give you a refund.  EITC Requirements  There are certain requirements you must meet in order to be eligible for the EITC. You must have earned income, whether it's from working for someone or running your own business. You must also meet some additional requirements.  If you are claiming a child, your child must meet all the qualifying child rules for you (or your spouse if you file a joint return).  If you do not claim a child that qualifies you for the credit, you must meet these rules:  You must have resided in the US for more than 6 months No one else can claim you as a dependent on their tax return You must be between the ages of 25 and 65 at the end of the tax year  Income Limits for the EITC  There are limits on how much you can earn before you no longer qualify for the EITC. The number of children you are claiming will determine these limits.  For joint filers, the limit ranges from $21,370 (for couples who claim no children) to $55,952 (for couples with three or more children).   The credit can provide as much as $6,557 for 2019. If the credit is more than what you owe, it doesn't just bring your tax bill to zero. It means you get the difference as a refund. For example, if according to the standard tax rate your tax due was $550, but your Earned Income Credit was $1,550, you would get a refund of $1000.  If you aren't sure if you qualify for EITC, the IRS has a  publication to guide you through the process . '\""}
{"text": " If you're like most people, the word  stimulus  makes you perk up your ears these days. Perhaps you've either already received or eagerly await that much-needed payment, which will arrive by a deposit in your bank account, a check in the mail, or an  Economic Impact Payment Card .\\\\xa0  With the second stimulus bill now in action, let's make sure you get the stimulus money you're eligible for! The coverage can be confusing, so here are some key pieces of information you need to know.  An overview of the second stimulus payment  The U.S. government passed a second COVID-related stimulus bill in late December 2020, which included a second round of stimulus payments to U.S. residents who qualify. The standard amount of the payment is $600 per adult and $600 per child 16-years-old or younger. There is no limit on the number of children in a family who can receive the payment. So, for instance, a family of four can receive up to $2,400.  However, individuals and families phase out of the stimulus payment window once they reach a certain income. The limit to receive the full stimulus amount is:  $75,000 for a single person $112,500 for Head of Household $150,000 for Married Filing Jointly  In addition, depending on your income, you may not qualify for the full amount. To check your eligibility and amount, use the  IRS Get My Payment tool  or  this great tool from Kiplinger .  Note:  Mixed immigration status families can now receive stimulus payments! You should automatically receive both payments \u2014 the one from earlier this year as well as the most recent one. But if you don't get the payments, you need to file your taxes to receive them.  When should I expect my payment?  As of this writing, the IRS had distributed nearly  80 percent of payments . After Friday, January 15th, there will be no more payments for this round.\\\\xa0  The IRS is only able to distribute payments to people already in their system who they define as eligible. But part of that eligibility is based on how you filed 2019 taxes. If your status has changed, you may be owed a stimulus payment that you won't see until you file your 2020 taxes. More on that in a bit.\\\\xa0  Tip:  Did you know you can sign up to receive an email every day letting you know what mail is on the way with  Informed Delivery \u00ae  by USPS \u00ae ?\\\\xa0  Tip:  If you receive veterans' benefits or Social Security payments on your Direct Express card, you can also check the status of your payment  here  and learn more about receiving your payments.  What if I haven't received my stimulus payment?  If you received the first stimulus payment via check or debit card, make sure you check all your mail and don't throw anything away without opening it. Not all envelopes will be clearly marked.  Unfortunately, if you have moved since you received the first payment, there is no way to update your mailing address at this time. You must instead file your 2020 taxes to get the stimulus check.  Tip:  If you have moved, make sure to  update your address  for any future payments!\\\\xa0  If you received the first stimulus check via direct deposit, you should expect the second via direct deposit as well. But if you have since closed the bank account that the IRS has on file for you, there is no way to update this information at this time. Again, you must file your 2020 taxes to get the stimulus check.  Another wrinkle: During the first round of stimulus payments, if the IRS didn't have your information on file in order to send you a check, you were able to add it using their online too. Unfortunately, for this round, it's not an option.  Tip:  If the  IRS Get My Payment tool  gives you the message \u201cPayment Status #2 \u2013 Not Available,\u201d you must file your taxes to get your stimulus check.  Tip : Be on the lookout for a text message asking for details of your bank account. This is a  scam ! You don't have to disclose your bank account details to the IRS or anyone else to receive your stimulus money.\\\\xa0  How do I claim my stimulus payment when I file my taxes?  So if you've moved, changed banks, or received the message\\\\xa0 \u201cPayment Status #2 \u2013 Not Available\u201d with the IRS tool \u2014\\\\xa0or if you haven't received your stimulus payment by January 15th \u2014 don't worry. You can still receive it once you file your taxes.  Note, too, that if your tax situation has changed since you last filed in 2019, you must file to get any additional stimulus that is owed to you. Here are a few reasons this might apply to you:  You had a baby in 2020 and now qualify for an additional $600 based on this \u201cdependent\u201d You made less money in 2020 than 2019, so you now qualify for the stimulus based on your 2020 income  One last important thing to know: if you are also claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or Child Tax Credit (CTC), your entire refund, including your stimulus payment, will be delayed until at least March. But you should file anyway \u2014\\\\xa0there is a lot of money on the table!  We'll share more news soon about other important updates you should know about from the stimulus bill (there was a lot in there!). In the meantime, with tax season quickly approaching, be sure to get proactive about stimulus #2. '\""}
{"text": " Opportunity cost is an economics concept with huge implications in every aspect of our lives. To put it simply, when you say \u201cyes\u201d to one thing, you are saying \u201cno\u201d to another.  Opportunity Cost in the Real World  Let's try an example. Say your goal is to build healthier habits by exercising every day. When you wake up in the morning, you can either get up to exercise as you planned, or you can go back to sleep to get more rest. Both exercise and adequate sleep are important, and you only have time to do one this morning.  So which do you say \u201cyes\u201d to, and which do you say \u201cno\u201d to? There's no correct answer. And only you can decide which is more important to you at that point in time.  Think about opportunity cost in terms of how you spend your time. In each moment, you can only be in one place doing one thing. There is always an opportunity cost of the other things you could be doing.  Opportunity Cost of Your Money  Opportunity cost is a helpful concept for thinking about how you spend your money. If you spend a dollar on one thing, that dollar is not available to spend on something else (or to save or invest).  But this isn't about shaming you for spending\u2014it goes both ways. When you save in a retirement account or invest in the stock market, that money usually isn't available for your immediate needs and wants. That's another opportunity cost. Those dollars can only be used for one thing.  Consider the Big Picture  So does this mean you shouldn't save or invest, because that money won't be available for other things? Of course not! When thinking about opportunity cost, I want you to make all financial decisions with the bigger picture in mind (what you're saying \u201cno\u201d to by saying \u201cyes\u201d to something else).  When I leave my home and pull up directions for how to get somewhere, the app tells me the fastest route. It doesn't tell me that the longer route (which takes a whole eight minutes more of my time) takes me along a beautiful reservoir that fills my heart with joy. Most days, I'm willing to give up that eight minutes. '\""}
{"text": "What is the difference between a bank and a credit union?  Submitted by anonymous.  Banks and credit unions serve similar roles in our financial system. Both hold our deposits and make investments to raise money to lend to businesses and individuals.  In general, banks are for-profit businesses. Their profits benefit their shareholders. This is one of the main differences between the two types of institutions. Credit unions are nonprofit entities where you become a \u201cmember\u201d (actually a shareholder) when you open an account. While they offer the same services as most banks, they often offer lower fees and higher interest rates on accounts.  I am a fan of banking in your own community (that's how we use our dollars to create the community we want) and generally recommend credit unions or community banks. '\""}
{"text": "    Sign up for SaverLife  to take the Tax Time Pledge and enter to win cash prizes.  We know taxes are important. The government needs revenue to do things it does for our society. We want to comply with the law and pay the taxes we owe. Plus, most of us want a refund if we are entitled to it. But having to pay to get that done, when our tax situation seems simple, can be frustrating. Luckily, there are excellent free options!   Some quick links if you want to go straight to one of the options above:  IRS Free File website VITA information  and  VITA locator Free File Fillable Forms IRS2Go mobile app  to check your refund status, make a payment, and find free tax prep assistance  File Your Taxes Using Free File  Some of us have been frustrated in the past when we see an advertisement for free tax filing. But then we go to do our taxes, and it turns out that we still end up paying. Here's the solution. The IRS has a program called IRS Free File. The IRS partners with many tax preparation companies that you may recognize to offer their software for free. It can help you find an option for totally free tax filing software. You'll be able to know before you get too far in if it will truly be free for your situation.   There is an income limitation. For the 2021 Filing Season (2020 tax returns) your income must be less than $72,000 for 2020 to qualify. This limit is based on your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). For most people, AGI is close to or the same as their Gross Income. Also, the more complicated your return, the less likely you'll be able to get it done and filed completely for free. The IRS has a list of  forms that the Free File partners offer for free . Partners only have to offer the most commonly used forms for free. One of the advantages of Free File is that once the 2021 Filing Season gets started, you can compare the different Free File partners offers through IRS.gov.  If you file state income taxes, check whether you will be able to file your state tax return for free through Free File. As we roll into the 2021 Filing Season, you'll be able to  check out Free File partners . A disclaimer: while Free File makes it easier to find a truly free option, there can still be cases where something comes up after you've chosen a software option. You may need to file a form that isn't supported by the free option offered by the Free File partner. Unfortunately, this is normal due to our complicated tax code. If you haven't filed your return yet, you aren't obligated to pay. You can go back and choose another option or look for a free in-person option.   Get Help Filing Your Taxes with Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA)  The IRS's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs offer free basic tax return preparation. But there are qualifications. Generally, VITA is for people earning $57,000 or less, but some locations may go higher. There is also VITA support for people with disabilities and for taxpayers with limited English. Most VITA programs are for older folks, for minorities, and for military service members. If you find one that focuses on a group that you aren't part of, they may still be able to help you. It doesn't hurt to ask!  Much like the IRS Free File program, there are typically limitations on the type of forms a VITA location will do for taxpayers. And some locations offer guided tax return assistance, meaning you will be doing the tax return with their help. So, if you want them to do it for you, check ahead of time to see what they offer. You can find a location using your preferred internet search engine, but I prefer the  VITA locator tool . Check during tax season (usually January \u2013 April) if you can't find a location close to you outside of tax season.   File Your Taxes the Old-School Way  You can go to IRS.gov, print out the forms, and read the instructions to do your tax returns by hand. The IRS prefers that taxpayers file tax returns electronically and many states encourage taxpayers to file their state taxes electronically. It will generally take you longer to prepare a tax return on paper. Plus, processing a paper tax return will almost always take longer.  Once the 2021 Filing Season is up and running in January, you can also get  fillable forms online  on the IRS website. Anyone can use these to file electronically. But with this electronic filing, you have to follow the publications and instructions on your own. It doesn't include software to help with preparing tax returns.   So those are some free tax filing options. Maybe you can't avoid taxes, but perhaps you can avoid  paying  to fulfill your tax obligation when your situation isn't too complicated.  ***  SaverLife is a nonprofit that helps you save money with helpful tips, a supportive community, and prizes to reward you on your savings journey.

{"text": " If you get a conventional loan and make a down payment of less than 20 percent of the home price, you are required to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI). PMI protects the lender (not you) in case you fail to make your mortgage payments.  Banks, savings associations, credit unions, and mortgage companies make conventional loans to creditworthy borrowers at interest rates based on market conditions. The federal government does not insure these loans.  It's important to note that PMI pays for losses that a lender has because of foreclosure. It protects the lender in case you default on the loan. It will not pay your mortgage loan payments.  How does private mortgage insurance work?  PMI has an annual premium. This premium is divided by 12 in the form of a monthly charge added to your mortgage payment of principal, interest, (property) taxes, and (property) insurance (PITI). Even though you're the one paying, PMI is protection for the lender in case you default on the loan.  How much does private mortgage insurance cost?  The cost of PMI varies. Generally, borrowers who are a higher credit risk (lower credit score) pay higher fees for private mortgage insurance.  When can I stop paying for private mortgage insurance?  PMI is automatically canceled when your mortgage balance reaches 78 percent of the original value of the house. However, there are exceptions. If you have a high-risk loan, have not been current on your payments, or have other liens on your property, your PMI may continue. You can also cancel your PMI through written request \u2013 with the exceptions listed above \u2013 when you reach 20% equity in your home based on the original property value.

{"text": " With the second stimulus bill now in action, let's make sure you get the stimulus money you're eligible for! If you're a California resident, there's some key information you need to know. (But if you're not, make sure to read  Beyond the Check: How the Second Stimulus Bill Will Benefit You .)  The coverage can be confusing. So to get all the money that's due to you, take advantage of the changes from the new stimulus bill, and maximize your tax refund, there are five key pieces of information that pertain specifically to Californians.  1. Earned Income Tax Credit: CalEITC  Do you want to know more about how the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) can help your family this year?  The great news is, more families are eligible for the CalEITC this year. And the federal EITC has made it easier to get a larger rebate. When filing your 2020 tax return, you'll have the option of using your 2019 income to claim an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC). This change ensures that families who lost employment income in 2020 don't lose eligibility for EITC and CTC or have their EITC/CTC payments reduced.   In California, ITIN filers and their families are also now eligible to receive the EITC.   Tip : For help, visit  caleitc4me.org .  2. Stimulus check  Have you received a stimulus payment this month?  If you've heard about the stimulus check, but thought, \u201cI probably won't qualify,\u201d take another look. A  recent poll of SaverLife members  showed that 8% mistakenly thought they weren't due a check for inaccurate reasons such as not paying taxes or receiving government benefits. Just because you haven't gotten a check, direct deposit, or EIP card yet doesn't mean you aren't  due a payment . But you may have to file your 2020 taxes to receive it \u2014 even if you earned $0 in 2020.   Tip : We wrote about eligibility for the second federal stimulus  here .  In fact, you may be eligible to receive a stimulus check from the federal government  and  from the State of California. Your household is  eligible  for a $600 payment if you qualify for the CalEITC, if you have an income below $75,000 including households with ITINs, enrolled in the CalWORKS program, receive SSI/SSP, or the Cash Assistance Program for Immigrants (CAPI). Some of these payments will start going out in mid-April, so watch out for more information.  In addition, there may be more federal funds coming your way, so keep an eye out as we update information.  3. Housing assistance  Do you need help paying rent or mortgage?   Be on the lookout for more rental assistance programs that will help both renters and landlords with payments. In the meantime, there are guidelines in place to protect tenants and homeowners during the pandemic. For instance, right now there is a ban on all COVID-related evictions in California through June 30, along with help to pay back rent. Tenants need to pay 25% of their rent each month by June 30, and declare that they had COVID related financial hardship. Keep an eye out for more information. In the meantime, learn more about what you can do to protect yourself and your family at  Housingiskey.com  and  The United Way of CA .  And if you're behind on your energy bills, visit the  California Department of Community Services & Development  to see if you qualify and to apply for help paying your bills.  4. Student loans  Are you struggling to make student loan debt payments?   Federal student loan payments are on pause through at least September 30, 2021. That date may be extended further. You may already have received notice from your student loan servicer with a notification that you need to pay, but stay tuned for more news on that front.  There is also more you can do to lower your monthly payments in the long term. This includes switching to an  income-driven repayment plan .  More good news is on the way for Californians, specifically. On July 1, 2021, in California, a Student Borrower Bill of Rights will go into effect. This Bill of Rights will help protect borrowers from predatory lenders. In the meantime, borrowers may begin to file complaints against loan servicers through  California's Department of Financial Protection and Innovation  (DFPI). And after July 1, borrowers will be able to get clearer answers from their services on repayment plans, loan forgiveness options, and how to avoid default.  5. Unemployment insurance   Have you lost your job or had your hours reduced?  Help is on the way. If you've already received payments in the past, California's Employment Development Department ( EDD ) will automatically recalculate your payments, either online or via mail or text. What this means:   You'll receive an additional $300/week through March 13, even if you have already reached the 30-week limit from past payments. EDD will automatically recalculate and notify you. If you are self-employed or a contractor, you will need to submit proof of employment or self-employment. A new $100 per week benefit is now available through March 13 to self-employed individuals who received at least $5,000 in annual income but were eligible for regular state unemployment benefits, not Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.  Keep an eye out for notices in the mail from EDD. These notices may require immediate action to trigger these additional benefits. For information on how to file a claim,  go here . We strongly recommend you  apply online .  Note : If you have not applied for unemployment benefits before, you will need to register.   If you're experiencing difficulty with your unemployment benefits, and you are unable to resolve the issue by contacting the EDD,  try this online resource  or reach out to your  Assembly member !   Tip : EDD can also  help you look for work .  Note : You will need to  pay taxes on your unemployment income  when you file!  It's a lot of information taking the time to look into any of these areas that apply to you will pay off. We want to make sure you get the money you're eligible for, so you can come out of this pandemic in great financial shape! '\""}
{"text": "Your  Annual Percentage Rate (APR)  is the interest you will pay over the course of a year. This doesn't tell you how much you will actually pay if your interest is compounded in shorter increments. Our loans are usually compounded monthly, or for most credit cards, daily! YIKES!  If you really want to know how much you're paying on your credit balances each day, divide your APR by 365 to come up with the daily interest charge. '\""}
{"text": " Unemployment insurance can provide a temporary but vital replacement of earnings during the COVID-19 crisis. Unemployment insurance (UI) is a joint federal-state program. It's administered by states and provides cash benefits to eligible unemployed workers. In response to COVID-19, qualifying for unemployment has become more flexible.  Even if you didn't qualify for UI in the past, you may qualify now.  Criteria to qualify for unemployment insurance  Normally, to qualify for UI, you must be unemployed due to a lack of available work and must meet minimum work and earning requirements. In light of COVID-19, federal guidelines have expanded UI to more workers. Your eligibility depends on your personal circumstances and your state's policies. In general, assistance now includes workers who:  Can't go to work because their employer temporarily closes due to COVID-19 Are diagnosed with or are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking diagnosis Are ordered to isolate or quarantine by a medical provider or public health official Can't work due to caregiving responsibilities directly related to the pandemic Have exhausted their regular unemployment insurance benefits Aren't ordinarily eligible for unemployment benefits, including self-employed workers, gig workers, part-time workers, and workers with low earnings or limited work experience, who have lost work or income because of COVID-19's health or economic consequences  UI is not available for those able to work remotely or receiving paid sick leave or other paid leave benefits for their customary work week.  What to expect when you apply  Weekly UI payments from early April through late July will have an extra $600. You may receive a prorated amount of this if you're still working part-time. Federal guidelines also allow states to extend UI payments for additional weeks.   Individual states administer UI benefits and set different guidelines for eligibility. To check on your eligibility and apply for UI benefits, visit your state's program online. Apply as soon as you can, and keep trying. Many states' systems are outdated and overwhelmed by applications. Once you submit your application, it may take three or more weeks to receive your first benefit check. '\""}
{"text": " Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) is a program of the IRS. VITA sites offer income tax preparation help free of charge for people who generally make less than $56,000 annually, people with disabilities, and those with difficulty speaking English. The program is also offered on military installations.  The offices are run by volunteers who have been through an intensive training taught by IRS agents. VITA sites use IRS-approved software and electronic filing is available. The sites are often in churches, schools, neighborhood centers, and sometimes even shopping malls.

Take a Virtual Tour  It can be hard to stop cabin fever from setting in when you can't leave the house. One way to avoid the boredom and teach your children more about the world around them is to visit museums, zoos, and historical sites virtually. I recommend these  28 virtual tour opportunities  to entertain your children.  Go on a Scavenger Hunt  If the weather is nice and you can safely get outside, you can take your kids on a scavenger hunt. Help them create a list of things that you can be on the lookout for while you walk the neighborhood. Anything from a squirrel in a tree to a heart-shaped rock is fair game. Make it a game to see who can find the most or who can spot some hard to find items. Looking around your neighborhood for different items will help you see your home in a new light. And getting outside and moving around can help you break up the day!  Create Found Art  It's amazing how many ordinary objects can be turned into art. Look through your home to find different and fun art supplies. You can use wrapping paper and old magazines to make collages or create personalized pillowcases by painting or sewing designs onto old pillowcases. This can be a good opportunity to see the things in your house with fresh eyes.  Make an Obstacle Course  One of the best ways to entertain your kids is to get them moving and let them use their creativity. Whether it's outside or in your living room, help your kids build an obstacle course. Have your kids come up with different movements such as jumping on one foot from one spot to another, crab walking, spinning in circles, or log rolling. Once they decide the movements, take turns completing the obstacle course and enjoy the laughter that follows!  Incorporate Educational Screen Time  While parents want to limit screen time, there are educational options out there to help your kids learn while watching TV. There are options like PBS Kids that offer free educational content for kids of all ages. You can also find yoga and other movement videos free on YouTube that will help your kids stay active.  Bake or Cook Something  Whether it's blueberry muffins from scratch or brownies from a box mix, baking something with your kids is a great activity. It can help your kids learn life skills and can also help them with math (fractions anyone?). You can have your kids help you choose what to make or even help you plan a meal. Baking or cooking with the ingredients that you have on hand can show your kids how to be resourceful. And the best part is, at the end you have a tasty treat!  There are just a few things that you can do at home during this crazy time to help keep your kids entertained.  Find activities that let your kids be creative and curious.  Times are stressful and it's good to let your kids be kids and have fun when they can. But that doesn't mean that activities have to break the bank! '\""}
{"text": " A Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account) allows you to save up to a certain amount of money in a non-deductible, after-tax account. Contributions to the account are not tax-deductible, but funds grow tax-free. Any withdrawals made after age 59 \u00bd are tax-free. The annual contributions limit, set by the Federal government, is $6,000 for 2021 for individuals under the age of 50 and $7,000 for individuals over the age of 50.   Roth IRAs are designed for individuals who earn less than $140,000 (single) or $208,000 (married) to save for retirement. You can make contributions to the account at any age as long as you have earned income. There are no required minimum distributions as with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.  How to Open a Roth IRA  To open a Roth IRA, look for a financial institution that has received IRS approval to offer IRAs. Examples are banks, credit unions, brokerage companies, and savings and loan associations. You can establish a Roth IRA at any time. Compare fees, and specific account requirements when selecting a Roth IRA.  Can I Take Money Out of a Roth IRA?  Funds withdrawn from the Roth IRA need to be qualified distributions. If you withdraw an amount equal to the sum you deposited, the distribution is not taxable income, so it's not subject to a penalty. If you withdraw funds before the age of 59 \u00bd, to be considered a qualified distribution they need to be used for the purchase of a first home, distributed to the beneficiary of the Roth IRA, or the Roth IRA holder has become disabled.   The biggest advantages are no taxes on withdrawals and being able to continue contributions while earning income. '\""}
{"text": "    Sign up for SaverLife  to earn points and chances to win cash prizes when you read articles like this!  There are many things you can do to level up your finances. One area you can focus on that will help across the board is to improve your credit score. Having a good credit score saves you money and gives you more options. It can help you get better loan interest rates and pay less for insurance. It can also give you more housing options, the ability to rent without a cosigner, and you can sometimes even get security deposits for things like utilities waived. But where do you start?  Here are six things to work on if you want to improve your credit score.  1. Pay Your Bills on Time  Paying your bills on time is a huge way to improve your credit score. Keeping up with your monthly payments shows lenders that you are a good risk. It also demonstrates that you manage your money well and don't overextend yourself. In the FICO Credit Scoring system, payment history accounts for 35% of your overall credit score. So, paying your bills on time can have a big impact as you work to improve your credit score.  2. Have a Credit Card  Credit is one of those things that you can't build unless you have it. The easiest way to  establish credit  is to get a credit card and use it responsibly. Fifteen percent of your FICO credit score comes from your overall length of credit history. Getting a credit card and making on-time payments can improve your credit score.  3. Keep Your Account Usage Low  Another thing you can do to improve your credit is keep your credit utilization low. When lenders and credit card companies look at your credit utilization ratio, they look at how much of your available credit you are using. To do this, they compare your total outstanding balances across all your cards to your total available credit. Ideally, you want to keep this ratio below 30%.    That means if you have one credit card with a limit of $1,000, you don't want to carry an outstanding balance of more than $300. The best way to keep this ratio low is to pick a few expenses you've budgeted for each month, charge them to your credit card, and then pay the balance in full each month. This allows you to keep your credit usage low.  4. Don't Default on Loans  Just as paying your bills on time helps your credit score, so does paying your loans and not defaulting on them. Defaulting on a loan can stay on your credit report for 7-10 years. Sometimes a default occurs after the first missed payment. It can also occur after several missed payments, depending on the terms of the loan. These missed payments will negatively impact your credit score. So, keeping up with your loan payments will help you improve your credit score.  5. Have a Good Credit Mix  When building and improving your credit score, it's important to maintain a good mixture of credit. This means that you want to have both installment credit (loans) and revolving credit (credit cards or charge accounts). Your credit mix accounts for 10% of your FICO score. It indicates to potential lenders how well you manage your money and whether or not you can meet your monthly financial obligations. While it is good to have a mix of credit, be sure to only borrow or charge what you can afford to pay back.  6. Open New Credit Sparingly  Another thing that can help improve your credit score is only opening new credit when you need it. This can help you avoid opening several new accounts all at once. Opening too many new accounts in a short period of time can lower your credit score and can also make you look like a risky borrower. Open new credit only when you need it and be sure to factor repayments into your budget.  Final Thoughts  Improving your credit score takes time, persistence, and patience. But it is possible! Be sure you understand what determines your credit score, know how your actions affect it, and recognize what you can do to change it. If you use your credit mindfully, pay your bills on time, and don't spend more than you can afford to pay off, over time you will see your credit score improve. This will give you more opportunities and access to better interest rates as you move forward.

{"text": " Public Service Loan Forgiveness  and  Teacher Loan Forgiveness  apply to federal student loans that you've borrowed, but not to any Perkins Loans. The Perkins Loan program was discontinued in 2017, but you might still be eligible for loan cancellation programs if you have Perkins Loans.  Perkins Loan Cancellation through Teaching  To have your Perkins Loans forgiven for teaching, you must provide services directly related to classroom teaching at the elementary or secondary level. If you're a guidance counselor or librarian at aschool libraries, you can also qualify for Perkins Loan cancellation. You need to be a full-time employee of the school. You also need to fulfill at least one of the following requirements:  your school serves low-income families you teach special education you teach math, science, bilingual education, or foreign language the state has labeled your district or school as a shortage area  Each full year that you teach, you can have a portion of your Perkins Loans cancelled. For the first two years of teaching services you can have 15% canceled per year. The third and fourth years, you can have 20% canceled per year. In the fifth year, 30% can be canceled.   It's possible to defer your loans while you're working towards cancelation. Contact your Perkins Loan servicer to learn more.  If you are not sure who your Perkins Loan servicer is, you can always contact the financial aid office at the school you attended when you borrowed the Perkins Loans.  Other Eligible Professions for Perkins Loan Cancelation  In addition to teaching, there are other professions that can qualify you for Perkins Loan Cancellation. These include early childhood education provider, firefighter, law enforcement officer, nurse or medical technician, and public defender.  See a complete list of employment and volunteer service that qualify.  The amount of your Perkins Loans that you can have canceled depends on the type of work that you do. Some occupations are eligible for cancellation of up to 50% of your Perkins Loans borrowed, while others qualify for 100% cancellation of your Perkins Loans.  Find out more and see if you qualify.

{"text": " You may have heard the Chinese proverb: the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now. The same is true with investing. If you think you'll have time to get started later, you should see  how that's working out for older generations .  The Power of Compound Interest  If you wait to invest, you miss out on a huge advantage \u2013 compound interest. An urban legend says that Einstein once called this the most powerful force in the universe.  Compound interest means the money you invest earns interest, and your interest earns more interest. This allows the growth of your money to accelerate with time. If you start early, you will give your invested dollars a better opportunity to build on each other. The following example shows the true power of this:  Amber saves and invests $5,000 a year between the ages of 25 and 35, and then she stops saving. Jeff does not start saving until age 35. He then saves and invests $5,000 a year for the next 30 years.  Amber has saved a total of $50,000 (10 times $5,000) and Jeff has saved a total of $150,000 (30 times $5,000). They both earn an average of 10% a year on their investments ( average historical return of stock market ).  Who do you think has more money at age 65?  Amazingly it is Amber! She has a little under $1.4 million. Jeff ends up with $822,000, 41% less than Amber, even though he saved three times more of his money. This is because he started 10 years later. This is why it makes sense to start investing sooner rather than later. You can play with the numbers yourself using a  compound return calculator .  Should I Pay Off My Debt First?  This question comes up often. I usually recommend setting aside some income to invest while paying off debt. Even if the interest rate on your debt is higher than the expected return on your investments, it is psychologically important to see your wealth grow as your debt goes down. Otherwise, it can be tough to stick to your debt reduction plan. For instance, you can set aside 10% of your income for debt repayment and 10% for investing. Once your debt is paid off, you can double your investment contributions. No amount is too small \u2013 even  $50 per month  can go a long way.   Check out more articles on  paying off debt .   So when is the best time to start investing? Right now!  Read more about investing:  Investing 101: Stocks, Bonds, and More How Can I Get Started with Low-Risk Investments? What is the Rule of 72?

{"text": "There are endless strategies for saving money, but one that comes up again and again is setting up an automatic transfer. Lots of research, including our research here at SaverLife, shows that this is a good way to save more. In fact, SaverLife members who set up automatic savings transfers are 5-6% more likely to save at least $20/month.  Are you on the fence about setting up an automatic savings transfer? Here are some reasons we think you should give it a try:  1. Save without thinking about it  We all lead hectic lives. It's hard to manage many competing priorities \u2013 so why not take one thing off your to-do list? By automating your savings, it happens without any effort. Many Savers tell us they set up a small automatic transfer and actually forgot about. Then, months later, they were shocked to see how much money they'd build up so easily.  2. Make saving a habit  At SaverLife, we like to say that saving is a behavior, not a balance. Even if you're not able to save as much as you'd like, putting money away every month helps establish a habit of saving.  3. Have a separate savings account to manage your money  Everyone wants to save more, but if you keep money in a single account, it can be hard to compartmentalize which money you're saving. By separating out a little bit of money every week or month, you'll be able to visually see how much money you have for spending.  But be careful!  Many people are concerned about setting up an automatic transfer because they worry they will incur overdraft fees. This is an important concern. One option is to turn off overdraft protection, so that if you try to withdraw more than you have in your checking account, the transaction is denied instead of hitting you with an overdraft fee.  But for some people, automatic savings transfers may just not be the right way to save \u2013 and that's great too! We want you to find a system that works for you. '\""}
{"text": " The pros and cons of deferring payments during the COVID-19 crisis  As you look for help to make ends meet, you may be looking at the increasing amount of creditors offering the ability to delay payments. It's great companies are taking quick action to help with the financial impact of COVID-19. But proceed with caution and consider the following three things before making a decision:   Your financial situation now  Your possible financial situation in the future What happens after the deferral period ends  Your financial situation now  Understandably, if you can't cover your expenses, the only option may be to delay payments. One of the biggest mistakes I saw people making during the last recession was not quickly reducing their spending. Start cutting non-essential expenses: cable, your cellphone package, etc.  The other mistake I saw people making was not calling creditors before the first missed payment. Creditors are far more likely to work with you if you call them  before  you miss a payment. Explain to your creditors how you are impacted by COVID-19 and ask for COVID-19 hardships programs. Most creditors and lenders have hardship programs, but programs specific to COVID-19 may be better. Ask about:  The effects on your credit score (ideally none) when you delay payments How long you can defer (creditors may extend deferrals if COVID-19 continues to spread) What happens once your start repayment  Your financial situation in the future   Even if you can pay your expenses, it may make sense to defer your payments. If you are paying expenses through savings and are facing a layoff or have little in savings, carefully consider accepting options to delay payments. Delaying payments frees up cash so you can save money. As mentioned before, ask about programs specifically for those impacted by COVID-19.  Is it worth it?  All payment deferrals will impact you. The key is understanding the impact and deciding if it's worth it.  The ability to miss payments is not free money. You will have to pay it back. How you pay it back depends on your creditors. Contact your creditors and ask what happens after the missed payment period ends. The COVID-19 crisis changes the rules, but in general, there are typically four possibilities that can occur once your deferral period is over:  Your creditors add your missed payments to the end of your payment period. So if you missed three payments, your total payment period would be three months longer. Your loan is modified. This can mean a higher interest rate or an extended payment period. You temporarily pay a higher amount. This higher amount is your regular payment plus a portion of the payments you missed until you have \u201cpaid off\u201d your missed payments.  Your creditor may ask for the total missed payments to be paid in full once your deferral period ends.  The last thing you want is to find yourself in a worse financial position because you accepted an offer to defer payments without knowing the consequences after your deferral period ends. Get all the facts so you can make an informed decision.  '\""}
{"text": " Dear Texas and Oklahoma members,  We know you're out of the worst of the storm now, and we also know the damage that remains is real. We want to share some resources where you can get help if you need it:   211.org  for help with bills  Red Cross  for family assistance  You may have heard that the IRS has extended the deadline to file taxes, for Texas and Oklahoma residents, from April 15 to June 15. From skyrocketing utility bills to buying groceries, filing taxes may not be at the top of your mind. But this year, more than ever, it is important to file your taxes, especially if you were unemployed or you believe you haven't received your full stimulus checks.   Even if you don't owe any money, or you normally don't file taxes, here are three reasons to file your taxes soon. And we want to hear directly from you, so ask questions and share your experiences with us in our  community forum .  1. Receive Your Full Stimulus Payments  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal government has sent out two rounds of stimulus checks. The government is also preparing to send out a third stimulus check. If you should have been eligible but didn't receive either or both of the payments, filing your taxes is the only way to get that money.   If you didn't receive the full stimulus amount from the stimulus payments, it's not too late! You may be eligible for the  Recovery Rebate Credit . The IRS has made some mistakes, and many Americans haven't received money from the first or second stimulus payments. The stimulus payments were based on your 2019 income, so if you faced a loss in income in 2020, if you were newly independent in 2020, or if you had additional dependents in 2020, you may receive additional money when you file your 2020 tax return. Read more about  how to claim your stimulus payment if you haven't received it yet .  Even if you don't normally file taxes (because you're on SSI or SSDI, you're retired, or you don't meet the IRS's income threshold), you need to do so this year to claim any missing stimulus money.  2. Claim Tax Credits  There are many tax credits that you may be eligible for, from the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to the Child Tax Credit. These credits can mean more money in your pocket to support yourself and your family.  The EITC helps working Americans by issuing them a credit when they file their taxes. If you qualify, your EITC will be based on your income and number of dependents.  Read more about the EITC , including some important changes this year and how your EITC may be impacted if you received unemployment benefits.  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has a helpful website dedicated to helping you understand what  tax credits you may be eligible for and how to claim them .  3. Use the \u201cLookback\u201d Feature to Maximize Your Refund   Did you earn less in 2020 than in 2019? You could qualify for a bigger tax refund! Congress approved a new \u201clookback rule,\u201d which means you can use either your 2019 or 2020 income on your taxes to get the biggest refund possible this year. Make sure you have your 2019 tax return available when you do your taxes this year.  We've also made a  cheat-sheet  on some great resources we recommend to help you navigate your taxes this year, including all of the ways you can file for free. Keep in mind that if you received unemployment benefits, you might owe taxes on those. If you run into any questions or are unsure whether you need to file, you can connect with other SaverLife members in the  forum . Either way, don't wait to file and claim the money you're due!

{"text": " The key to saving is quite simply, to spend less than you make. This works for all incomes, whether it's from a job, retirement, or government benefits like disability.  If you are spending everything that you have each month, then consider checking your spending for a leak in your wallet. When I say \u201cleak,\u201d I mean those little things you occasionally buy, that you justify because \u201cit's just a few bucks.\u201d  Start by going to your bank account and get a 30-day history. Every time money came out of your account, put it under its specific category. You will have food, eating out, and gas, just to name a few. Once you have done this for the entire 30 days, add up each category. Is there one that surprised you? Does your spending match what is on your budget sheet?    If not, you have some changes to make. But now that you know where your leak is, you can fix it. Instead of buying a coffee every day, make your own. Maybe you could set up a car pool if your gas is more than you thought. Is the eating out category too high? Make more meals at home. Whatever your leak is, start to make changes to plug it, and start putting the extra money into your savings.  Even if its only $5 a week, that $5 will make a difference. Before you know it, that small savings will grow to be $100, and then $200. Every time you spend money, ask yourself, \u201cIs this necessary or could I be putting this money into my savings account?\u201d Those little savings will add up just as quickly as those little purchases will. The difference is, one works for you and one works against you.   '\""}

If that sounds like you, regardless of what stage you are in the process, focus on your finances to increase your chances of success. Check out the tips below for a good place to get started.

Your mission lays out how you will achieve your vision, including details like your target market and your unique offerings.  How will you price your product?

You'll have to convince people that your business is a good investment, so make sure you have a solid business plan and confident answers to the questions above. You'll also need to explain exactly what you plan to do with any funds that you raise.  Funding your business can take many different forms, including:   Self-funding  using your savings or even a 401k (using retirement funds has  serious  implications, so before taking this step talk to a trusted financial professional)  Small business grants  Traditional loans  from a financial institution like a bank or credit union (you need to pay back this money with interest)  Venture capital  from investors (investors give you money in exchange for partial ownership in the company)  Crowdfunding  from friends, family, or other people who hear about your business   For more information about your funding options,  check out this guide from SBA .  Growing Your Small Business  If you've already got the basics figured out and are looking to expand your small business, this is a perfect time to reflect on your goals and how things are going in order to maximize the efforts you undertook to get your small business off the ground. Ask yourself:   What are you doing well?  What are you missing?  Is there room for growth? More demand, new product?  If money is tight, how will you manage your growth to ensure you don't increase your costs before you're sure you'll increase your sales?

{"text": " Just seeing the word \u201cbudget\u201d can give some people a headache. Instead of reaching for a bottle of aspirin, I suggest changing the way you think of a budget.   A budget is a tool that helps you use money so that you reach your goals. You control what you spend money on and how much money you spend. A vital part of a budget is getting clear on what is a need vs. what is a want.  The difference between a \u201cneed\u201d and a \u201cwant\u201d  Need : Spending that is essential to you being able to survive. Necessary spending includes basic food, a place to live, transportation to take you to work, insurance, and essential clothing.   Want : Spending based on a desire for something that is not essential to survival. This includes cable, gym memberships, eating out, entertainment, travel, and designer clothes.  It sounds easy, but it gets hard when we use this to purchase an essential item, then justify upgrading the purchase way above the amount needed to meet our basic needs. Below are a few examples.  Is a car a \u201cneed\u201d or a \u201cwant\u201d?  Should you purchase a new vehicle with upgrades that use nearly half of your take-home income, or should you buy a slightly used car with no upgrades? Also, some areas have excellent public transit. Having a car may be a \u201cwant\u201d if you can get to work, school, and buy essential items like groceries without a car. In this case, the car is a convenience that is a want, not a need. If your car breaks down due to normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d repairs in your owner's manual, can you fix it instead of buying a new car?  Is my house or apartment a \u201cneed\u201d or a \u201cwant\u201d?  Generally I would consider your house or apartment to be a \u201cneed.\u201d After all, we need shelter to live. But you may classify it as a \u201cwant\u201d if you are:  Buying a home when you can barely pay your bills and don't have savings Renting an apartment with extra space for, even though you rarely have guests over Paying more in rent so you can live in the trendiest area that's close to everything, instead of choosing a safe but cheaper apartment  What food is a \u201cneed\u201d versus a \u201cwant\u201d?  Food is also certainly a \u201cneed.\u201d But that doesn't mean that all food is a \u201cneed\u201d! Here are a few examples that come to mine for me:  Not having a meal ready when you are hungry or busy does not turn eating out into an essential expense If you are on a tight food budget, the more convenient the food item (pre-cut veggies, pre-bagged, pre-cut chicken, etc.), the more expensive the cost. It shifts the food from a need to want because you can buy a cheaper option.  Are my clothing and travel a \u201cneed\u201d or a \u201cwant\u201d?  Needing a bag for your laptop does not justify buying a Coach bag. Likewise, I certainly want you to take a break from work, but not if it means going into debt. You can do a \u201cstaycation\u201d in your area!  ***  Separating your needs from your wants allows you to create a spending plan based on the most important things to you. Maybe if you drove a cheaper car, you may be able to afford your dream vacation.   Every financial decision you make, no matter how small, will either get you closer to your goals or become a barrier to reaching your goals. Understanding needs and wants can help you prioritize how you spend so that you can reach your financial goals. '\""}
{"text": " The  National Bureau of Economic Research  (NBER) is the organization that decides if the US is in a recession. They define a recession as \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\u201d So, what the heck does this mean? In a recession, companies are making less stuff because people are buying less stuff, which means companies aren't hiring as many people to make stuff, so fewer people have jobs.  Recessions are not uncommon; since 1854, the U.S. has gone into recession about once every five years. The average recession going back to the 1850s lasted for about 18 months.   During every recession (this is my third as a financial professional), the news seems to say the same thing: \u201cThis time is different,\u201d and the US economy will \u201cnever\u201d recover. The U.S. economy has survived a civil war, multiple world wars, various political climates, the Spanish Flu, and domestic attacks on our nation (Pearl Harbor and the World Trade Center attack). We can and will survive a recession.  The following are four steps you can take NOW to prepare and survive a recession.  1. Create a \u201cCrisis Budget\u201d  You create a crisis budget by listing the essential expenses you need to pay monthly to survive a drop in income- such as food, shelter, and transportation. You can exclude costs you know you will ditch if you lost your job.    2. Focus on Saving  If you are facing a loss or a drop in income, any extra money, no matter the amount, should go toward savings. SaverLife offers a ton of great resources to help you save money.  3. Contact Your Creditors  If you are facing a job loss or drop in income, call your creditors now. Contact your creditors as soon as possible to let them know of a possible change in your income, even if you can pay your bills. Creditors are more likely to work with you if you contact them before there is a problem.   4. Have Grace  At the time of this writing, our nation seems to be facing one crisis after another: COVID-19, the outcry over racial injustice, natural disasters, and a challenging election season. You throw in a job loss, and you may find your temper shorter than normal. Talk to your kids about their worries and explain any changes you may have to make. Talk to your partner because sometimes fear comes out as anger. If you are stressed, get help.  The best way to manage a recession is to manage your finances. Taking the steps above will help you manage life financially during a recession. '\""}
{"text": " The  American Rescue Plan  is a  $1.9 trillion  relief package to help alleviate the hardship that millions of Americans feel right now\u2014 including checks directly to families and individuals like you. Here are the details about the stimulus checks. Visit our  other blog post  for more details about other benefits.  How Much Money Will I Get from the Third Stimulus Check?  Most households that received an earlier stimulus check will get one again, but the amounts are different this time. The baseline:   $1,400 to each adult $1,400 to each dependent \u2014 meaning, anyone claimed on a tax return, including older adults, disabled adults, and child dependents of any age  For example, a family of four could potentially receive $5,600  The dependent eligibility is different from the second stimulus check, but there are a lot of caveats to be aware of. It's important to read through the information on the  IRS website  or this  CNN article . A few important highlights:  Dependents don't receive their own stimulus checks; funds are sent to the household  If you share custody of a dependent,  both you and the other parent could get stimulus checks , depending on how you file your taxes You are still eligible to receive a stimulus check if you owe child support If you have more or fewer dependents since the last time you filed taxes \u2014 for instance, a new child was born into your family \u2014 you should update your number of dependents by filing your 2020 tax return   Payments will be sent out in a few weeks via direct deposit, as physical checks, or via Economic Impact Payment (EIP) debit cards.   Tip : Signing up for  direct deposit with the IRS  could help you get your refund even faster than waiting for a check or Economic Impact Payment debit card to arrive in the mail.  Who is Eligible for the Third Stimulus Check?  There's always fine print. Like the other two stimulus payments, not everyone qualifies. Here's who qualifies for a full payment of $1,400 per person:  Tax filers who are single: annual gross income (AGI) up to $75K Tax filers who are married and file jointly: AGI up to $150K Tax filers who are heads of household: AGI up to $112,500   Stimulus payments are phased out depending on income once you hit the above thresholds. Those in the following brackets are still eligible for partial payments:  Tax filers who are single: AGI up to $80K Tax filers who are married and file jointly: AGI up to $160K Tax filers who are heads of household: AGI up to $120K   Tip :  Use this calculator  to help you estimate the amount of your third stimulus check.   Tip :  GetYourRefund.org  is a quick way to apply for your tax refund and claim your stimulus check.    A Few Fine Points of the Third Stimulus Check  For the third stimulus check, anyone with a Social Security number can receive the stimulus check for themselves and their family members. This is good info for mixed-immigration status families and a change from the last bill.  It's important to note that if you are incarcerated,  you can still receive your check . And if you lost work or wages in 2020, you could get a higher amount than you did with the first or second stimulus checks.   And if you  normally aren't required to file taxes , either because of your income level or for other reasons, you are probably eligible for a stimulus payment.   Reminder : File your taxes by April 15!  Tip : If you haven't yet filed your taxes, read about  how to file your taxes for free  and  whether you should take a Refund Anticipation Loan .  The intention behind this stimulus check, as with the last two, is to support Americans during this difficult time. This may also be a good time to consider establishing savings habits to create a financial buffer for you and your family.

{"text": " Open Enrollment Period  If you buy you own health insurance \u2014 versus getting health insurance through your employer \u2014 you can review your options and renew or purchase your plan for the upcoming year during the annual Open Enrollment Period (OEP). The Open Enrollment Period takes place each year from November 1 to December 15 in most states. If you're looking to buy insurance for the first time or enroll in a new plan, this six-week period is your chance to sign up for coverage for the upcoming calendar year. In most cases, if you miss this window you'll have to wait until the following year to pick, pay for, and get going on a health insurance plan.  Some states that run their own health insurance marketplaces extend the open enrollment period. In 2020, the following states have opted to do this:  Idaho \u2013 December 16th Minnesota \u2013 December 23rd Rhode Island \u2013 December 31st Colorado \u2013 January 15th Massachusetts \u2013 January 23rd District of Columbia \u2013 January 31st California \u2013 January 31st New York \u2013 January 31st  Even if your state has extended its Open Enrollment Period, you'll still usually need to enroll by December 15th to get coverage that starts on January 1st.  Special Enrollment Period  There is one exception to the Open Enrollment Period. That's when you experience a Qualifying Life Event (QLE). Qualifying Life Events fall into three general categories:   A change in where you live (if a move would impact the kind of health insurance coverage you have) A change in your family unit (such as getting married or having or adopting a child) Losing the health insurance coverage you previously had (if your spouse loses their job, if you get a divorce from a spouse through whom you were insured, the death of a spouse or parent through whom you were insured, or if you turn 26 and age off your parents' insurance coverage).   All of these kinds of life changes qualify you to enter into a Special Enrollment Period (SEP). An SEP lets you shop on the Health Insurance Marketplace just like you would during the annual Open Enrollment Period. Your timeframe to shop and enroll in coverage is triggered by your Qualifying Life Event and not the general time constraints of Open Enrollment \u2014 and typically lasts 60 days. '\""}
{"text": " Think of a goal that you've set for yourself. Maybe there's a book that you want to finish, you want to start exercising three days per week, or you want to take the first step in changing careers. Those are all great goals, and there is one more that I want to put on your radar.  I want to talk about a practical goal that many people work towards every day: Living debt-free. For some people, this goal might seem more daunting than the others. For other people, living debt-free is a boring or tiresome goal. The truth is, it's one of the most important goals you can have, and one that is very possible to reach.  The first thing we need to do to get out of debt is to understand what debt is. Simply put by Oxford Languages: debt is \u201cthe state of owing money.\u201d Owing money on a car, student loans, credit cards, etc. puts you in debt. It may sound scary, but remember, it is possible to get out of debt and live debt-free. Just like with any goal, getting out of debt and staying out of debt takes work and commitment. Here are some suggestions that you can use to reach your debt-free goal.  1. Determine how much you owe  Add up all of your debt. Then decide how much you can pay toward your debt each month. You can determine how long it will take to pay off your debt by dividing how much you owe by how much you will pay each month. If you owe $1,000 and you pay $100 toward that debt each month, it will take about 10 months to pay off your debt. ($1,000/$100 = 10 months)  2. Determine your cash flow  It is important to know how much money is coming in as well how much is going out. Once you know where your money is going, you can adjust your cash flow to minimize extra costs so that you can put more money toward your debt.  3. Create a spending plan  A spending plan helps to keep you on track as you work toward your goal of living debt-free. It prioritizes  needs and wants , and it helps make your cash flow more predictable.  4. Save for emergencies  Sometimes the unexpected happens, and sometimes the unexpected is unexpectedly expensive. It helps to have a safety net, just in case. This is another area where a spending plan and adjusting your cash flow comes in handy. In addition to paying off your debt, set aside at least 10% of your income in a savings account. This may not be possible right away, but it is important to start by setting aside as much as you can to help with emergencies.  5. Find a financial coach  It is much easier to reach a goal if you have an accountability partner to help you! A financial coach will help you with these steps and more so that you don't have to go it alone.  6. Be patient  It took a while to accumulate debt, so it will take a while to get out of it. Just keep working toward your goal and you can reach it!  Working toward living debt-free can seem like daunting goal, but it is attainable and important. With hard work and commitment, you can live debt-free! '\""}
{"text": " We all know it's important to save money. But how do you balance saving towards both your short-term and your long-term goals? I recommend creating a savings plan that takes your budget, goals, and timeframe into consideration. This can help you be successful in saving in both the short and long-term.  Define Your Goals  First, you must define your savings goals. Get specific! Write down two or three savings goals you have. Assign each goal a due date. This lets you distinguish between short-term goals, those you can reach in one to three years, and long-term goals which take more than three years. Also, write down why you want to achieve each goal. Be as clear as you can. Your \u201cwhy\u201d keeps you motivated.  Pick Your Savings Method   Next, you need to pick your saving methods. This can depend on the timeframe for your goals and also on your risk tolerance. For short-term goals where you will need the cash sooner or you want to have easier access to it, a  high-yield savings account  is a good choice. It lets you earn higher interest but also gives you quick access to your cash with no penalties or fees. For longer-term goals, you might consider savings vehicles that have a higher return, like  investment accounts . Or you may have a retirement account that your employer maintains. Always factor in when you'll need the money and understand any taxes, fees, or penalties associated with the account you choose. There is also a lot of evidence to support having a separate account for each goal.  Know Your Budget  Now it's time to figure out how much you can save each month. This means creating a budget. Review your spending for the last several months.  Determine how much money you need to meet your necessary expenses. Make sure to account for the bills you pay each month, your groceries, debt payments, and other expenses that you have to pay to get through the month.  Next, look at what's left. This is where you will find money to save. Identify things you spend on each month that aren't necessary. What can you cut? How much you cut depends on how much you want to save and how hard you want to hit your goals. It can be helpful to not allocate every spare dollar to savings and keep some \u201cfun money\u201d in your budget. This helps you stay on track and not feel so limited. Identify how much you can comfortably eliminate and remember you don't have to cut out discretionary expenses entirely. Just cutting back can help you save.  Divide Your Savings Between Goals  Now you need to divide your savings between your goals. Using the goal completion dates you wrote down, determine how many months you have to reach each goals. Divide the total savings you need by the number of months until you want to complete each goal. This will give you how much you need to save monthly to reach your goal. Now divide up your monthly savings between each goal using how much you have to save towards each goal.    If you don't have enough to fully fund each goal, you'll have to prioritize. Some goals, like an emergency fund, are time-sensitive. Other goals, like saving for retirement, may need to be prioritized in order to take advantage of an employer match. Think about the goals that you have written down and how achieving each one reflects your values and changes your overall financial picture. Fully fund your top priority and allocate any unused savings towards your next priority. Once you reach your top priority you can add those savings to your next goal to achieve it sooner.  Track Your Progress   Now that you have a savings plan in place, you'll want to track your progress. Whether you use a pen and paper, Excel, or an app, be sure to record your monthly savings towards each goal. This will help keep you motivated!  Repeat the Process  Setting savings goals isn't a one-time thing. As things change, you'll need to repeat the process. And as you achieve your short-term savings goals, you'll want to start the process over and set new goals or save more towards your existing goals. No matter what, be sure to celebrate your wins and milestones along the way! Acknowledging your achievements will help keep you motivated going forward. '\""}
{"text": "\u201cWhat stock can I invest in that will earn money with low risk?\u201d  Submitted by Fernando A.  I'm glad you are thinking about investing while also considering the risk involved. Clearly you understand the relationship to risk and return (low risk = low return) and I am wondering about the goal of your investment plan.  Since you ask specifically about \u201ca stock,\u201d I want to focus on the benefit of diversification (not taking the risk of putting all of your eggs in one basket) and using  mutual funds  to begin your investment plan. If you invest in  one  stock, you are subject to the ups and downs of that stock with no protection. The benefit of a mutual fund (a basket of stocks and/or bonds) is that when one is up, another is down and you are balancing out your risk.  There are several apps to help you get started with investing. I am using  Acorns . I find it simple to use and it keeps me motivated to invest regularly for my future goals.

{"text": "Think about the lessons you learned about money. How do the messages you heard in your early years impact the way you view and manage money today? Research shows that lifelong money habits are formed early. In fact, psychologists believe that  by age 7  (I know, right?), kids have already developed long-lasting attitudes about money.  So how do you talk to your kids about money in a way that sets them up for financial success?  What Shaped Your Financial Attitudes?  Start by reflecting on how your childhood shaped your current financial behaviors and attitudes. How did you learn these lessons?  Many folks in our SaverLife community tell us that they remember their parents' frugality \u2013 or their parents' spending \u2013 and realize that they are unconsciously copying those behaviors, or consciously trying to act differently.  Model the Behaviors You Want Kids to Practice  Kids see and notice a lot, so unfortunately, the \u201cdo as I say, not as I do\u201d strategy often falls flat. I believe that it's not just about teaching good financial behaviors. We have to live those values we want to instill in our young people.  Here are a few questions I want you to consider:   What do your kids observe you doing or saying about money?  Are you stressed about money?  What words or phrases do you repeat often about money?  How do you think your kids interpret your messages?   Start Saving with Your Kids  If you're able to, I think giving your kids an allowance is a good way to practice managing money. Talk to them about their goals for their money and encourage them to save up for things that matter to them \u2013 perhaps a new bike or a charitable cause they care about.  If they meet their goals, celebrate with them! You could even consider setting up a small match to reward them for saving instead of immediately spending their money. (Sound familiar? If you haven't already,  sign up for SaverLife  so you can start earning rewards and prizes for saving.)  Involve Your Kids in Real-World Decisions  Everyday lessons are the easiest way to share your values. The next time you are shopping for groceries, think about the choices you make and describe your reasons to your children. I find that when I tell my grandchildren why I make the choices I do, they are clear about my values and how I behave with money, even when I make financial mistakes. For example, I explain to my grandchildren that I don't buy gifts because I believe in buying experiences instead.  So, if you're buying a car, moving to a new house, getting a pet, or paying with a credit card, involve your kids. Share your thought process to help them understand the complexities of financial decision-making.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has a great resource called  Money as You Grow  that dives deeper into important age-appropriate money conversations to have with your kids. '\""}
{"text": " Your No-Debt Black Friday Survival Guide  As a veteran, I often get eye rolls from my kids when I use military analogies to describe events. But as a financial coach, I can't help but see Black Friday as an epic battle. You're knee-deep in the trenches of holiday shopping goals and you're experiencing the rapid fire of sales ads coming at you from everywhere: TV ads, mail, emails, texts, and Facebook ads (my daughter says Facebook is like Instagram for old people, so fill in the blank to whatever social media site you use). Without a survival plan for your finances, you are one flashy Black Friday sales ad away from going into debt. You have to prepare both financially and mentally for Black Friday.     I know from experience. I was going through \u201cmom\u201d guilt right as I saw a flashy Black Friday sales ad for a $150 toy that is a \u201cmust have\u201d if you \u201creally love your 3-year-old kid.\u201d This was too much to bear and I bought the toy. At Christmas all she did was play with the box and completely ignored the toy. To date, that's the most expensive box I've ever bought.   Below is your \u201cNo-Debt Black Friday Survival Guide\u201d with the mission to protect your finances from debt at all costs!  1. Assess Your Resources  Write down who you want to buy gifts for on Black Friday. Review your spending plan to see how much you can spend on Black Friday without going into debt or compromising your other financial goals. Once you have this number, write it in large print, circled and highlighted on top of a sheet of paper and go to step 2.  2. Define the Mission  Using the sheet from Step 1, write down exactly what you want to buy on Black Friday BEFORE Black Friday and why you must buy this item. Write down how buying this item will impact your ability to reach other goals like getting out of debt, buying a house, or even finishing your holiday shopping without going into debt. Decide if it's really worth it. Remember: A sale is not an excuse to buy an item you cannot afford.  3. Examine Your Enemies for Weaknesses  If after doing #2 you still want to shop on Black Friday, the next step is to examine your enemy (the store) for weakness, which are sales ads. Start early and research your favorite store websites along with  Black   Friday   websites  to find the best deals.  4. Map Out Your Shopping Battle Plan  Map out where and when you are purchasing your items. You are committing to only purchase the items on your plan and nothing else as well as to stick to your budget. If you need motivation, write \u201cNo Debt Black Friday\u201d at the top of your plan to keep you focused.  5. Triage If Needed  If you have a Mercedes shopping list with a Kia holiday budget, you may have to triage. This means deciding who you're going to give gifts to and how much you're going to spend on each person.  Get creative! One of the best gifts I ever got was a voucher from a friend offering free babysitting. And one of my friends gave me an awesome homemade cake. If you have young children or super cute animals, use these weapons of mass cuteness to your advantage:  Snap pictures on your phone and print them at your local CVS, Walgreens, or Rite Aid or use your home printer Shop for inexpensive picture frames at your local dollar store or thrift store   Give as inexpensive gifts!  With a survival plan you can emerge from Black Friday victoriously conquering tempting sales ads without debt.  '\""}
{"text": "Why do different companies show different credit scores? Credit Karma showed my score 70 points higher than the banks!  Submitted by StillLearning.  Ah, the mysteries of credit scores. Let's get the nuts and bolts down, then we can talk about the best approach to getting the information you need. There are several credit reporting companies and they each use different calculations. The key to managing your credit score is to know the source of the information and your reason for tracking your score.  How Credit Scores Work  Let's look at how your credit score works step by step.   Lenders report to one or more of the credit reporting companies, which are also called credit reporting bureaus (Experian, Equifax, Transunion).  The three bureaus keep their own reports of your payment history. They create their own score and report to  FICO  and  VantageScore .  Whew! Take a deep breath and check out this  infographic  that might help all of this make more sense.   Federal law requires that the three reporting bureaus provide you with a free  credit report  (a record of your borrowing and payment habits) every 12 months, but you often pay for your FICO score.  Credit scores  are big business because they are used to determine your eligibility for loans and what your interest rate will be. Low scores generally mean higher interest \u2013 YIKES!  There are some free credit scores that are often called \u201ceducational scores.\u201d These are modified by the bureaus and offered through secondary sites like Credit Karma and Credit Sesame. These sites can be helpful if you are learning how to manage credit and they often have excellent tools to explain complex concepts. However, you may notice that the scores are not the same as FICO or VantageScore.  Pop Quiz  Read the following statement from the Credit Karma website and tell me why the score provided may differ from FICO.  \u201cCredit Karma shows your scores from Equifax and TransUnion, calculated using VantageScore 3.0. It's free and there's no impact to your credit.\u201d  (Cue Jeopardy music) YOU GUESSED IT! The score doesn't reflect information from Experian.  Here are a few more things about your credit that you should know:   Checking your own credit report and score never impacts your credit score. So there is no reason to be wary of checking your score.  The \u201ceducational\u201d scores often are from sites that want to sell you financial products. Be WARY of ads to upsell you from the \u201cfree\u201d service.  Don't count on free scores if you are planning to borrow money or apply for a mortgage or rental. Check your real credit reports for accuracy and pay for your FICO score so you know what to expect from a lender. The  Consumer Finance Protection Bureau  is a trusted resource for approved credit counseling agencies. The CFPB can help you obtain and review your credit reports. They can also help you create a plan to build credit or address problems with your credit history if necessary.   Take charge of your credit score by understanding how it works and what you need to do to verify accuracy and build a solid credit history.

{"text": " Are you considering investing money? If so, you should know about the Rule of 72. It helps you determine how long it will take for your money to grow a certain amount. The Rule of 72 allows you to figure out how long it will take for an investment to double at a given annual rate of return. You can also use it to determine the interest rate you need to find on your investment to have your money double in a certain period of time.  How to Use the Rule of 72  The formula for the Rule of 72 is:    Time = 72/ Interest Rate  In this formula:  Time is the years for the investment to double Interest Rate is the annual rate of return  Rule of 72 Examples  Here is an example of how to apply the Rule of 72. You want to invest $500 at a 6% interest rate. So, it will take your $500 twelve years to double and reach $1,000.  Time = 72 / 6 Time = 12 years  Now let's look at using the Rule of 72 to determine the interest rate you would need to find in order for your investment to double in a certain time.  You want your investment to double five years from now.  What interest rate does your investment need to earn to make this happen?  5 = 72/Interest Rate Interest Rate = 72 / 5 Interest Rate = 14.4%  Your investment would need to grow at 14.4% annually to reach your goal of doubling in five years.  When to Use the Rule of 72  There are many different calculators and Excel operations that allow you to determine the time it will take for an investment to grow to a certain level. The Rule of 72 is still good to know. It offers a simple way for determining how long it will take an investment to double.  And the neat thing about the Rule of 72 is that it can be used in other areas of personal finance as well. You can use it to find out how often the cost of something is doubling if the cost increases at a constant annual rate. You can also use it to determine how quickly inflation will decrease the value of your savings by half. The Rule of 72 is both simple and useful and allows you to think about changes in your investments and costs in a more concrete way.

{"text": "What happens when you have a financial setback? You may feel defeated and even hopeless when your efforts to save take a hit.  Saving helps prevent financial emergencies  Consider this: many of the financial hiccups we face are NOT actual emergencies. For example, we know that if we own a car we are likely to need repairs. Of course, they become emergencies because they usually happen when we are least prepared.  Preparation is the whole point of starting a saving habit. You may have to dip into your savings to pay for car repairs or other unexpected hits to your wallet \u2013 and that is exactly the reason to create a habit of saving.  1. Resources for handling emergencies  If (well, I guess we should say \u201cwhen\u201d) you have a financial setback, do what you need to do to address the situation. Look at all of the options available to you, including your savings. Your long term financial health is sure to be better if you choose the lowest cost options (money you've saved, borrowing from family/friends) or  small dollar loans  from a credit union (try to avoid payday lenders).  2. Revisit your savings goals  Be sure that you have a plan to repay yourself \u2013 just like you would if you borrowed from someone else. Once you have dealt with the emergency, get back on track. If you can add a little extra each month, you will rebuild your savings account in no time.  This is also a great time to look at your financial priorities and goals and create a savings target for unplanned expenses. A good starting point is the total amount of ALL of your insurance deductibles (health, auto, renter's/homeowner's). That way, you always know your financial protection plan is secure.  3. Don't dwell in shame  Keep in mind, financial emergencies are often normal situations that we simply weren't prepared for. Abusing ourselves with shame or blame is never helpful.  Learn the lesson, leave the shame.  What do you want to do to be better prepared next time (and we know there is always a next time)? '\""}
{"text": " It's important to talk openly with your family about your financial goals, values, and situation on a regular basis. However, that's easier said than done. As early as preschool, you can start talking to children about money and building their financial skills in age-appropriate ways. For preschoolers, you might focus on the skill of waiting (delayed gratification) or counting. For high schoolers, you might discuss healthy habits and help them open a bank account.  When you work together as a family to set financial priorities and follow a plan, you're more likely to stick to it. Collaborative planning helps everyone make day-to-day financial choices that are in line with your goals, values, and financial reality.  If you don't already talk about your finances as a family, there is no time like the present to start. Whether money is tight or not, here are some tips to consider:  Start with Goals, Values, and Essentials.  To help you make financial decisions, what is vital to the family? What does your family need to survive and thrive? Gather your family and talk about what is important to you collectively. Try to agree on the top priorities that you all intend to focus on together.   Establish a Schedule to Talk about Your Finances as a Family.  Think about how often you want and are able to check in. Weekly, monthly, or some other interval? Use these meetings to check in on how things are going and troubleshoot any issues.  When Changes Arise, Meet as Soon as Possible.  Such changes could include an economic recession, job loss, or a health situation. Be proactive and transparent about what this means for your financial situation to help your family manage their expectations.  Practice Clear Communication.  Practice communicating your financial concerns ahead of time. That way, you can deliver them calmly and clearly. This will increase the chances that your family will hear them and respond in ways that address the concern. Talking about financial challenges can be emotional and create conflict.  It's no guarantee, but practice will help you deliver your message in ways that bring people in to resolve the situation.  Work Together to Make Tough Decisions.  When money is tight, it can be hard to balance the essentials and what everyone wants. If you're struggling to make ends meet or want to build up your emergency fund to weather a recession, your family decisions become about trade-offs in priorities and trying to spend less than what you are bringing in.

{"text": " The home is the perfect place for kids of all ages to learn and practice personal finance. Here are some specific ways you can involve your kids in everyday budgeting and family finances, all while teaching important life lessons.  Consult Your Kids When Making Your Monthly Budget  Let your child know that you're looking ahead to the next month and ask them for input on the family's budget. This is their opportunity to give you advance notice of expenses they think are coming up. Maybe there's a special school or sporting event that has a cost. Maybe their birthday is coming up. Your preteen son may tell you his shoes are getting tight ( again ) and he needs a larger pair of shoes.  Of course, your child may also want to add an item that the family cannot afford at this time. This is a perfect opportunity to teach one of the tougher lessons of personal finance. Some good things that we want need to be delayed so we can meet the family's needs first.    Involving Your Child in the Budget Is a Win for Both of You  This will help you to craft a budget that looks ahead and foresees expenses, instead of keeping them as a bad surprise during the month. This will help the child by modeling the importance of creating a monthly plan for how the family's income will be spent, saved, or given away during the coming month. It will also help them with the fundamental skill of thinking ahead and planning for the future. That skill will serve them their whole life.  Tip : A monthly budget is a helpful financial tool. If you're not yet using it, check out this  SaverLife article .  Give Your Kids Insight into Your Daily Finances and Decision-Making  This is easier than it may sound. Think about what financial tasks and goals you have and then, age-appropriately, let your kids in on those things by talking to them as the task naturally occurs. For example, most parents are encouraging (maybe begging) their kids to turn off the lights when they are not being used to \u201csave electricity.\u201d Now take it a step farther and share with your child the electricity bill. You can note that it's often higher in the winter when you need to heat the house and discuss what things in the house use electricity. You're building knowledge and connections between a lifelong task (turning off the lights) and its impact on finances.  Note : Choose topics that are helpful for your child to have a positive lesson in personal finances. Financial information that is stressful or involves conflict should be left to the adults in the family.  Help Your Children Understand How to Find Trusted Financial Resources  Today, marketers and those who make money off of particular products are offering lots of advice. But be aware that they are offering advice that helps them, and not necessarily you. So, who can you trust? The first place I recommend for financial education resources is the federal government's consumer protection agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  The CFPB's mission is to make sure \u201cbanks, lenders, and other financial companies treat you fairly.\u201d The CFPB has free resources for consumers, parents, and educators on nearly any financial topic you can imagine.  Their goal is to help you \u201cmake informed financial decisions and build financial skills.\u201d For teaching personal finance to kids, see their section  Money as You Grow .  Many resources are available in English and Spanish.  Experience Is the Best Teacher  In addition to the ideas above, I'm sure you'll see many opportunities to involve your child in personal finance and budgeting. They may not thank you now (although some will), but their grown-up selves will surely appreciate and benefit from your efforts. '\""}

{"text": " In order to create a budget that not only works, but that you can thrive on, it helps to consider your needs and wants. It can be hard initially to see any of your spending as a want because you can't see your life without it. But if you take a step back and evaluate your needs and wants, you will find ways to budget better. This will have a positive impact on your financial life as a whole.  What is a Need?  A need is a good or service that you must have in order to survive. The number of needs a person has is limited. For the most part, needs are consistent from person to person. This category includes shelter, clothing, food, gas and electricity, transportation, and healthcare.  What is a Want?  A want is something that you desire to make your life better or more fulfilled, but doesn't impact your immediate survival.  Wants can include eating out, entertainment, travel, gym memberships, designer clothing, and anything else that you would like in your life. Unlike needs, which cover a more limited range of expenses, wants are limitless and vary greatly from person to person.  It's important to remember that some basic expenses are a need but can also become wants depending on circumstances. Transportation, for example, is a need at the basic level. You need a subway pass or a car to get to work, get groceries, and take your kids to school. You don't, however, need to go all of these places in a luxury car. That is a want.  Dividing Your Expenses  Now that you understand the difference, divide up your expenses as either needs or wants. To do this, look at all of your monthly spending and give each expense the category of need or want. Remember that you may need your cell phone to communicate, so it can be labeled a need. But no matter how much you feel like you can't live without it, your streaming service is probably a want.   If you aren't sure if an expense is a need or a want, it can help to think about it from a slightly different perspective. You can apply the MoSCoW model, which stands for Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have, to the expense. If the expense is a Must have, it is a need. If it is a Should have or a Could have, it is a want. But if it is a Won't have, then you can cut it from your budget. As you work on your budget, you can prioritize the Should have spending over the Could have spending to incorporate your values into your budget.   Building Your Budget   Knowing the difference between your wants and your needs can help you develop a budget you can actually stick to. To start, define your income. This will let you know how much you can spend and save in a given month.  Next, budget for all your needs. Start by subtracting your necessary monthly spending from your income. Once all of your needs are accounted for, you can start adding your wants into your budget. Include your high-value wants into your budget first. This will allow you to cover the expenses on the things you really value before worrying about the things that aren't as important.  A Few Things to Remember  Needs and wants can change over time as your circumstances change, so be flexible and consider your budget often.  Remember to factor debt repayment into your budget. It may not feel like a need, but to keep your credit score up, stay out of collections, and pay less interest over time, those payments still need to be made. Saving is also not necessarily a need or want, but something you should factor into your budget.   If you make sure that your needs are taken care of first, you will be able to use what is leftover to cover some of your wants. This will help you create a sustainable budget, move your personal finances forward, and reach your personal finance goals. '\""}

{"text": " Submitted by Renee K.  This is a great question. Before your question, no one has ever asked me about this, so thank you for letting me get this info out!  What's a land contract?  A land contract is an agreement between a buyer and seller. The buyer purchases property directly from the seller without the involvement of a bank.  Benefits of a land contract  For some people, a land contract is a great option for purchasing a home if they can't get a traditional mortgage. It can let you buy a home while showing on your credit report that you don't have as much debt in comparison to your income. This is called debt-to-income ratio.  Drawbacks of a land contract  On the flip side is the reality that the payments you make go directly to the seller instead of a bank. This means your payments may not be reported to the credit bureaus. You may miss out on the benefit of building an on-time payment history with the payments you make. You might think that as long as you have a record of your payments and the seller agrees with you, then you can report this payment history to the credit bureaus yourself. Unfortunately, that's not the case.  Getting your payments reported to the credit bureaus  You are not able to report the payments to the credit bureaus. Only the creditors can report. That means you're at the mercy of the seller in this situation. You can ask the seller to report your payment history to the credit reporting agencies. That would allow the payments to be added to your credit report.   But, more often than not, individuals who act as creditors in a land contract arrangement do not report payment history because they have to pay a fee to register with the reporting agencies and report payments. Consider negotiating with the seller. It may be to your benefit to offer to pay the fee if they are unwilling to do so.  Even if your credit report doesn't show the payments, be proud of yourself for taking on the challenge of paying for your home and making all the payments so that you own it outright. That feeling of freedom can't come from your credit report. '\""}
{"text": " Spoiler alert: Like many things in personal finance and taxes the answer is  it depends . And even when it does help, it won't be much help for most of us.  First, some background on deducting charitable contributions.  Before the CARES Act was passed this year (2020), taxpayers generally had one option to deduct charitable contributions. They had to itemize instead of taking the  standard deduction . Most of us take the standard deduction because it gives us a bigger deduction than itemizing. A bigger deduction can mean less taxes paid and often a bigger refund.   The CARES Act permits eligible individuals to deduct $300 of qualified charitable contributions as an \u201cabove-the-line\u201d deduction. So you can take this deduction without itemizing. To be eligible, these must be cash contributions (cash, check, debit, or credit). And the contributions must be to an organization that the IRS recognizes as eligible for deductible contributions, typically a charitable organization. This deduction applies to Federal taxes and continues after 2020.  What documentation or proof do I need to deduct charitable giving?  If you give $250 or more to one entity, you must receive and keep documentation from the organization acknowledging your contribution. Even if it's less than $250, the IRS still says you should have documentation. But things like bank records and credit card records can suffice.  But will donations to charity help my tax situation?   For many, it will not help. You shouldn't give money just to get a tax deduction. If you are at the 10% marginal tax rate, giving $300 at best saves $30 in taxes. That is not a good return. The reason to give should be that it is the right thing for you to do and you can afford it.  Every tax situation is different. If your tax situation includes receiving Earned Income Tax Credit and Additional Child Tax Credit, this may not help reduce your taxes or increase your refund. Here is one example: if you are married, not anyone else's dependent, and file a joint tax return and your household gross income for 2020 is $24,800 a year or less\u2013 this deduction does not help you. You have already maxed your deductions for the year simply by being married and receiving the 2020 standard deduction of $24,800.   What if I'm not sure if it will help?  If you aren't sure and have someone who prepares your taxes, then ask them. My guess is they'll say the same thing I am going to say. And that is when you give money, keep the receipts and proof (the proof we talked about above). And then when you go to do your tax returns either bring it with you to your tax professional (or send it) or make sure you enter it in your tax software. Better to provide more information than less when it may help your tax situation.   If you would like to read more about the $300 charitable contribution deduction, I suggest going to  IRS.gov  and reading their tax tips.   Update and Clarification : The IRS has clarified that when filing a Married Filing Separate (MFS) tax return, the maximum charitable contribution deduction for non-itemizers is $150 for 2020. For other individuals and for Married Filing Jointly it is $300 for 2020. Also, for 2021 the Consolidated Appropriations Act increased this charitable contribution deduction for 2021 and later to $600 maximum for those filing Married Filing Joint tax returns. '\""}

{"text": " For years, I struggled to budget. I was frustrated that I was following all the budgeting rules but still coming up short. After carefully looking at my spending over a few months, I realized I was making several budgeting mistakes.  Once I corrected the errors, I was able to stick to a budget that helped my family become debt-free, save money, and buy a house. Below are some reasons people struggle to stick to a budget and how to overcome them:  1. Budgeting Only for Monthly Bills  Ideally, a budget is a written plan for how you are going to spend all your money on a monthly basis. I find the categories most people fail to include are school activities, restaurants, groceries, gas, entertainment, personal care, and gifts.  These are typically expenses without billed statements that go up and down each month. Either use your online bank budgeting tools or a  budgeting app  to track your spending to make sure your budget truly reflects all your monthly spending.  2. Having Unrealistic Expectations  It takes about three months to adjust to budgeting. Give yourself the grace to make mistakes and learn from them. Be realistic; it's tough to go from eating out every night to making homemade organic meals. It's okay to have a few frozen meals and limit eating out to your busiest days. Also, look for opportunities to make the most of your spending by dining at restaurants where  kids can eat free .  3. Overspending in One Area  If you spend most of your paycheck on a car or home, you will struggle to cover unexpected expenses (see #4). One rule of thumb is to spend no more than 25-35% of your take-home pay on a mortgage or rent. Another for cars is the  20/4/10 rule : Make a down payment of at least 20%, finance your vehicle for no more than four years, and spend 10% or less of your gross monthly pay on total monthly car expenses (car payment + insurance).  4. No Savings  Savings should cover at least two types of needs: known and unknown expenses. Upcoming known expenses include scheduled car and home maintenance, car registration and gifts. The other need is to cover those unfortunate surprises\u2014unusually high costs like transmissions repairs, medical expenses or a busted pipe in your home. Try to save at least three months of expenses in an account at a different bank than the one you use for daily spending.  5. Not Updating Your Budget Monthly  Your budget should change as your spending needs change. Examples include higher daycare expenses during school breaks, a higher electric bill in the summer, or a higher gas bill in the winter. Overlooking these fluctuations can have you scrambling to cover expenses.  Don't lose hope! With a few tweaks, you can find success with budgeting. '\""}
{"text": " If you're fortunate enough to have an employer who offers a 401(k), you should seriously consider participating. A 401(k) allows you to lower your tax bill and potentially build wealth through the stock market. Here's how to figure out how much you should contribute.  The power of the employer match  You should contribute at least enough to fully take advantage of your employer match if you are offered one. If you don't do that, you are simply leaving money on the table! For instance, your employer may match 100% of your contributions up to 5% of your salary. That means if you make $40,000 and contribute 5% of your salary ($2,000), your employer will contribute an additional $2,000. You are effectively doubling your money before anything happens in the stock market. If I came up to you and guaranteed that I would double your money if you invested with me, would you take me up on that?  Reasons to contribute more than the employer match amount  Should you stop there or contribute more than your employer match amount? Well, that depends on how much you have already saved. A good rule of thumb is to have one times your salary saved by age 30, three times by 40, and six times by 50 for retirement readiness. If you are running behind, you should probably try to contribute more than the employer match amount. Another important factor to consider is your goals. At what age do you want to retire? What type of lifestyle do you want in retirement? It may be necessary to increase your 401(k) contributions to reach your goals.   Small contributions can make a big difference   Contributing to your 401(k) and foregoing that money from your paycheck can seem tough. However, it's important to contribute whatever you can, especially if you are young and have plenty of time to experience compound investment returns. For instance, based on the historical average of stock market earnings, contributing just $50 a month would grow to an estimated $100,000 in 30 years ($200,000 if those contributions were matched by the employer)! You should consider increasing your contributions as you get older and your income increases. A good rule of thumb is to start by contributing the employer match amount and then increase your contributions by one percent a year.  A 401(k) can be a powerful tool to save for retirement. If you're not sure how much to contribute, don't get frozen with indecision and miss out. Just go with your gut and see how it goes; you can always make adjustments later if necessary.  '\""}
{"text": " Think about something that you want to accomplish in the future, like paying off credit card debt or student loans. Have you set a goal that will help you get there, or is it just something that you hope will happen? There is nothing wrong with hoping, as long as it is not your final step. A hope can be vague and open-ended, but a goal is what will guide you in achieving your desired outcome.  How to Create SMART Goals  How can you turn your hopes into goals? By thinking SMART! SMART is an acronym that can help you remember the components of an effective goal. Your goals should be  S pecific,  M easurable,  A chievable,  R elevant, and  T ime- bound. Let's look at an example.  Specific  Some people tell me, \u201cI want to live debt free!\u201d That's great, but that is not a very specific goal. In order to fix your goal, you should look at the amount of debt that you have. Let's say you have $10,000 in credit card debt. Instead of simply wanting to live debt-free, you can say that you want to pay off your $10,000 credit card debt. That is a specific goal. Now how can you achieve it?  Measurable  \u201cI will pay off some of my credit card debt each month until I am no longer in debt.\u201d Do you see the problem with that plan? It is not measurable. Paying \u201csome\u201d money toward a credit card does less to hold you accountable than if you say, \u201cI will pay $500 per month toward my credit card debt.\u201d $500 per month is measurable, but does it meet the next requirement?  Achievable  Being able to pay $500 per month toward your credit card debt is great, but make sure that this goal is achievable. Take into account your income as well as your other expenses. If $500 per month interferes with your ability to pay rent or your electricity bill, you may need to adjust your goal amount to something more feasible. You should also be realistic in your time frame expectations. For example, \u201cI want to pay off my $10,000 credit card debt in three months\u201d might be too difficult a goal to achieve.  Relevant  Make sure that the goal is relevant to you and your lifestyle. If paying off your credit card is not important to you, you will probably not make this goal a priority, which sets you up for not meeting the goal.  Time-Bound  You can determine how long it will take to pay off your debt by dividing how much you owe by how much you will pay each month. How long will it take you to accomplish the goal of paying off $10,000 in credit card debt? If you pay $500 per month, it will take 20 months to completely pay off $10,000 of credit card debt. ($10,000/$500 = 20 months.) It is important for goals to have a time frame or deadline to keep you accountable and on track. Remember, the target time frame should be achievable.   Setting SMART goals is a good method for achieving whatever your goal may be. Remember to always make sure your goals are  S pecific,  M easurable,  A chievable,  R elevant, and  T ime-bound. This will help make your hopes into goals, and your goals into reality!  With hard work and commitment, you can achieve financial freedom! '\""}

{"text": " Financial Tips for Women  Beyonc\u00e9 had it right. Girls run the world; she just left out the word \u201cfinancial.\u201d  With Women's History Month coming to an end, I could think of nothing better than to create a piece for women by a woman. Why would I want to do this?  Women have been paving the way for future generations of women. More than ever before, women are the primary earners or sole earners for their households. Women make most of the spending decisions in their household. Personally, I think this fact alone puts women in a very powerful position. Financial security is the primary goal of money management for women. Although this is also true for men, women place a significantly higher emphasis on that goal.  If you're wondering how I can take these few things and equate that to women running the financial world, think about it like this. Women are bringing in more income. They are in charge of deciding how to best use the money they or their partners are earning. The decision of whether to spend, save, or invest is falling into the hands of women. Money spent in their community is helping local businesses, and women tend to be more intentional in the businesses they support (woman- or black-owned businesses, for example). Women are doing all of this while keeping the focus on financial security for themselves and their families.  We have power. What can we do with it?  1. Set goals  Think about what financial security means to you. Clearly defining this will bring you clarity so you know exactly what you're aiming for. The more you can break down this large goal into smaller chunks, the easier it will be to achieve. I think of it as a set of stairs. Nobody levitates up the stairs; we must take it one step at a time. For example, SaverLife member  Gloria  identified having her own place, being in a job for more than a year, and having an emergency fund as financial stability; she was able to pinpoint three separate goals she can start working toward.  2. Budget, track, and monitor  Before spending any of your money, create a  budget . Consider what expenses you must cover and prioritize other spending. Create a plan that will help you easily track your spending, such as using cash for certain expenses. This will help you stay within the budget you set. Monitor your budget to figure out what does and does not work for you on a regular basis. Then revise your plan as needed.  3. Save  Begin saving toward the financial security goals you have identified. Although it may be easy to dismiss saving for emergencies while working toward other financial goals, having an emergency fund is a proven strategy for success. An emergency fund ensures that when an unexpected expense occurs, you have money to overcome the situation. It keeps you from taking away from your other financial goals to deal with the emergency. You never backtrack in your goals when you think of them that way. If you need some inspiration,  Deirdre  explains how she built a $5,000 emergency fund.  4. Negotiate  Women tend to be accepting and appreciative of whatever salary is offered by a prospective employer and are also less likely to ask for a raise. Before simply accepting the pay and terms an employer brings to you, consider whether you should  negotiate your pay . Increasing the amount you bring home could make a big difference in how quickly you achieve financial security, how you prioritize spending, and how quickly you build your emergency fund.

{"text": " The U.S. government has just started disbursing the stimulus checks it promised to millions of Americans. Questions still linger for many, including whether they need to submit new information in order to get that money.  The government will calculate the  amount of money you receive  based on your adjusted gross income on your 2019 tax return. If you haven't turned in your 2019 tax return yet, it will be based on your 2018 return. However, some people may not have filed a return for either of those years. Meanwhile, others who have low income may have never filed.  The IRS and Treasury Department clarified this week that Social Security beneficiaries will not have to file a tax return in order to get their payments. That is because those people typically receive a 1099 form the government will use instead.  According to the latest information from the IRS, non-filers should use the  Enter Payment Info tool .

{"text": " I think I'm going to receive a large tax refund this year that could help me pay off my debts. If I'm able to pay off all of my debt, should I do it all at once or is it better for my credit to pay it off slowly over time?  Submitted by an anonymous SaverLife member  There are several factors that go into your credit score. A lot of the answer to this question depends on what is currently being reported. In general, if you can pay off all your debt, you should do it! There isn't much better than being debt free and owing no one.  Now, before you pay off all your debt, if you don't have a fully funded emergency fund, you should do that first. Have 3-6 months' worth of expenses in a separate savings account for those rainy days that we all experience.  After this is done, then pay off your debt. If you are now unable to pay it all off, then you need to at least pay each credit line down to one third of its limit. For example, if you have a credit card with a $1,000 limit, pay it down to under $333. This will help your credit score. Do it for each card. How much you owe is the second highest contributing factor to your credit score.  Next, if you haven't started this already, you have to make every remaining payment on time, each and every month. No exceptions. Your payment history is the biggest contributing factor to your credit score. The only way to change this is to start paying on time immediately. As the creditors begin to report your on-time payments, you will see an increase in your score, but again, this will take a while.  Now if you are lucky enough to be able to pay off all your debt  and  fund your emergency fund, then go ahead and do it. Lock up all but one of your cards in a lock box. The one you are keeping out, charge a monthly expense (such as gas or groceries) and then pay if off at the end of the month. This will keep your payment history building. '\""}
{"text": "\u201cHow can you help people who are going to get bumped off their subsidized food and housing because they have assets? Then the federal and state agencies say \u2018Hey, all is well now.\u201d They may be making more, but not enough yet to sustain themselves, landing them right back in poverty. I've seen this happen to one woman who was told she had to work after a certain number of months. So, she did. Then she no longer qualified for the apartment she was in. She got a roomie for her new place. But that income in her house meant she no longer qualified for food stamps. She did what she was supposed to do and now her life is no better and, in fact, worse. So, if you have savings, it can hurt you. It's not right, but that's the way it is.\u201d  Submitted by Jody L.  What you are describing is called \u201casset means testing.\u201d You've touched on a hot topic for those of us in the business of helping people save money. Your story describes the situation that many people are facing if they receive public benefits and try to increase their income or save for emergencies.  What are Asset Limits?  Asset limits determine a person's eligibility for public benefits programs. This is a very complex topic, so let's start with this overview from  Prosperity Now , a nonprofit agency that focuses on the policy solutions that affect poverty:  \u201cMany public benefit programs\u2014such as cash welfare, food assistance and heating assistance\u2014limit eligibility to those with few or no assets. If individuals or families have assets exceeding the state's limit, they must \u201cspend down\u201d longer-term savings in order to receive what is often short-term public assistance. These asset limits, which were originally created to ensure that public resources did not go to \u201casset-rich\u201d individuals, are a relic of entitlement policies that in some cases no longer exist. Cash welfare programs, for example, now focus on quickly moving individuals and families to self-sufficiency, rather than allowing them to receive benefits indefinitely. Personal savings and assets are precisely the kinds of resources that allow people to move off public benefit programs. Yet, asset limits can discourage anyone considering or receiving public benefits from saving for the future.\u201d  We certainly don't want people to take advantage of programs that are intended for those experiencing poverty. But as you noticed, this often becomes a \u201ccatch-22\u201d if you are trying to work your way out of poverty.  How to Save While Receiving Benefits  So, what can you do to better your financial life if you are on public benefits?   Find a local nonprofit agency that understands asset limits and helps people manage the paradox of building financial security while on public benefits.  Know the asset limits in your state and for the benefits you are receiving. This doesn't mean you can't save. You just want to make sure that you don't do harm to your overall financial situation.  There are a growing number of accounts that are not included in asset means testing. But be sure to check each type of account and the relevant benefits. See this  overview of SNAP  for an example.  Be mindful of any financial choices that impact your benefits. This is not to say that you should not take a job that moves you towards your goal. However, if a job doesn't provide benefits (especially medical) and doesn't pay well enough for you to manage without benefits, this may be an indicator that you should keep looking until you find employment that meets your needs.   The good news is that there are many organizations and people in the trenches fighting too. In some states, the efforts to repeal the means test is working. Prosperity Now has a  Scorecard  that tracks how states are doing regarding public benefits and asset limits.

Not only was your merchandise sent to the wrong address, but also your bank refused to remove the charge on your credit card as you requested.

The FCBA protects consumers from unfair billing practices. It provide a mechanisms for addressing billing errors in \u201copen end\u201d credit accounts. It states that a consumer must contact their credit card company within 60 days of a statement.

{"text": " Renting versus owning \u2013 how to determine which is right for you  Choosing whether to own or rent a home is a big decision. The \u201cright\u201d answer for you will be deeply personal, based on a few key considerations that we will explore below.  1. Examine your personal values  A good place to start is with your personal values. What is really important to you in your life? Family? Freedom? Security? How do these values fit with different housing situations?  2. List and prioritize your goals  Next, think about your future. Where do you want to be in five years \u2013 financially and in general? What other financial or life goals do you have? These could include reducing your debt, paying for education, or moving to be closer to family. Where does homeownership rank among those goals?How might it affect your other plans?  3. Weigh the trade-offs of renting versus owning  Every decision has trade-offs \u2013 things you get and things you give up. Both renting and owning come with their own sets of trade-offs.  Owning a home is an important goal for many people. Homeownership has many advantages, but also requires a significant investment of time, energy, and money. It comes with responsibilities and risks.  To help make the choice that is right for you, weigh some of the trade-offs 1  listed below. Think about which would impact you the most and what you care about.  Benefits of Owning: Shelter and Wealth-Building  You may want to own a place that is all yours \u2013 a home that you can modify to fit your needs. Or, you may want to build wealth and increase your net worth over time. For many people, their home is both a shelter and their largest financial asset. When you own a home, you build equity by making monthly payments that reduce your mortgage loan balance. You can also build equity when your home increases in value over time. Equity is the value of your home minus what you owe. While you want this to be a positive number, home equity is not guaranteed.  In summary, here are the benefits you should consider:  Greater control over decisions related to home and living environment Potential to build equity Possible tax benefits Roots in one community and school system No home inspections by landlords or other authorities, greater privacy With a fixed rate mortgage, principal, and interest payments stay the same  Drawbacks of Owning: Maintenance Costs and Less Mobility  Understandably, homeownership is not for everyone. You have to make repairs when needed. You have to change your spending habits, so you can make your monthly payments on time and save for emergencies and repairs. Many people choose to rent so they can have the freedom to move around. Or you may prefer that your landlord has to take care of maintenance and repairs.  Read through these downsides of owning and think about how you value them compared to the benefits of owning.  Risk of property value loss Limited flexibility with relocation Higher upfront costs (compared to renting) Usually higher monthly costs for housing and utility expenses Liability for accidents on the property Responsibilities for home repairs, maintenance, and yard work  Both renting and owning require you to make payments on time. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing your home through eviction or foreclosure.  4. Take a look at your current financial situation.  In this moment, where are you financially? How would you rate your  financial health ?  Your financial health can affect your ability to rent or own a home. Most landlords and all lenders will consider your credit history, for example, when deciding to rent you a place or give you a home loan. Lenders, however, look more carefully at your overall financial health when measuring your ability to buy a home.  You will need a credit score of 620 for a conventional loan or 580 for a government-backed FHA loan to buy a home.  Additionally, you must have enough saved for the upfront costs of homeownership, including the down payment and closing costs. On average, these costs add up to 15 percent of a home's purchase price. Finally, you must show that you earn enough to make the new mortgage payment while continuing to pay your living expenses and debt.  If you wish to buy a home and your financial health does not yet measure up, what would it take to get you financially ready?  5. Get more information  If you are leaning toward homeownership, sign up for a homeownership education class from a  local nonprofit organization . Buying a home can seem like a complicated process, with many people and steps involved. A class can give you the tools and knowledge to successfully navigate the purchase process and take a realistic look at what you can expect from homeownership. The more you know, the easier it will be if you decide that homeownership is right for you.  1  Trade-offs adapted from  Motivational Interviewing  by William R. Miller and Stephen Rollnick. '\""}

{"text": "\\\\xa0  Graduation celebrations are all around us. I think this is a wonderful time to think about what college savings means in your life and for your family.  Find your \u201cwhy\u201d  As exciting as college can be, the financial burden is often high. So take some time now to think about your motivations. Are you saving for your own education, or for a child or grandchild? What are your long-term goals (for yourself or others) and how does college fit in? These questions may seem obvious, but thinking about them ahead of time will help you motivate yourself as well as choose the right college and field of study.  How much time do you have?  Saving for the future begins with the  time horizon , which is the amount of time you have to save. Over this period of time, you'll be adding to your savings, but that money should also be working as hard as you are by earning interest on what you put in.  Your time horizon can help you determine what approach you should take to investing. Do you want to be conservative, moderate, or aggressive in your investments? For example, if you're saving for your 5-year-old to go to college, you can be more aggressive with your investments than if you were saving for a 15-year-old to go to college.  How does saving fit into your plan to pay for college?  Paying for college entirely with savings would be great, but the reality is that most people use a combination of sources to pay for college, including savings, private student loans, federal student loans, scholarships, and grants. There are lots of options and you can potentially avoid a lot of debt through  a combination of other sources .  Now, how are you going to make it happen?  Even if your priority is saving for college, you'll always have competing financial needs, including an emergency fund, expenses, and other goals. So now you need to figure out how your budget can support your priorities.   Create a budget and determine how much you can set aside consistently  Decide which type of account you want to save in. A few options are 529 accounts (Children's Savings Accounts), Roth (retirement), or regular savings. Each option has strengths and weaknesses.  Save, monitor, and evaluate your progress regularly.

{"text": " Buying a home is a big life decision. One of the questions that will come up is how much you should save before starting the home buying process. Here's how to answer that question.  Buying vs. renting a home  The first step is to make sure that you're buying a home for the right reasons. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that  renting is \u201cthrowing money away.\u201d  Although you build equity in the property over time when you own your home, most of your  mortgage  payments in the beginning  go to interest .   In order for buying a home to be a financially beneficial decision, you should plan to stay in the home for at least five years. That's why it's important to consider the possibility of life changes. How secure are your current job and salary? How long are you planning to stay in your area?   One way to look at a rental payment is that you are buying flexibility. If you need to move across the country for family reasons or for an amazing career opportunity, you won't be tethered to a property. This  New York Times calculator  can help you weigh the tradeoffs of buying vs renting.  What can you afford?  The next step is to calculate how much home you can afford to buy using a  home buying calculator . Don't forget to factor in costs such as homeowner's insurance, HOA fees, and maintenance. I usually recommend that my clients refrain from buying the most expensive house they can afford (you probably won't hear that from lenders and realtors!). It's important to leave room for increasing expenses in other areas, especially expenses related to family and children.  Saving for your down payment  Many mortgages require a 20% down payment. This means that you are effectively borrowing 80% of the home's value and paying for the rest outright.  Now that you know your price range, ask yourself how long it would take you to save for a 20% down payment. If it would take longer than you'd like, consider purchasing a less expensive home. Keep in mind, especially if this is your first home purchase, this may not be your forever home. In fact, if the value of your home holds steady or increases, you can use the sale proceeds to help you buy a more expensive home. Another route to consider would be  first-time home buyer programs  and other promotional loans (vary by lender). These loans require down payments as low as 3.5% or no down payment at all. Keep in mind that these loans come with a higher interest rate, a larger mortgage payment (because the interest rate is higher and you are borrowing more of the home's value), and the cost of  private mortgage insurance (PMI) . A low down payment also leaves you more vulnerable to the real estate market. If the value of the home were to fall, then you would immediately be \u201cunderwater.\u201d  Other fees and expenses  Once you know how much you need for the down payment, make sure you set aside enough money for home inspection fees and due diligence (anywhere between $500 and $2,000) and closing costs (2% to 5% of the purchase price). It's also important to have at least six months of expenses saved in your emergency fund. An emergency fund is even more important when you're a homeowner, because if your appliances need to be fixed or replaced, there's no calling the landlord. You own the property, so you have to pay the expense yourself.   Happy home buying! '\""}
{"text": "Do you have any advice for managing money and budgets with a partner who has a different view of spending and saving than I do?  Submitted by anonymous.  Ah, love and money! This can be blissful or stressful. For many people, money can make or break your relationship. It is pretty common to partner with someone who has different perspectives about money. Opposites attract, right?

{"text": " Credit can be a valuable tool in your personal finance arsenal. It allows you to buy things you need and earn points or cash back. It also offers a way to conduct secure transactions online and provides some protections against theft and fraud. But, if not managed properly, it can be a road to high-interest debt that can be difficult to pay off. So, what is the secret to successfully managing what you charge to your credit card?  What Should I Charge to My Credit Card?  The best place to start when deciding what charges to put on your credit card is your budget. If you have already budgeted for an expense and know that you can pay for it, you can put it on your credit card. This will allow you to take advantage of credit card rewards while giving you peace of mind, knowing you can pay your credit card bill in full each month.   Examples of expenses that make sense to put on a credit card include:  groceries gas your monthly Netflix or Apple Music subscription your child's monthly sports or music lessons  These are all items that should already be included in your budget each month. So, instead of using your cash to pay the bill directly, you have the option to use your credit card. You can charge the expense. Then, pay the credit card bill using the money you budgeted for the expense.  What Should I NOT Charge to My Credit Card?  While it can be tempting to put all your monthly bills and expenses on your credit card, it is not necessarily a good idea. If you put expenses you haven't budgeted for on your credit card, you may not have the means to pay them when the bill comes.  Impulse purchases or purchases for friends or family who don't have the money to make the purchase on their own should not be charged to your credit card. In both of these cases you don't have money set aside to pay for the item. So, when the credit card bill comes you will have to find the money to pay for it elsewhere. This can mean taking money budgeted for something else to pay the bill or only making the minimum payment. Neither option puts you in an optimal financial situation.  It can also be tempting to put larger bills like your annual tax payment or a large legal bill on a credit card. If you put your tax payment on your credit card, you will face a service fee that can be nearly 2%. This makes your bill even higher than it already was. And legal bills can be large due to high hourly rates. This can result in high interest charges if you can't pay the credit card bill in full when it comes due.  Should I Use My Credit Card for Emergencies?  Things in life happen that we can't always plan for. And these emergencies often come with expenses. If you have to put more of your credit card than you can pay off in a month due to an emergency, that is okay. Be sure to pay as much as you can each month to minimize interest charges. And pay the bill off in full as soon as you can.  Best Practices for Credit Card Management  Only charge expenses to your credit card that you know you can pay in full when the bill comes. This will help save you money on interest. It will also help you build a good credit score. Your payment history accounts for 35% of your credit score. If you know you can pay your bill on time each month, this will help build up your score.    When calculating your score, credit scoring agencies consider your available credit to account for 30% of your score. They want to see a utilization ratio of 30% or less (lower is better). This means that you aren't carrying a balance of more than 30% of your available credit (across all open credit accounts). Paying your bill off each month will keep your credit usage low and leave you with a larger amount of available credit.  Allowing your budget to dictate your credit spending will help you keep your usage in check. It will also allow you to use credit as a tool to help you out financially instead of allowing it to become a burden that weighs you down. '\""}
{"text": " Submitted by Darlene D.  For many people, homeownership is an essential part of achieving the American Dream. I applaud you for pursuing your home ownership goals.   In my professional opinion, it's never too late to buy a home as long as you can afford the mortgage. With modern health advances, people live much longer. So even at the age of 58, having a 15 or sometimes 30 year mortgage is not out of the question for many people. Also, owning a home has many advantages that add value to your financial and personal life.  By owning a home you build equity through appreciation, meaning your house may increase in value over time. At the same, homeowners get important tax breaks. The U.S. Tax Code lets you deduct the interest you pay on your mortgage, your property taxes, as well as some of the costs involved in buying your home. In addition, building equity in your home is a ready-made savings plan. And when you sell, you can generally take up to $250,00 ($500,000 for a married couple) as gain without owing any federal income tax.

{"text": " You may have heard that there are only two kinds of people: those who pay interest and those who earn it. In reality, we all likely end up occupying both sides of that equation.  The first thing to know about borrowing money and paying interest is that how much you pay depends on your credit score. Your credit score is kind of like your financial report card \u2013 it demonstrates to creditors your reliability as a borrower. The higher your score, the more desirable you are as a borrower, and the lower your interest rates will be.   What's a good interest rate for home loans?  According to  NerdWallet , the average is 4.1% for 30-year  mortgages  and 3.6% for 15-year mortgages as of October 16th. If your  credit score  is Good (670-739), aim for 3.75% for a 30-year mortgage or 3% for a 15-year mortgage. If your credit score is Fair (580-669), aim for around 4.75% for a 30-year and 3.125% for a 15-year. Visit NerdWallet's  comparison tool  for personalized estimates. Getting approved for a mortgage with a Poor credit score is very difficult. Work to increase your credit score or look into  FHA mortgages , which are more accessible because they are insured by the government.  What's a good interest rate for a car loan?  According to  Bankrate , the average interest rate for a new car loan is just over 5% for borrowers with a Good credit score, 7.91% for borrowers with a Fair credit score, and 12.17% for borrowers with a Poor credit score. For used car loans, average rates are 6.38%, 10.91%, and 16.78% respectively. According to  NerdWallet , the best rate would be around 3% for those with Good or Excellent credit.   What's a good credit card interest rate?  You may have noticed that credit cards charge much higher interest rates than car and home loans. That's because car and home loans are secured debt \u2013 the car and home pose as collateral for the loans. If you decide not to make your payments, the bank repossesses the property and sells it to recoup as much of the loan as possible. Credit card debt, on the other hand, is unsecured debt. If you decide to stiff your credit card company, their only recourse is to sue you and hope to recover enough from you to make their efforts worthwhile. This makes it much more difficult for credit card companies to collect unpaid debts. Therefore, they demand a higher interest rate to compensate for the higher risk.   According to  NerdWallet , credit card interest rates range from 12.9% for individuals with Good or Excellent credit to 24.9% for those with Fair credit.  Credit Karma  estimates your credit score and lets you shop for loans and credit cards based on your credit profile.  What's a good savings account interest rate?  Now let's talk about the more fun side of the interest equation \u2013 earning interest. Savings accounts allow you to set aside money for later while maintaining access to it when you need it. Banks compensate you for providing capital to them by paying you interest. Online banks tend to pay the highest interest rates, because the lack of brick and mortar branches decreases their costs. According to  NerdWallet , the going rate for savings accounts at these banks is around 2%.   What's a good CD interest rate?  Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are offered by banks and credit unions. These accounts pay you interest in exchange for your agreement to leave money in the account for a specific period of time. According to  NerdWallet , a good interest rate for a one-year CD is 2.25%, and a good rate for a 3-year CD is 2.35%. You can use their  comparison tool  to shop for offerings in your area. '\""}
{"text": "\u201cMy debt from an unpaid urgent care bill has been sent to a collection agency. What is the best way to go about paying off this debt?\u201d  Submitted by Jessica J.  Medical debt is a huge financial stressors for many people. Taking action early is the best way to get it under control.  Double-check your debt  Before you agree to anything, make sure the debt is yours and is accurate. If it has been sent to collections, there are likely additional fees. Dig a bit deeper to clarify the actual amount of the outstanding debt and the fees associated with collections. This information will be helpful if you have to negotiate.  Negotiate and plan  Once you have confirmed the debt is yours, negotiate. Let them know how much you can afford to pay. Don't feel pressured to accept their first request. Having an accurate budget that includes debt repayment can help you avoid promising more than you can pay. When you call to negotiate, have a clear solution that works for you (i.e. I can pay $XX each month for XX months) and be sure you choose a due date that will not cause unnecessary pressure on your monthly cash flow.  Get it in writing  Get the agreement in writing! This is crucial. If the debt is in collections, it is impacting your credit score. Request (and require) a written agreement that when the debt is paid they will remove the delinquency from your credit report or change the status to paid in full.  The CFPB (Consumer Finance Protection Bureau) has  sample letters and action steps  to help you through this process. If you need additional help, contact a local nonprofit credit counseling agency.  Keep saving!  As always, I encourage you to keep your saving plan (even if the amount is small) on track as you pay down the debt. '\""}
{"text": " Let's take a look at IRS.gov for some tools you may find helpful as you file your taxes!  Where's My Tax Refund?  You can check your refund status on  irs.gov  to know whether the IRS has received your refund and is processing it. You can also read more about  how to track your refund .  Download Tax Records or Transcripts  The IRS website can provide your tax records or transcripts. Note that this isn't a photocopy of your return. If you want that, you have to mail in  Form 4506 . There is a fee for a copy of your actual tax return. Fortunately, tax transcripts are often free (for the most recent ones) and most of us can get them online. There are several different versions, so if you aren't sure which version you need for a particular year I recommend downloading or printing all of them that are available for the year in question. If you can't get original tax documents, the wage and income transcript is the one that is most often needed to fix a prior year tax return or to file a return for a year that was missed.  The thing to remember about this transcript is that for many documents, such as W-2s, it only shows the information that is pertinent to the Federal government. So it may not have all the information you would need for a state return. Also, note that the Wage and Income transcript for the current year tax information may not be available until July. So a 2020 W-2 that is required to be filed in 2021 may not be shown on a transcript until July of 2021. You can  request tax transcripts and get more information .  Get Answers to Your Tax Questions with the Interactive Tax Assistant  The IRS has provided the  Interactive Tax Assistant  to help answer tax questions for your particular situation. You can search for your question or choose from the list of common questions. One example is: Is my Tip Income Taxable? Most of the topics take about 15 minutes to go through the assistant, with you answering guiding questions to determine the answer for you.  The Interactive Tax Assistant is a good way to check if what someone tells you is true or if what you are doing on your tax return is right. But it isn't foolproof, so consult IRS publications and instructions or consult a tax professional if there is any doubt.  Tax Publications and Instructions  I know most of us don't like digging into tax code to figure out how to fill out forms, but sometimes that is the best place to find your answer. IRS.gov provides a huge number of forms, publications, and instructions in pdf and html format for free. You can also order printed copies if you prefer.  See all IRS Forms, Instructions, and Publications.  IRS.gov is full of information you may find useful. There is even tax news if you'd like to read it! Often going straight to this source will give you the most accurate information, so don't be afraid to use it. After all, your taxes paid for it. '\""}

{"text": " First of all, congratulations! Your teen has their first paying job. This is a milestone and a time where they'll learn new things about work, life, money, and themselves. This is an excellent time to teach foundational principles and practical budgeting. Your teen can also earn more financial independence.   Save. Spend. Give.  All the things we can do with income boils down to these three essentials.  Save : Setting aside money, which will be spent in the future.  Spend : Buying items or services to meet current needs and wants.  Give : This includes gifts to charities and religious or church-based giving.  Your Teen's Money Style  Your teen (and you) likely naturally lean towards being a spender, saver or giver. This is your  money style . It's important to encourage balance. If you have a child who really just wants to spend money, help them see the benefit of saving for a future need or want. Perhaps you have a tender-hearted giver or a devoted saver-only. They'll need your perspective to understand it's also healthy to spend for their own needs and wants. Meet your teen where they are at and help them grow from there.  Set Goals for Each Category  Help them to set written goals for each category. They can ask themselves these questions.  Save : What future needs or wants do I need to plan for before they happen?  Spend : What current needs or wants do I have? Give : What values or causes do I want to support?  Practice Budgeting  Every month, before the next month begins, your teen should estimate how much income they expect to earn that month. Then reflect on their written goals and document how much of their money will they save, spend, or give. This can be very simple at first, and can expand as the teen earns more or has more goals. If they work more or less during the month, they can adjust their simple budget to show what actually happened. Here's a sample:  Jamie's Budget, April 2021  Income : 10 hours X $12 an hour babysitting = $120        Expense : Where is it going? Save 70% of earnings ($84) for my goal of $240 for an art class in July 2021. Spend 20% of earnings ($36) on one new book & one movie with friends. Give 10% of earnings ($12) for charity or church. This adds up to $120!  You can increase financial independence and support the practical skill of budgeting by giving them more responsibility for their discretionary spending. Discretionary spending is the fun stuff: special clothing, entertainment, etc. They'll get to practice on a small scale the decisions and choices that grown-ups make when they have limited amounts of money, but many wants. Your child may have to choose between a new clothing item and an evening out with friends (post-pandemic). They may have to decide whether to buy something now at a higher price, or shop around for a sale price. They'll have to prioritize, which is a key life skill.  Start Simple  These tips are just the beginning, but it is helpful to start simple. Your teen can build a solid, personal finance foundation, through balancing  Save, Spend, and Give , setting goals that address both future and current desires, and monthly budgeting. '\""}

{"text": " Have you ever wondered what the difference is between a Marketplace plan and Obamacare? Good news: They're one and the same.   The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, is the landmark healthcare reform legislation. It became the law of the land in the U.S. after President Barack Obama signed it in March 2010. The ACA primarily ensures that more people have access to more affordable and more comprehensive health insurance. It does this in a number of ways.  One of the biggest ways that the healthcare law expanded health insurance coverage to more people was by creating a way for people to shop for their own, high-quality health plans through something known as the  Health Insurance Marketplace . The law also guaranteed that people could get most forms of preventive care at no cost, and that people could get the coverage they needed regardless of pre-existing conditions. Plans purchased by individuals for themselves and their families from the Health Insurance Marketplace are known as Marketplace plans. Some people also refer to these kinds of plans as Obamacare.

{"text": " Hi, I'm Saundra Davis, financial coach here at SaverLife. Today we are going to talk about one of the biggest financial stressors in many of our financial lives: debt.  The \u201cNo Judgment Zone\u201d  So, the very first thing is remember the \u201cno judgment zone.\u201d Everything that you have done in your financial past that you're not very proud of, this is the time to remember to be gentle with yourself, and debt is often one of those areas. It doesn't matter what you've done before. What matters is what are you going to do today.  Know Your Debt  One of the things we can begin with is knowing exactly how much debt we have. Not only the total amount, but the individual debts: how much, when it's due, and how much we're paying in interest on each one of those debts.  Balance Debt and Savings  Some of you might be tempted to stop saving while you're trying to pay off your debt. I would encourage you to build your debt reduction budget with saving in mind. In other words, do a little bit of both. You might have to reduce your savings, but I would encourage you not to give up on it completely.  Budget for Debt Reduction  So build your debt reduction plan by identifying who you owe, when the debt is due, and how much you can afford to pay. Make sure that your budget includes debt reduction as well as saving to make sure that you don't lose the habit of saving that you've worked so hard to achieve. And when thinking about your financial goals overall, keep debt and saving in mind.  What are you saving for?  Learn more about debt reduction strategies. '\""}
{"text": " Before opening a savings account, think about why you and your child are saving money. Here are some common reasons  Pay for  future education expenses Help your child manage the money they make from their job  Give your child a lump sum of money when they graduate from high school  Your reason for saving the money will help you decide where to save the money. There are three main options that may be a good fit for you  529 College Savings Account  If you're saving money for educational expenses, consider an education savings account, like a 529 plan. A 529 is a savings account specifically for educational expenses. You can invest the money you put into a 529 plan. If you use the money for a  qualified educational  cost, then all of the money is typically tax-free. Depending on the state you live in, the amount you put into the 529 plan may be state tax-deductible. You also maintain control over the account.  Benefits of a 529 Account  The money gets special tax treatment by the IRS 529 plans owned by custodial parents generally don't heavily impact your child's financial aid eligibility  Downsides of a 529 Account  You are limited to using the funds for education-related expenses You are limited in what you can invest inside a 529 plan  If you want the flexibility to use the money for anything, then a savings account may be a better fit.  Joint Bank Account with Your Child  These accounts typically require you to open the account with your kids. Both you and your child will own the account. This option gives you the ability to manage the account until your child is mature enough to handle the account alone. Your child can use the funds in the account generally at any time for any reason.\\\\xa0A joint account may be an option for a parent with a working child who wants to both save and spend the money in the account.   Benefits of a Joint Bank Account  Joint ownership so you can manage the account The child has access to the account   Downsides of a Joint Bank Account  You're responsible for what your child does in the account Possible financial aid eligibility impact  UTMA/UGMA Custodial Accounts  The Uniform Transfers To Minors Act (UTMA) allows you to put more assets into the account, like real estate. The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) limits what you can put into the account to mostly cash and investments like stocks and bonds. The account is managed by an adult on behalf of a minor.\\\\xa0The minor doesn't have access to the account until they are an adult. UTMA/UGMA may be a consideration if you want to save (or invest) money to give to your child once they are an adult.  Benefits of a UTMA/UGMA Custodial Account  Lots of investment options Can use the money for any purpose  Downsides of a UTMA/UGMA Custodial Account  At a certain age (can vary by state), the money belongs to the child Possible financial aid impact   To recap, before opening an account to save money for your child, decide the purpose of the savings.

Some say that you shouldn't use credit cards at all, while others say that credit cards can be a helpful financial tool when used wisely. I tend to be in the latter group. I want people to be confident using all financial instruments (banking, matched savings, debt, etc.) and I want them to know how to choose what is best for their financial goals.

{"text": " It's only natural to want to know the status of your tax refund. Is it being worked on? When will your refund reach your checking account? When will your refund check arrive? Many people rely on a tax professional or tax software to get this information. But you can also go straight to the IRS!  How Long Does It Take to Get My Refund?  Before we talk about that, let's talk about how long a refund typically takes. The IRS says that most refunds are received within 21 days for electronic tax filings. In some cases, it can take longer. If the IRS needs more information or flags your return to ensure that you are the valid taxpayer, this process can be delayed. In both of these cases, the IRS will send you a letter letting you know what else they need.  Mailed-in tax returns typically takes 6 to 8 weeks to process. Amended tax returns (ones that you change or correct) can take up to 16 weeks to process. For 2019 amendments, the IRS started to allow electronic filing of amendments, but it can still take up to 16 weeks even if filed electronically.  What Else Can Cause My Tax Return to Be Delayed?  The most common delay is for those that receive the  Earned Income Tax Credit  or the Additional Child Tax Credit. Tax returns with these credits are put on hold until February 15th. The reason for this delay is concerns over fraud \u2013 not by you, but by criminals. Let's say a criminal files a tax return before you and claims your children as dependents. Since the IRS holds the return, it gives you more time to try to file yours, realize someone else has claimed your children, and inform the IRS what has happened. This process helps the IRS ensure that the tax refund is going to the right person. If you claim either or both of these credits, the IRS may not update the status of your refund for several days after February 15th.  How to Check the Status of Your Tax Return  Knowing all this, you can check your refund status for current filings on  IRS.gov . To get the status you will need your Social Security Number, your filing status, and the refund amount. You can also use  IRS2Go , the official IRS mobile app, to check your refund.  If you'd prefer to use a phone, you can get automated tax refund information at this number: 1-800-829-4477. And the general line for IRS questions is 1-800-829-1040. Usually calling this line when your refund status indicates that it is processing will not get you any additional information. If you submit an amended return, you can get the status on the  IRS website . Note that the IRS says it can take up to 3 weeks to show in the system.   Waiting for a tax refund can be frustrating, but I hope you can use this information to stay up to date and know when to expect your refund. '\""}
{"text": " It can be confusing to figure out who you can claim as our dependent on your Federal tax return. It's typically clear whether or not you can claim a child as a qualifying child. The other kind of dependent is a qualifying relative (and they don't always have to be a relative). This can get a bit more complicated.  There are 7 dependency tests to pass in order to claim a qualifying relative.   1. Dependent Taxpayer Test  To claim a person as a dependent, they cannot be eligible to be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return.   2. Joint Return Test  Usually a person cannot be your dependent if they filed a joint tax return with their spouse. There are some exceptions to this rule. So if you think you should be able to claim someone whom has filed (or will file) a joint tax return, consider doing more research.   3. Citizen or Resident Test  The dependent must be either a US citizen, US National, US resident alien, or a resident of Mexico or Canada. An adopted child passes the this test if the child lived with the taxpayer all year and if the taxpayer is a US citizen or US national.   4. Relationship or Member of Household Test  The following pass this test:  A son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of these. A brother, sister, half brother, half sister, or son or daughter of any of these. A father, mother, or a direct ancestor or sibling of either of them. A stepbrother, stepsister, stepfather, stepmother, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law. Any other person (other than the spouse) who lived with the taxpayer all year as a member of the taxpayer's household if the relationship does not violate local law. There are some reasonable absences allowed.  5. Not a Qualifying Child Test  The dependent must not be the qualifying child of any other taxpayer for the year.   6. Gross Income Test  The dependent must have a gross income of less than $4,300 in 2020. This includes all income that is not exempt from tax. This is important to note because some people have income that is exempt from tax.   7. Support Test  The taxpayer must provide over half of the dependent's total support during the year. This doesn't apply to certain dependents of divorced or separated parents or if a multiple support agreement applies, or if the dependent is under the rule for kidnapped children.   I know this is a lot to consider for something that seems like it should be simple. But many people have households that are more complicated than a parent or two and their children. And if you are in one of those households, I encourage you to take a close look at who can and can't be a qualifying relative, because under current tax law a qualifying relative qualifies most taxpayers to receive the $500 credit for other dependents. You can  read more and use the IRS's Interactive Tax Assistant tool .  But one word of warning. Before claiming a dependent, make sure you understand the impact claiming an individual as a dependent may have on any benefits they receive from Federal, state, and local governments.  '\""}
{"text": "I always like to say that there are only three things you can do to change your financial situation: make more, spend less, or a combination of the two. But making more money can be easier said than done. It could mean finding a new job, gaining additional skills, or working more hours. Let's dive into one way you can make more money: negotiate a raise.  Know Your Why  If you've been in SaverLife for a while, you're familiar with my constant refrain of \u201cknow your why!\u201d It's important to go back to your fundamental goals and the roots of your financial desires. If you've been thinking about asking for a raise, is it because you don't feel that your work is being sufficiently valued? Is it really about money, or is there something else going on at work that makes you feel undervalued?  What will this additional money do for your financial life and allow you to accomplish? Get specific! You can consult a  pay raise calculator  to see how a raise will change your monthly and annual pay. And don't forget that earning more money may put you in a different  tax bracket .  Know Your Worth  When you talk to your supervisor, you'll need to present a reason you think you deserve more money \u2013 not just the reason you need the extra money. Have you been taking on additional responsibility, working longer hours, training other employees? Your pay should reflect your value to the company, so if you have more experience or responsibilities than you did when you were hired, it might be appropriate to ask for more money.  To start brainstorming about how you can frame this conversation, try doing a  SWOT analysis , which helps you identify strengths that you can highlight. Make a few notes on the accomplishments you're proud of, successes you've had at work, and the impact you've had on your team or company.  Here are some important questions to have answers for:   What is the business case for increasing your compensation? In other words, how is keeping you happy beneficial to their business bottom line?  What is the standard pay raise in your industry? Many industries have a standard of 3% annual raises.  How does your pay rate compare to other companies in your industry?   Know Your When  Timing matters. If your employer is stressed or trying to finish a project, it's not the best time to negotiate a raise. The ideal time would be after a big company success where you played a part in the positive outcome. And of course, a performance review is usually a neutral time to have this conversation. Your employer may even be expecting you to ask.  Know Your Bottom Line  Your employer may say no. What next? Have a plan for how you want to proceed. If you intend to stay even without the raise, ask what you need to do differently to get a raise in the future. What expectations are not being met? If you intend to leave if you don't receive the raise, be mindful that you may need a reference from your current employer.  ***  If you're on the fence about asking for a raise, remember that you have more leverage than you might think. A  survey from PayScale  found that only 37% of workers have negotiated to increase their pay, but of those who asked for a raise, 70% received one. '\""}
{"text": " How do you get out of an upside down car loan when you have bad credit and no one is willing to refinance?  Submitted by Nichole B.  You have touched on a hot button for me! In the early 90s, I had a car that was so upside down my grandchildren would be paying the loan. I'd had a few years of no income while I was in school and my credit was trashed.  The fact is, there are no great options. Once there is negative equity (meaning you loan is more than the value of your car) on a vehicle, it doesn't go away.   Option 1: Ride It Out  For the most part, you will have to tough it out until you can pay the car down enough to get rid of the negative equity. Once you pay the car down, it will be much easier to find a lender who is willing to refinance, hopefully at a lower interest rate.  Option 2: Trade in the Car  The other option would be to trade in the car for a different vehicle. This option, more often than not, can create even more negative equity (making you more upside down), so you have to be patient. Choose a car that will outlast the new loan and find a \u201csmokin' deal.\u201d This is most commonly called a \u201crollover\u201d and your lender may be able to lower your interest rate/ monthly payment. You'll still be on the hook for what you owed in the previous loan because the old loan is \u201crolled\u201d into the new loan.  Here's the bright side. I found a deal on a car that I could count on for years to come. I bought that new car and my interest rate was outrageous. The price was nearly twice the amount the car would cost if I wasn't upside down. In two years, I refinanced with a credit union (yep\u2026 you know me!) and got a great rate. I paid off that car and am still driving it today.  In the short run, that was a very painful financial situation that I turned into a good situation. My car has more than 350,000 miles on it and I haven't paid a car note in 10 years.  Financial mistakes are not fatal.  Learn the lesson and make choices that are in alignment with your long term goals.  Photo by\\\\xa0 Peter Fazekas\\\\xa0 from\\\\xa0 Pexels '\""}
{"text": " If you are a teacher or work for an educational service and also have federal student loans, you may qualify for Teacher Loan Forgiveness.  Requirements for Teacher Loan Forgiveness Eligibility  To qualify for Teacher Loan Forgiveness, you must have direct loans or FFEL Program loans borrowed after Oct. 1, 1998. You also need to be employed full-time for five complete and consecutive years as a highly qualified teacher. Additionally, the school where you teach must be an elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency. It must serve low-income students. See a  full directory of schools and agencies  that qualify under this program.  What is a Highly Qualified Teacher?  You must be a highly qualified teacher to be eligible for Teacher Loan Forgiveness. Highly qualified teachers have a bachelor's degree and are fully certified to teach in their state. If you received a temporary, emergency, or provisional license, the time that you teach with that license does not qualify.  How Much Loan Forgiveness Do I Qualify For?  You can qualify for different amounts of loan forgiveness depending on what subjects you teach. All teachers can receive up to $5,000 in forgiveness. But you can qualify for up to $17,500 if you teach math or science at the secondary level or if you teach special education at the elementary or secondary level.  How to Apply for Teacher Loan Forgiveness  After five consecutive years of teaching, fill out the  Teacher Loan Forgiveness Application  and submit it to your loan servicer. If you have multiple federal loan servicers, submit a form to each of them.  You can qualify for both Teacher Loan Forgiveness and  Public Service Loan Forgiveness , just not during the same time period. This means that after you complete five consecutive years of teaching for Teacher Loan Forgiveness, you would complete an additional ten years (120 payments) for Public Service Loan Forgiveness '\""}
{"text": " The key to creating a budget is finding what works to help you manage your money. Many budgeting tools exist, but you need to find what works for you. Managing your money is about choices \u2013 choosing how to earn, spend, save, and keep track of your money. A personalized, realistic budget can help you set priorities, direct spending, and manage your cash flow. While budgeting tools and practices vary from person to person, there are generally six steps that most people take to create a budget. Keep in mind, it is really more of an art than a science.  Step 1: Explore your goals and values  What's important to you? What is your top financial or life goal? If you need some help, identifying your goals, use  this worksheet . Your goals will help you create a budget that affords your current obligations, activities you enjoy, and future plans.  Step 2: Gather and track your financial information  You need to understand what is happening now with your money, including income, expenses, and savings. What is coming in? What's going out? What's stored away? Most people know their regular earnings and expenses, but may not have a clear picture of irregular or day-to-day expenditures. To get a better sense of your cash flow, carefully track your income and expenses for at least 30 days.  Determining your income \u2013 the money you and your family receive on a regular basis from work, investments, public benefits, or business sales \u2013 might be relatively easy. For budgeting purposes, use your net (or take-home) monthly income after taxes and other payroll deductions have been taken out. Collect information related to income, such as paystubs, that show how much you bring in and how often from all sources. Calculate your total. If you prefer,  use a worksheet  to make sure you're capturing everything.  Gathering expenses \u2013 anything you spend your money on \u2013 can be more involved. You have some expenses that are fixed and regular, such as rent, and others that change day-to-day, such as groceries or entertainment. To closely track all expenses for at least 30 days, you can gather monthly bills, collect receipts, use a notebook,  use a worksheet , use an online budgeting tool, and/or review your bank and credit card statements. Choose the method that works best for you. For irregular, expected expenses, such as car maintenance, an insurance premium, or car registration, gather past information or make estimates. After 30 days, gather all of your expense records (bills, receipts, bank statements, notebooks), categorize (housing expenses, food expenses), and then add up your total monthly expenses.  Also, note how much you already have set aside by checking your savings balance.  Step 3: Assess your current financial situation  What's your bottom line? After you have all of your financial information in order, subtract your expenses from your monthly income to see what is left over (also known as your bottom line) to spend or save. If it's helpful,  use a worksheet . In some cases, your bottom line might be negative, meaning that you are spending more than your current income. Consider what immediate changes you can make to bring in more, spend less, or do both.  If you have some money left over each month, consider whether it's enough to cover essentials, money set aside for emergencies, your financial goals, and expenses that are important for you, such as fitness or entertainment. If not (and that is usually the case), you'll have to make some changes to current spending, saving, and earning habits. Nearly always, reaching financial goals requires us to change our financial habits. How much exactly do you need to set aside each month to be on track with your current situation and future plans?  Step 4: Make changes to how you manage your money  From your assessment, you have a dollar amount in mind of how much you need to adjust your current financial habits. To change your bottom line, there are only three changes you can make: increase your income, spend less, or do both. Bringing in more income could include turning a hobby into a business or second job, maximizing your tax benefits, accessing public benefits, or selling items you do not use.  For reducing expenses, move from general to specific changes. First, note your essentials and priorities. You can use a  tool to prioritize . Then, think about your least important expenses. What costs too much? What could you change? Spend some time looking at the big picture. Brainstorm, and get creative. After that, go through specific spending categories, such as transportation or insurance, and consider changes. Could you carpool or take public transportation more often to save on gas? Could you shop around for a lower cost insurance plan? Keep drilling down until your expenses are where you need them to be. Then integrate the changes into your budget.  Step 5: Create your budget  By now, you've done all of the hard work. You have gathered your income and expenses, and you have made changes to habits. It's time to commit to your new plan by putting it in writing. To make your written budget, you can use  a worksheet , an app, a spreadsheet, or a notebook.  It is important that you find a tool that works for you to map out your new plan for saving and spending.  Step 6: Follow, track, and adjust as needed  Follow your plan as best you can and continue to track what you actually spend using a record-keeping system that works for you. At least every month, reconcile your planned budget versus your actual expenses. Your findings may help guide you to adjust your budget or your spending habits. Remember, a budget is your plan to manage your money in ways that work for you! '\""}
{"text": " The IRS  announced  that this Wednesday, May 13th, 9am PT (noon ET) is the deadline for many people to enter their direct deposit info into their  Get My Payment  portal. If you  qualify for a stimulus payment  and haven't received it yet, provide your direct deposit information to get your funds faster.  Who needs to provide their direct deposit information?  Wednesday's deadline seems to only apply if you filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return, but didn't include direct deposit information. If you miss this deadline, you'll still receive your payment if you qualify. It will come via check sometime in the next few months.  What if I'm not required to file taxes?  Even if you're not required to file taxes, you can still expedite your stimulus payment. Just enter your direct deposit info into the  Non-Filer: Enter Payment Info Here  tool. So far, the IRS hasn't set a deadline for non-filers to enter their payment info.  You aren't required to file a tax return if your annual income was less than $12,200 ($24,400 if filing jointly). Even if it's not required by law, it may benefit you to file your taxes anyway. You may qualify for refundable tax credits like the EITC or the Additional Child Tax Credit and receive a refund.   It's also important for young adults who are newly financially independent of their parents to file taxes. This will establish your \u201cindependent\u201d status with the IRS. Even if your parents help you out financially, if you're 19-24, the IRS likely sees you as independent. The main exception is full-time students whose parents pay more than half of their expenses.  How to File Your Taxes for Free  If you're eligible for the stimulus payment and haven't filed your 2019 tax returns, I recommend that you do so as soon as possible. When you file, be sure to include your direct deposit info. If your income is $69,000 or less, you can use brand-name tax prep software for free through  IRS Free File . Code for America is also partnering with free tax prep sites to offer  help from IRS-certified volunteers  for free.  File your taxes as soon as possible to get your stimulus payments and any other tax refunds that you qualify for.

{"text": " There is strength in numbers! This is especially true when you're trying to reach your goals and change behaviors. Weight Watchers uses this principle to support healthy eating, and Alcoholics Anonymous uses it to encourage sober living. Emerging research shows that peer support can increase your confidence and sense of control. Social support also makes you more likely to succeed in changing your habits. By participating in social savings strategies, you can capture these same benefits with your financial goals and savings habits.  Socializing your financial goals and savings strategies is when you get together with people to support each other and fulfill your aspirations. These peer support groups can be loose and informal with your friends to help each other save. They can also be formal and structured with agreed-upon savings amounts. Social strategies can include technology, but they don't need to.  Let's explore some options for getting social with your financial goals and savings strategies. These strategies can help you save more by providing mutual accountability, shared support, and peer learning.  Vision board party  A vision board is a collage of visual images or words that represent your financial goals or dreams. You can make one by hand using magazine cutouts, photos, or stickers on a poster board. You can make one digitally through a website like Pinterest. Creating a financial vision board with your friends can be fun. But it's also a tangible way to see and support each others' goals and plan how to achieve them.  Savings Club  Social savings clubs are small groups of people with similar savings goals who commit to gathering together and regularly saving a specific amount for a period of time.  For example, if members of your group are saving $600 for an emergency savings fund over six months, each individual commits to save $100 by each monthly meeting. Alternatively, your group could commit to doing something like the 52-week money challenge where you gradually increase your savings by a dollar a week over a whole year.  Lending Circle  Lending circles are when a small group of friends or family saves together and lends each other money. The group agrees on a monthly amount that each member contributes. Each month, a new member of the lending circle receives the \u201cloan\u201d until everyone in the group gets paid.  If a lending circle has 10 members who contribute $100 each month, each member receives $1,000 over 10 months.  Financial Support Group  In a financial support group, members provide each other with emotional support. They share information and personal experiences related to financial goals, saving habits, and relationships with money. Peer-led financial circles are collaborative and creative experiences that can increase self-awareness and self-confidence, and in turn your financial health.  Socially-Networked Savings Account  Online savings accounts like  SmartyPig  allow you to announce your financial goals to the world, network with other savers, and ask for help from friends and family.  \u2013  The idea behind social saving is that the more support you get, the more successful you will be in reaching your financial goals. You can mix and match these options or get creative with other possibilities. Many studies (as well as my own personal experiences) show that you're more likely to complete a goal if someone is holding you accountable for it and providing you with emotional and practical support. Saving can be more fun and meaningful when you involve your friends and family on your financial journey! '\""}
{"text": " Creating a plan for how you will pass on money or other assets (anything you own) is called  estate planning . Many people think that if they don't have a lot of money or assets (like homes, cars, and jewelry), they don't have an \u201cestate.\u201d But the fact is we all have an estate.  How you transfer your estate to the next generation is often referred to as a financial legacy. This legacy is the foundation for building inter-generational wealth.   The Emotional Side of Estate Planning  Transferring wealth is practical, but it is also an emotional process.  You have to consider something that most people don't like to think about \u2013 what will happen to your family or heirs when you are no longer here. It can be sad to think about that reality, but the real question at stake is how we prepare ourselves and our families to continue to build on the financial wealth you have created.  Kathleen Burns Kingsbury, a wealth expert, suggests  the following questions  to ask yourself as you are preparing your estate:  What lessons did you learn from your parents about money and finance that you would like to pass onto your heirs? What family values would you like to pass down to the next generation and how do you plan on communicating this family legacy? What concerns do you have about your adult children when it comes to inheriting and managing the family wealth?  Simple Will or Trust?  There's no right answer for everyone for whether a simple will or trust is better. It all depends on your circumstances. I recommend that you start by  learning about your options . (Note that this site sells products and services. I am not recommending that you buy anything there; it's just a good place to compare your options.)  Once you decide what you need, consider the most appropriate way to get the service, including pro bono financial planners, nonprofit agencies, or paid financial or legal experts (usually an attorney for estate planning).  Beneficiary Designations  You should designate someone as your beneficiary for all of your accounts, including your employer retirement accounts as well as your checking and savings accounts. Make sure you keep these designations up to date if you have life changes (like if you move, marry, divorce, or have children). Do you  really  want your ex to get all of your stuff?  On a bank account, this is sometimes called a TOD (transfer on death) instead of beneficiary designation. It means that your beneficiary will be able to access the account without the intervention of a court or  probate .  If you have children under the age of 18, you should have at minimum a simple will with guardianship arrangements (need to do this? Go ahead\u2026I'll wait). The guardian may be the person you designate for the accounts if you are leaving funds for them to care for your dependents.  If you have insurance policies, keep good, updated records about the policies, the beneficiary, and the claim forms.  Record-Keeping  Keep all your records in one place and make a list (written and digital) of all of the above. Let your beneficiary know where that document is so that it's easy to find.  What to Do Now  I know this all might sound like a lot to do. Well, it is! Estate planning is a big, important topic and I encourage you to learn more before making decisions.   But there are a few things that I encourage you to do as soon as possible:  Guardianship : If you have minor children, make sure you've arranged guardianship for them. Decide now who you want to care for your dependents and talk to them. Get a document establishing this in place even if you still need to work on other issues. Records : List your accounts! Know and list every bank, investment, retirement, employer retirement, and insurance account.  Don't let perfection get in the way of progress. Gather all your documents and communicate your wishes to the person who will be in charge of executing your plan.  This is a great time to think about what is most important to you. Then take steps to make sure that everything you have worked hard for will be passed along according to your wishes! '\""}
{"text": " The goal of deductions is to lower the amount of taxable income the IRS will use when calculating the amount of tax you owe. The decision of whether to itemize your deductions or take the standard deduction comes down to one question.  Which deduction is bigger and will lower your tax burden more?  Currently, the standard deduction for a single filer is $12,200 and for married filing jointly it's $24,400. If your itemized deductions equal more than these, you will want to itemize using form Schedule A.  What can I itemize?  Listed on Schedule A, itemized deductions include:  real estate property taxes home mortgage interest charitable contributions state and local income taxes casualty and theft losses  There is a section on the form for Other itemized Deductions.

In 2019, 25 million taxpayers received a total of $63 billion in EITC funds. The average amount a family received was just over $2,400. It's a good chunk of money, and many families count on it to make ends meet.  How the EITC is different this year  Did you earn less in 2020 than 2019? You could qualify for a bigger tax refund! Congress approved a new \u201clookback rule\u201d which means you can use either your 2019 or 2020 income on your taxes to get the biggest refund possible this year. Make sure you have your 2019 tax return available when you do your taxes this year.  If you receive the EITC, how does unemployment income impact that credit?   You may have heard me say this before regarding many personal finance questions, but the answer is:  It depends.  In 2020, a lot of Americans received unemployment, particularly after the CARES Act extended unemployment benefits.   Note : This discussion assumes you are qualified to receive EITC.  Explore whether or not you are qualified.  Here's the bad news. Unemployment income will not increase the EITC you receive, because the tax code does not recognize unemployment income as earned income. And if you have received unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic, you may owe taxes on that income. Check with your tax preparer to make sure.  Being unemployed in 2020 may reduce the EITC you receive. Knowing exactly how unemployment income will affect your EITC depends upon your specific circumstances.  How to calculate your exact EITC  To calculate precise numbers, use the  IRS EITC Assistant . To use this tool, you'll need to know your income and your tax withholding or taxes paid. You'll also have to know any expenses or adjustments to your income that may occur. Having your prior year tax return available may be helpful.  Another option is to find a 2020 EITC calculator online. Just be aware, not all calculators differentiate between different types of income. So if you do have earned income and unemployment, they may not give an accurate number, depending on what side of the EITC \u201ccurve\u201d you are on.  It's a lot of information, and there are many nuances, but knowing these details will help you maximize your tax return. Knowing helps planning, and planning helps you have better finances.

{"text": " According to a  report  by the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) in 2019, 5.4% of households in American were unbanked or had no bank accounts. There are several reasons that someone may not have a bank account. Past financial mistakes like too many overdraft fees or bounced checks can make it hard to open a new account. Some people don't trust banks or have the funds to meet the minimum balance requirements to open a new account. Others just want to avoid bank fees. If you don't have a bank account, it can be helpful to know your options for cashing checks, getting paid, and paying bills.    How to Cash a Check Without a Bank Account  If you don't have a bank account, you will probably still need to cash checks. Whether it is your paycheck, your tax refund, or any other source of income, knowing how to cash a check will help you get your money.  The best place to try to cash a check without a bank account is the bank that issued it. If you get your paycheck, for example, cashing it at the same bank where your employer banks is a good option. This is because the bank can verify that the account the check was written from has the funds in it to cover it. This advice goes for personal checks, too. If you can, try to cash them at the same bank they are written from. It is important to note that you will need proof of ID to cash your checks. There may also be a small fee for cashing them since you don't have an account at the bank.  Another option for cashing your paycheck, tax refund, or other income is to cash it at a big box store like Walmart and Kroger. Similar to banks, in order to cash a check at a store, you will need a valid ID. The stores may also charge a small check-cashing fee. Often these stores won't cash personal checks because they cannot verify if the funds to cover the check are in the check writer's account.  Using a Prepaid Debit Card  While cashing your checks and having access to the funds is important, if you want to also be able to pay bills online, using a prepaid debit card may be a better solution. Prepaid debit cards work like debit cards, but you don't need a bank account to get one. Some prepaid debit cards allow you to have money directly deposited into them. This means that you can have your paycheck, tax refund, or other income sources deposited directly to the card. You can also find prepaid debit cards that will let you deposit checks remotely using the camera on your smartphone.  Paying bills may be easier with a prepaid debit card than cash. You can use your prepaid debit card to make purchases online and pay bills. Some even offer bill pay services. It is important to look at the fees associated with the card you choose. Some charge reloading fees to add funds to the card. Others charge you to get cash from an ATM or pay bills through their bill pay service.  Final Thoughts  Not having a bank account can make it more difficult to cash checks and pay bills. If you want to cash a check and have the cash for spending, cashing the check at the bank that issued it or a big box store may be the best route. If you want to pay bills online, a prepaid debit card may be the answer.  No matter what route you choose, be sure that you understand the fees and requirements. You want to find the option that gives you access to the features you need for the lowest fees. This will help you meet your personal finance needs while keeping the money that you are making! '\""}
{"text": " My experience talking about finances with my wife  Back in the early 90s when I was first seriously dating, the only thing I could think to ask my future wife was, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d At no time during the wooing process did we discuss money or finances at all. We had no money, jobs, or children and we both lived at home with our parents.   After we got married and had children and jobs, we started building a life together. But we still didn't really talk about our finances. Even when we purchased our first home together, because I paid the bills and we qualified for the loan on my credit history and income, there were no financial discussions. At the same time, we did not have a lot of debt, we had a good credit rating, and we definitely did not have any student loans. Fast forward 30 years and we still rarely talk about the subject, but our finances are in great shape.  Debt is extremely common  Over the last 10 years, many people have taken on lots of debt, especially student loans. Americans have several different types of debt. Between credit card debt, mortgages, auto loans and student loans,  the average debt per household is about $132,529 . As of 2020, 1 in 4 Americans have student loan debt. An estimated 44.7 million people now owe  more than $1.53 trillion  in student loan debt. The average student loan debt amount is $37,172, with monthly payments of $393.  Money and love  Considering these compelling statistics and other financial factors such as income inequality, I suggest that all people in a relationship discuss finances. This is especially important if your finances are intertwined with your partner in any way. Financial issues, if left unresolved, can ruin even the most successful marriages. When a couple's finances are not in order, it leaves both of them feeling insecure and can eventually lead the relationship into turmoil. This principle applies to unmarried couples and people in serious relationships alike. So when the relationship gets serious, discuss things like debt, credit, credit scores, and mutual financial goals together.  When I first got married, my wife and I did not discuss finances. But today I believe it's important to discuss love and money in your relationship. These conversations, even when they are difficult, can help build trust and healthy communications with your partner. Being transparent about your financial situation will help you find long-term financial stability together.  '\""}
{"text": "A lot of members tell us they're interested in investing. Maybe you're starting to save regularly, and you're wondering how your money can work for you instead of  sitting passively in a bank account .  What Are Your Goals?  Before jumping into investment strategies, start with this basic question: what is the point of investing to you?  If your answer is something like, \u201cI want to make oodles of money,\u201d I suggest getting more specific and more realistic. If you expect to make a lot of money from an investment, this may cause you to take unnecessary (or unwise) risks to chase huge returns.  Instead, use your short, intermediate, and long-term targets and financial goals to inform your investment decisions.  How Much Can You Safely Invest?  Before thinking about your future self, make sure you're taking care of your immediate needs. Your emergency fund and debt management should still be priorities. Make sure you have a sustainable plan for your daily money management. Investing has risk involved, so don't count on that money being available in an emergency.  Beyond making sure you have enough saved for emergencies, think about how much you feel comfortable investing.  Assess your risk tolerance  \u2013 whether you're comfortable with high-risk (potentially high-reward or high-loss) investments.  How Much Effort Do You Want to Put Into Investing?  There are so many options out there. Ask yourself how hard you want to work at maintaining your investment portfolio. Do you want to do lots of research and actively manage all your money, or do you want to let a service or professional manage your investments for you?  If you're interested in a DIY approach,  do your research first . One option is to start small, perhaps with an app that allows you to manage relatively small investments (for example,  Acorns  or  Robinhood ).  If you'd prefer to leave your money to an expert, I caution you to  know your expert .  Start, Monitor, and Adjust  As with all your financial decisions, check in regularly to see if you're happy with the results. If you're not, review what you have done, take a good look at the outcome, and make adjustments if necessary.  One way to know if your investment plan is working for you is to do what we call \u201cthe pillow test.\u201d It's pretty easy. If your investments are causing you to lose sleep, you need a better plan\\\\xa0\u2013 and don't be afraid to get help. Your investment plan should be working  for  you, not causing you stress.

{"text": "There are a lot of financial myths out there that simply aren't true! Making good financial decisions starts with having the correct information you need to make those decisions. I'm going to go through four common myths about personal finance to get to the bottom of those misconceptions.  1. \u201cPaying rent is throwing away money.\u201d  Paying rent is a living expense just like food, clothes, gas, or other transportation costs. This myth is usually coupled with \u201chomeownership is the ONLY surefire investment\u201d (which is also not true). Think about it: the point of paying rent is to have a place to live, right? So, if what you are paying for (a place to live) is getting you what you need, that is by definition NOT throwing away money. Owning a home is a big commitment and it isn't for everyone. There are lots of  pros and cons to this decision , so be realistic about your needs and which approach best meets those needs.  2. \u201cBad credit takes forever to rebuild.\u201d  Good credit is an asset! Having bad credit can feel like a hopeless situation. There are some things that take longer to correct on your credit report, but that is not the same as hopeless. There are  a few things you can do right away  to put yourself on track to a higher credit score.  3. \u201cI'm young \u2013 I have plenty of time to save for retirement!\u201d  Being young is definitely a major advantage for retirement planning and the fact is, you do have plenty of time. The challenge is that you have no idea what that time will bring (both ups and downs), so the earlier you prepare, the less you will need to save as you get older. Check out this  retirement calculator  to see how much of a perk being young is when it comes to retirement planning.  4. \u201cI'm old \u2013 it's too late to save for retirement\u201d  Every day is a new day. Although you can't change the choices you made in the past (if you figure this one out, let me know, okay?), focus on what you can do now to prepare for life in retirement. This may mean making some adjustments to the traditional ideas of retirement \u2013 that can mean anything and you get to decide what it means for you. I changed careers at when I was over 40 because I simply wasn't going to have enough to retire in my 60s. If retirement age is approaching fast and you feel like you're running tight on time, start where you are now.  Get a clear picture of your current situation and then design your \u201cencore\u201d years. Once you know where you are going, you can create a plan to get there. I simply LOVE  this woman's approach  to dealing with the shift in her retirement reality. '\""}
{"text": " Although these types of accounts are similar, they have important differences.   What is a checking account?  A checking account is designed for day-to-day use. There are many options when it comes to checking accounts. The most popular options are free and allow you to make as many withdrawals as you want. Sometimes the bank or credit union will require a monthly automatic deposit into this account, and some checking accounts pay a  very  modest interest rate.  What is a money market account?  A money market account is technically a checking account, but with more restrictions. Money market accounts often have a $1,000 minimum balance requirement. If your balance drops below the minimum requirement, some banks will charge a monthly service charge. You are limited to six withdrawals a month on this account, three of which can be checks. Due to these restrictions, the account pays higher interest than a normal checking account. The interest rate is often tiered, so the more money you have in the account, the higher your interest rate.  What is a savings account?  A savings account also has limited withdrawals, but usually only a $100 minimum in order to avoid a monthly fee. This account generally has a higher interest rate than a checking account, but lower than a money market account.  Other types of bank accounts  Banks and credit unions now offer \u201chybrids\u201d of each of these accounts. Each account type has their own requirements and benefits to entice you to bank with them. The market is quite competitive and new products are always being added. Shop around to find the account that is best for your banking needs! '\""}
{"text": "Credit slips can happen to anyone \u2013 and although you may panic when you see that number go in the wrong direction, sometimes even the best financial decisions may bring about a credit slip.  So dust yourself off and congratulate yourself on being proactive in checking your credit score and taking actions to help it bounce back. In a country where  half of adults haven't checked their credit score in the last six months , you're already ahead of the curve.  Your 90-Day Credit Sprint  The first thing I want you to do is check your budget to prepare for a 90-day credit-building sprint. During this sprint, you'll focus on paying all your bills on time and  reducing your utilization rates , two crucial factors that determine your credit score.   Create a plan with checkpoints at 90 days, 6 months, and one year.  Work the plan by using free services like Credit Karma or Credit Sesame.  Check your progress regularly. If you have a credit card that offers a free credit score, you can use that. Make sure you're not paying for scores.  Celebrate! Don't miss out on an opportunity to recognize your progress when you reach your checkpoints or other big milestones.   Long-Term Credit Building  Create an ongoing plan for yourself to make sure that your credit score reflects your hard work and makes you a good candidate for new credit should you need it.  As part of this plan, it's important that you conduct an  annual review  of your credit report to make sure it is accurate because this information will determine your credit score.

{"text": " Saving money is always a priority, but the amount you save depends on your other goals, such as paying off debt. A rule of thumb is to save at least $1,000 to cover emergency expenses. Consider labeling your emergency account, \u201cDebt-Proof Insurance.\u201d The title is a reminder that the account exists to keep you out of debt. Without cash to pay for emergency expenses, you may find yourself in a never-ending cycle of paying off debt, having an unexpected expense, and having to use credit to pay for the cost. When your account drops below $1,000, stop extra payments towards debt and get your account back up to $1,000. Once it's at $1,000, use the extra money to continue your debt payoff strategy.  In addition to saving for emergency expenses, save for the expenses you know will happen during the year. This includes scheduled car and home maintenance. These expenses should be a category in your budget.  Once you pay off your debt, celebrate and treat yourself (within reason). Then save at least three months of your monthly living expenses. Ideally, you want to save at least 10% of your income monthly. Prioritize savings like it's a bill so you won't have to pay a credit card bill instead. '\""}
{"text": " The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (otherwise known as SNAP) is a state-run program. Each state has its own process for applying. You can go to your local SNAP office, or some states even allow you to apply online. If you aren't sure, you can call the SNAP toll-free information number: 1-800-221-5689.  Each state has its own list of required documentation. In general, you'll need documentation proving your identity, household size, income, citizenship, social security number, and living expenses.  Once you've submitted your application, you can expect to wait about 30 days before you hear if you are eligible. During that time, you will have to complete an eligibility interview. You can usually complete this interview by phone or in person. If you are eligible, you'll receive benefits back-dated to the date you submitted your application.  You may be able to receive benefits as early as seven days from your application date if you meet additional requirements. These requirements are a demonstration of extreme hardship. This may be the case if your household's combined gross income, and liquid resources are less than your monthly rent, mortgage, and utilities. Contact your state agency for additional details to see if you are eligible and how to proceed. '\""}
{"text": "Focus on You. Pay Yourself First.  Have you ever thought, \u201cI'll pay all of my bills and save what's left\u201d? Well, how much was left? When we wait to save until the end of the month, we usually learn that we have more month than money and there is nothing left. We challenge you to commit to paying yourself first.  \u201cPay yourself first.\u201d We hear it all the time, but what does it really mean? Most of us have thought about saving more or saving more regularly, but how many of us really save before paying our bills?  A Habit of Saving  Paying yourself first means that before you pay anyone else, including essential living expenses, put money in your savings account. This really is the \u201cgolden rule\u201d of personal finance.  The amount you save isn't as important as the habit you create.  The Power of Automatic Transfers  Make saving your priority by setting up an automatic transfer each month. An automatic transfer to your savings account is a perfect way to create a habit of saving AND put yourself first in your financial life. For example, you can set up with your bank an automated weekly transfer of $5 every week to your savings account.  To learn more about what it means to pay yourself first,  check out this video .

{"text": "\u201cI enrolled and contributed to myRA (Roth IRA) since August 2016. The myRA.gov program is now being shut down. What should I do with my only Roth IRA/ Retirement investment?\u201d  Submitted by Brian H.  Admittedly, my heart was broken when the announcement about shutting down myRA\u00ae hit the news. It wasn't perfect, but it was a way to help people do the very thing financial professionals want people to do more: save for retirement.  Do you want to continue saving in a Roth account?  You contribute to a Roth with after-tax dollars (money on which you have already paid income taxes). This means that the tax advantage of the Roth account is particularly helpful if you need the tax break more in your senior years than you do now.  So, first you must decide if a Roth is still the best fit for your needs. There are so many opinions online (I have mine as well), but in order to make this decision,  look at the facts  before you choose. There is no universal right choice \u2013 only the best choice for your circumstances.  If you do want to stick with a Roth, you have options!  1. Do nothing  Your account will be moved automatically.  According to the US Treasury website , \u201cAll open myRA\u00ae accounts will be closed and balances moved to new Roth IRAs at Retirement Clearinghouse, LLC (RCH) if no action is taken.\u201d  2. Transfer to another Roth account  If you have investment accounts in another institution, you can do a \u201ctrustee \u2013 to \u2013 trustee\u201d direct transfer and avoid any fees or penalties. Contact the new institution and they will walk you through the process.  The unknown variable here is the fees, so be cautious and ask questions before making any moves. If you move to an new institution, look for providers that have low fees and low minimums to open an account.  3. Withdraw the funds  This may seem like the easy solution, especially if you have looming debt. However, you can lose the benefit of the interest you have gained. While you won't be penalized for taking out what you put in, you may have penalties if you withdraw the interest you have earned.  If you are not yet 59\u00bd and need the funds, you can withdraw your contribution, but there will be fees: a whopping 10% early withdrawal penalty. You may be able to avoid the fees if you use the money for certain financial goals or situations, such as purchasing your first home, paying college costs, medical bills, or purchasing health insurance after losing your job.  Watch the Clock  The myRA deadlines may provide some insight. If you want to transfer to another Roth, do your research and learn a bit about investing before you take action. Check out these deadlines and consider the timing.   Beware of Fees  Whatever you decide, be wary of anyone trying to sell you something. You should not need to incur fees for this transfer. If you aren't sure about what to do, allowing the US Treasury to place your money in a low-risk account with no management fee may be your best option.  To talk with someone (an actual human) before making this decision, find a\\\\xa0 financial coach or counselor  who can help you consider your options with you specific circumstances in mind. '\""}

{"text": " Even under the best circumstances, most of us deal with financial stress in our daily lives. With the additional stress that has been placed on many individuals and families as a result of COVID-19 from job loss or changes in income, and uncertainty about the future, financial worries are even more common. Dealing with your finances at a time like this can be completely overwhelming. Here are a few strategies to help you manage your money worries right now.  Track Your Spending  Often when you're faced with financial stress, the last thing you feel like doing is creating a budget. But this is almost always the first step towards stress management. Take the time to write all of your expenses down. Break them into fixed expenses (those you can't change) and flexible expenses (those you can change or cut). This can help give you a complete picture of your financial health. Use real numbers for your budget as much as possible. You can do this by looking at past spending and your monthly bills. Creating an accurate budget will give you the best gauge of your actual financial situation. It can also help you determine the lowest amount of money you need to get by.  Cut Expenses Where You Can  Once you have created a budget, it's time to get to work on making changes where you can. Are there services you are paying for (such as the gym) but aren't using either because they are closed, or you've currently made other arrangements? Contact these companies and see if you can suspend or cancel your membership for now. If you are having trouble paying bills, contact your service providers to see if there are any suspension options currently in place as a result of the pandemic. Be sure that you understand the terms of these programs and when payments will resume.    Find Resources in Your Area  It can be helpful in times of financial stress to know you aren't alone. If you are having trouble paying your bills, securing food, or need other services, find resources in your area that you can turn to for help. Look for food assistance programs and healthcare resources locally or at your state level. Reach out for community assistance in paying utility bills with your local community or utility company. There are so many resources out there that can provide help and relief. Become familiar with  what is available in your community .  Avoid Retail Therapy  When we're sad or stressed, we often look for quick emotional boosts. For some people, this means spending money. This can be an expensive habit, and when money is already causing stress it can make a budget go off the rails. Now may be a good time to curb this habit to keep more money in your pocket. If you find yourself browsing online out of boredom or spending money you normally wouldn't just to feel better, avoiding the temptation to shop may be helpful. One good step to take is to hide or delete shopping apps from your mobile devices. This can remove the temptation and help you save your money for necessary expenses.  Find Someone to Talk To  Feeling stressed and worried about money can be a very isolating. If you are struggling with your finances during this time, finding someone to talk to might help. You can speak to a trusted friend or family member, a member of your religious community, or find an Accredited Financial Counselor\u00ae that you can speak to about your worries and concerns.  Having someone to share your stresses with can lighten the load. It can also provide outside perspective and help you find solutions to your problems. SaverLife is also partnering with TrustPlus to offer  free financial coaching  to all members during this crisis.  Times like these can really highlight the stresses in life, and the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly put a focus on personal finance. These are just five things you can do to help manage and mitigate the financial stress that you are experiencing. There are many other ways to manage financial stress. The key is to find the right solution for you!   '\""}
{"text": "It's New Year's resolution season! Even though many resolutions don't make it until the end of winter, it can still be a helpful exercise for many people.  Many years ago, I decided to begin each year with a financial  revolution ! Check out how\\\\xa0 Merriam Webster  defines revolution:   the action by a celestial body of going round in an orbit or elliptical course (not this one\u2026 that might leave me back where I started!)  a sudden, radical or complete change (ah\u2026getting closer. I like it but when I try radical change I sometimes can't keep it up, so\u2026)  a fundamental change in the way of thinking about or visualizing something (Bingo! This is it!)   Thinking about what you want to do differently can help you align your values with your actions. So, where do we begin?  How was 2018?  Let's start with what you already know: how was 2018 for you? Reflect on last year and ask yourself:   What worked for you?  What didn't work?   This is a good starting point for figuring out what you want to change in the new year.  Making measurable resolutions for 2019  With your 2018 finances and financial behaviors in mind, what do you want to do differently this year?  Make sure your goals are measurable. For example, instead of resolving to \u201csave more,\u201d define what that means to you  and  what is important about saving. Do you want to save $20 or $100 a month? Or do you want to save up a specific amount by the end of the year?  A financial goal is usually more effective if we make it SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound). So try something like this:  S : I want to complete the 52 week saving challenge this year  M : I will do this by following the saving plan each week by putting the money in a savings account  A : I can achieve this goal by paying myself first each time I received regular or unexpected income  R : This is important to me because I worry when I don't have emergency savings.  T : My milestones will be a weekly deposit (on Saturday) and the end goal is $1,378 by December 15th.  Decide how you'll check your progress. Is there an app you use to measure your savings, or will you check the balance in your savings account regularly?  How will you make it happen?  Now that you know what, when, and how you want this change to happen, it's time to make a plan and execute! Include check-in points to evaluate your progress and adjust your goals. If there are any resources you need, like an accountability partner or a separate savings account, get that in place as well.  Be realistic with yourself to make sure you're setting yourself up for success. Doing something differently with money can be challenging, so think about how you're going to maintain momentum. I'm confident that creating a solid plan to achieve your revolution will improve your chances of following through!  Bonus: Your financial book club!  I certainly know what one of my resolutions is this year: to read and educate myself even more about finances and different perspectives. If you want to join me in this resolution, there are two books that I think everyone should read:   The Richest Man in Babylon  by George Clausen  Mind Over Money  by Brad Klontz   In the spirit of saving, check these out from your local library!  \\\\xa0  Photo by\\\\xa0 Martin Hauenstein \\\\xa0from\\\\xa0 Pexels '\""}
{"text": " Submitted by anonymous.  That's a great question, as many Americans' only source of income is Social Security. Social Security income is taxed for federal and state income tax purposes. If your earned income exceeds IRS 2019 filing guidelines, you are required to file a tax return with the IRS and in most states.  Do I need to file a state tax return?  State income tax is limited to earned income in some states, like North Dakota, where state income tax rate is 1.1%. Some states exempt earned income altogether. These include Alaska, Wyoming, Washington, South Dakota, Florida, Nevada, and Texas (as well as Tennessee, which only taxes interest).  Do I need to file a federal tax return?  Under 2019 IRS filing guidelines, the minimum income amount at which you need to file depends on two main factors. The two factors are status and age. Status means whether you are filing as single, married, head of household, or married filing separate. If you are under age 65, are single, and have Social Security income below $12,200, you generally don't have to file a federal tax return. If you are older than 65, the amount goes up to $13,850 before you must file a federal tax return.  Hopefully, this answer is what you need to know about filing taxes with just Social Security income.  '\""}
{"text": " There are a couple of ways to get out of debt and back on track with your finances. Let's walk through some straightforward steps together!  Start with Budgeting Basics  To start with, make a budget. Total up all your monthly take home pay. Next, start to subtract all of your expenses. You will want to subtract your housing, car, gas, food, entertainment, clothing, insurance just to name a few. Be thorough and honest about your spending. Once you've subtracted everything, hopefully you have a positive number. If not, you need to go through all your expenses and decide where you can cut back until you do have a positive number.  Doing this will allow you to free up extra money to put toward your debt, and will also keep you from going further into debt.  Non-Profit Credit Counseling  One option is to work with a non-profit credit counseling agency. They will negotiate lower payments, a lower interest rate, or both with each of your creditors. From there, you pay them a small monthly fee along with the total new monthly payments and they make your payments for you.  This can be extremely helpful if you are feeling overwhelmed, are receiving phone calls, or can't get out from under the debt due to huge interest rates.  To learn more, find a legitimate  credit counseling agency .   Debt Reduction Plan  Another option is to set up your own debt reduction plan. You can do this easily using a tool I like called  PowerPay . It's a free website. You will put in all your debts, including the dollar amounts, interest rates, and minimum payments.  You will have also put in how much extra you can pay each month. This is where your budget comes in handy! Even if it's a small amount, it will make difference. The website will then calculate how long it will take you to get out of debt, and even print you a calendar showing how much to pay on each debt, each month.  (The directions for this site are on the homepage, on the right-hand side.)  Finding the Right Plan for You  The difference between the two programs is that with PowerPay, you still make the monthly payments, the interest rate stays the same, and the cards remain open. When using a Debt Management Program through a credit counseling agency, you make a payment to the agency and they pay your creditors each month. The interest rates are lowered but the cards will close.  You can also use a combination of both of these plans if there are cards you want to remain open, but others you want to close.    ***  The burden of debt can be overwhelming. Making a plan to tackle this debt can help lower your stress and allow you to see a way out. With a little hard work, you can be debt free. '\""}

{"text": " Do you ever wonder what is the right age to talk to your kids about money?  Or what should you be talking to your kids about to help them understand and manage money well?   Talking About Money Is Probably Easier Than You Expect  Most kids are naturally interested in money, or the things that money can buy, at an early age. This may come in the form of the tempting candy in the grocery check-out line or a desire for french fries from the drive-thru. You can use this natural interest to help your children build foundational financial thinking skills that will help them throughout life.   Use Daily Life Events to Teach Your Children Key Financial Principles  Where Does Money Come From?  It's understandable that children don't always know where money comes from. To them, our cash or credit card just appears from our purse or wallet. Make the connection for them that the money you spend is earned through work. Maybe you leave the home to go to work, or work from home, or maybe your work is taking care of these precious children. Whatever the case, help them understand the connection.  Another way we receive money is from gifts. If they receive a birthday gift, they learn that money sometimes comes as a gift.    Explain Wise Purchase Decisions  When you are out shopping, explain the choices that you are making when you choose one product over another. You are looking at the price, how much you need, the quality of the item, and how suitable the item is for how you'll use it. If they're trying to choose between two items, talk with them about the benefits of each item, and the downsides of the item. Ask them what is most important to them. This helps them flex their decision-making muscles.  Working Toward a Long-Term Goal  Another lesson to share with your children is that it can take time to meet a financial goal. Perhaps you're building an emergency fund. You can involve your children by telling them about your goal and sharing specific examples of the trade-offs you make to put money aside for those goals. When you reach a milestone toward your goal, celebrate with them. Make some noise and do a happy dance together!  Understanding that many of our goals take time and perseverance, and even that there are setbacks along the way, will help them in many areas of life.  Teach Them about  Needs Versus Wants  This can be tough for children. In the moment, a drive-thru french fry may seem like a need. Here you have the opportunity to teach them that food is a need, but the particular type or method of getting food is a want. For example, you could help them see that for the same amount of money you can make many more french fries at home using the bag of frozen fries and even more using a bag of potatoes bought at the grocery store. This small teaching moment will help them see the difference between a need (the priority for your family's money) versus a want (a treat and nice-to-have after our needs are met).  Here's the example I might use to talk through with your kids:  French Fry Options Medium Size (Drive-Thru): \u00bc of a pound for $2.99 Frozen Fries (Grocery Store): 2 pounds for $2.96 Bag of Potatoes (Grocery Store): 5 pounds for $2.67  Ask your kids which they would choose and why, and talk to them about the trade-offs of time, convenience, quality, quantity, and money.  Get Some Fun Help from Kid Experts  Sesame Street has a fun website called  Finances for Kids . On the site, there are videos of Elmo learning about these financial fundamentals. What will Elmo decide to buy with his dollar? What will Elmo learn about where money comes from? Cookie Monster and kids relate to how it can be tough to wait for things they want. There are also printables for parents and caregivers and other resources to help your little one.  Lifelong Financial Learning  Your money discussions with your children will change and evolve as they grow older. The conversation may change from the candy at the grocery check-out, to the latest fashionable clothing, shoes, or technology, to money decisions related to work, college, or a trade school. However, the key principles are understanding where money comes from, how to make wise purchase decisions, and needs versus wants. These will be constant themes that will serve them well at any age.

{"text": "\u201cHow do you know which life insurance is good for you?\u201d  Submitted by Migdalia C.  Life (and other) insurance policies are a way to protect your assets. If you think about your decision this way, you'll have the information you need to make the best decision for you.  What are your needs?  Consider these questions:   Who is depending on you for income?  What resources do you want to leave for those you care about?  Are there any other needs for life insurance? For example: charitable donations and education for children.  How will the premiums fit into your budget now and over the term of the policy?   Evaluate your options  Once you understand your needs, you can  begin to investigate your options . By considering your needs before shopping, you'll be better able to assess how much insurance you need and the cost you're willing to spend.  This is a financial product, so work with facts rather than emotions. This will help you figure out if the person or company you are considering is offering the right product for your needs and budget.  Insurance policies charge fees and often pay commissions to the person selling them to you. Find a trusted resource and be prepared to ask questions to ensure the recommendation is best for you (not based on the highest commission).  Many fee-only financial planners (fiduciary standard means they don't sell products) suggest buying term life insurance that suits your time horizon (often based on your expected employment term and/or the period of time that your dependents will rely on you for income). Term policies often last 20 or 30 years. Some believe this is \u201cgambling\u201d or throwing away money because a term policy has no cash value at the end of the term. The point of this type of policy is to insure against losses during the term. This means the costs will be lower than a \u201cwhole life\u201d policy, which has an investment feature and often comes with a hefty premium.  Alternative life insurance options  If you need and can't afford life insurance, check out  LifeBridge  by Mass Mutual. This program offers free policies for parents and guardians.

{"text": " It's that time of year when you hear tax terms being tossed around, whether on the news, at work by the HR Department, or over coffee with friends. But what exactly do all these terms mean? A commonly used term is Adjusted Gross Income or AGI. What is AGI, and how do you calculate it?  Your adjusted gross income is the amount of money you earned minus all allowable adjustments. You want this number to be as low as possible. Once you know your AGI, you'll subtract either the itemized deduction amount or the standard deduction amount. The resulting number will be used to calculate the amount of tax you owe. The lower your AGI, the lower the amount of taxes you need to pay.  How to Calculate Your Adjusted Gross Income  Step 1: Calculate Your Income for the Year  This includes your salary, of course.  It could be from Social Security, IRAs, or pensions.  Don't forget any business income you've earned or money from a side hustle. Include alimony and unemployment in this calculation.  Step 2: Add Up All Allowable Adjustments  Here is where you want to find as many as possible. Remember, the lower you get your income, the less tax you have to pay.  Schedule 1 of Form 1040  has a comprehensive list of all the adjustments available. The adjustments are:  Educator expenses Certain business expenses Health Savings Account deduction Moving expenses for members of the Armed Forces Deductible part of self-employment tax Self-employment SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans Self-employment health insurance deduction Penalty on early withdrawal of savings Alimony paid IRA deduction Student loan interest Tuition and fees deduction  Some of these deductions require additional documentation or forms.  They will also be available on the IRS website.   Step 3: Subtract Total Adjustments From Total Income  Congratulations! You have just calculated your Adjusted Gross Income.    There is a lot of software available to you to complete your taxes. The IRS offers free tax software called  Free File  to anyone who has an AGI less than $72,000. The program will guide you through the forms by asking you a series of questions. Read more about  options for filing your taxes for free .  Preparing your taxes or even talking about taxes can be intimidating. But knowing a couple of terms can lessen that fear. At SaverLife, we're here to answer your questions and help you through the process.  '\""}
{"text": " Hi, I'm Saundra Davis, financial coach here at SaverLife. Today we're going to talk\\\\xa0about how you make your money work for you.  What is a budget?  If you ask, \u201cDo you have a budget?\u201d\\\\xa0many folks will say no, they don't have a budget. The fact is we all have a\\\\xa0budget, whether we know it or not. Money comes in and money goes out and how our\\\\xa0cash flows by default becomes our budget.  Is your budget working for you?  The question is: Are you happy with the\\\\xa0choices that you make and are your choices getting you what you want? If the\\\\xa0way you're spending your money is not getting you what you want, you might be\\\\xa0happier if you make some choices about where you want your money to go before\\\\xa0you actually spend it. There are some easy rules of thumb that you can try to\\\\xa0see if one of them work for you.  The 80/20 rule  Let's start with the  80/20 rule . Many people\\\\xa0try to live within 80% of your income, making sure that 80% of\\\\xa0all your income goes to your living and your lifestyle expenses. So we're talking\\\\xa0about your rent or your mortgage, your food, your transportation, leaving 20% to\\\\xa0put in to savings. If you live in an area where it's just not reasonable to live within 80% of your income, you might have to\\\\xa0do a 90/10 percent split: 90% for your living expenses, 10% for\\\\xa0savings.  The key is make sure savings factors in to all of your decisions, even\\\\xa0if it's only a little bit and that you put your savings aside first before you\\\\xa0pay all of your bills.  Re-evaluate your new strategy  Now the question is: How will you know if this is working?\\\\xa0Try on a new approach for a short period of time \u2013 one, two, or three months \u2013 to\\\\xa0determine if you're happier with the choices that you're making. Remember\\\\xa0you're the boss. Your money, your decisions. You can decide how you save\\\\xa0and how you spend.  What are you saving for? '\""}
{"text": " Many small businesses are experiencing economic hardship because of COVID-19. In light of social distancing recommendations and other stay-at-home rules, there has been a dramatic decrease in economic activity.   There are two main programs in the CARES Act that support small businesses. These programs are the Paycheck Protection Program or PPP 7(a) Loan Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) loan program. They provide economic relief to small businesses adversely impacted by the COVID-19.   Under the CARES Act, your PPP loan can be forgiven up to the full principal amount if you use the loan on approved expenses. SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) are available to small businesses that suffer economic injury in a declared disaster area. These loans have a low-interest rate up to $200,000 for 30 years. Under the EIDL program, small business owners can apply for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan advance of up to $10,000. This advance provides economic relief to businesses experiencing a temporary loss of revenue and will not have to be repaid.  Eligible business can apply for both programs. Refer to the  Small Business Administration website  for information on SBA loan programs. '\""}
{"text": "Ah, opening a joint bank account or credit card \u2013 so easy to do, yet so hard to untangle if things don't go as planned.  Once you open a joint account, the money that was \u201cyours\u201d is now \u201cours.\u201d That's a big step for any relationship. Make sure you're on the same page about how you will manage money as a couple.  Pitfalls of Joint Accounts  Like any financial decision, opening a joint account has risks and rewards. Co-owners of an account can legally spend, give away, or transfer funds to other accounts. They don't need consent or knowledge of other account holders. This leaves you with relatively little protection.  Before you take this step, make sure you're confident with your reasons for opening a joint account. What are your goals? Are there other ways to achieve those goals?  Financial Infidelity  As you think about opening a joint account, consider your views on financial privacy and \u201cfinancial infidelity.\u201d Do you think you or your partner should be allowed to keep some aspects of your financial lives separate and private? The National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE) reports that  over 40% of American adults who combine finances with a partner commit financial deceptions  against their significant other. Plus, 75% of adults say financial deceit has affected their relationship.  Watch Your Credit Score  Joint credit cards can impact your credit score negatively, but they can also improve your credit score! If one partner uses credit beyond their means to pay, this can create financial hardship and conflict.  Check Your Money Values  Understanding how your financial values differ from those of your partner is key to managing money together.  NEFE's LifeValues quiz  can help you identify the values that drive your financial decisions. I encourage you to take the quiz and compare results with your partner.  If you come out with different results, that's okay! Use that as a starting point to talk about how you'll manage different perspectives, behaviors, and values.  Benefits of Joint Accounts  Managing money together can be beneficial for both parties. It's an opportunity to learn about each other's money personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. It can also allow someone with lower credit to get more favorable credit terms (lower interest rates, higher credit limits) and improve their credit.  The key is communication. If you can't talk openly about the pros and cons of opening a joint account, it might be better to manage your money separately until you're on the same page. '\""}
{"text": "Holidays can be filled with  both joy and stress .  As a starting point, think about the end of the holiday season. How do you want to feel? What experiences are important to you? And of course, what do you want your credit card balance to look like?  What are the holidays about?  As you go into the holiday season, think about what lessons you want your children to take from your celebrations. This is a good opportunity to teach the value of time. Your presence is just as important as the presents. Here's a list I like of  ways to be present  during the holidays.  You're setting the foundation for how your children will experience family traditions when they are adults. You're also modeling financial behavior to your kids, and  teaching them about advertising . What legacies do you want to establish?  Commit to a holiday budget  Our families, and especially our children, may have expectations or wish lists for the holidays. But what do you want to drive your purchasing choices?  If you decide in advance how much you want to spend and how you'll allocate that money, you may end up in a much better place in January. Once you have a plan, talk to your children about what is important during this season (ideally, before they make that huge list for Santa).  Alternative gift ideas  If you decide to cut back on toys and games, you can still mark the occasion with a different kind of gift. Coupon books for fun holiday activities with your kids are a great way to build memories together.  Plus, with the money you would have spent on toys, you can give investments, 529 contributions, or savings accounts. I think of this as saving money for your kids instead of spending money for them. In the long term, they'll appreciate the investment in their futures.  ***  The holidays can be a time of community and connection that focuses on our presence with our children. What is one thing you can do to have a holiday season that is restorative and rejuvenating? For more ideas about how to plan for a happy holiday season,  check out this resource . '\""}
{"text": " Have you noticed that even when your income increases, it can feel like you still don't have more money leftover at the end of the month? That's because often, when our income increases, our expenses do too. This is a very real phenomenon called  lifestyle inflation . It can sneak up on us despite our best intentions to save.  Pent-Up Demand  Lifestyle inflation is often caused by something called pent-up demand. In other words, with your lower income, you were sacrificing something you wanted or needed in order to save for a specific goal (read more about  opportunity costs ) or because money is tight.  Now that you have a higher income, you start spending more money on that pent-up need. Consider these examples:  You get a raise and buy a new car that you've been needing for a while. You get a better-paying job and start eating out more because the job is more demanding and you have less time for shopping and cooking. After graduating from college, you get your first job. But you also start sending more money to support your family members who've helped you along the way.  Money Mindset  You want your higher income to get you closer to your overall financial goals, but your money mindset can get in the way. Sometimes when people are accustomed to struggling financially, they spend their way back to what feels comfortable.  Learn more about your money mindset with this video I made about  finding your money style .  How to Avoid Lifestyle Inflation  There are a lot of reasons that our expenses often increase as our income increases. So how do we avoid that?  The trick is to set short, intermediate, and long-term financial goals and hold yourself to them. Create a policy for yourself about what you will do with increased income. Make sure your goals are specific and measurable. For example, you may decide to automatically save 10% of any windfall or increase in salary.  As always, it'll be easier to follow through on your goals if you know your \u201cwhy.\u201d Remembering your goal will help you stay on track when you have multiple financial priorities.  '\""}

{"text": " There has been a ton of news coverage about the second round of stimulus payments. Whether or not you've received a stimulus check, there's more to the bill that could potentially benefit you.  You probably don't have time to read the 500+ pages of legislation, so we've done that for you. This post is a good overview of the elements of the law that might apply to you. And stay tuned, because in the coming weeks, we'll be providing more information and resources as they come out.  For now, we've separated everything about the stimulus bill into:  Actions you should take  immediately Things you should do  soon Policies and programs that may benefit you  in the future  Actions to take right now  The last stimulus payments were made on January 15th. If yours was direct deposited or added to your Economic Impact Payment Card, you've already received it. If it's coming in the mail as a check, you may not have gotten it yet. Check your mail or your EIP card to see if you have received it.   Tip : You can check the status of your payment using the  IRS Get My Payment tool .  If you already have food stamp (SNAP) benefits, you're eligible for a 15% higher benefit limit, which you'll receive automatically. Note that there may be a delay of up to a month. This increase is good through June 30, 2021, so if you've been considering applying for SNAP benefits, now's the time.  SNAP eligibility has also been extended to cover college students who are eligible for a federal or state work study program or with an expected family contribution of zero. Learn more about getting immediate food assistance at  usa.gov/food-help , or call 1-844-USA-GOV1 (1-844-872-4681) to ask any question about the U.S. government for free. This line is available 8:00am \u2013 8:00pm Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.  If you're a small business owner or sole proprietor needing extra economic support, you may be eligible to apply for a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan and an Economic Injury Disaster Loan ( EIDL ) through the Small Business Administration (SBA). However, you can't use the PPP loan for the same purpose as the EIDL. Find out more about all of your options  here . Note that the rules around loan forgiveness have changed, so  familiarize yourself with those .   Tip : The SBA has a hotline to answer questions: 1-800-659-2955, 7 days a week from 7:00am to 9:00pm. The SBA also offers free local advice, including info on the EIDL advance. Find a local partner  here .  Actions to take soon  In the coming weeks, there are a few more actions you can proactively take to make the most of the new stimulus law.   The most important action is to file your taxes. If you qualify for a stimulus payment, but it has not been issued by January 15th, you'll need to file your 2020 taxes in order to receive it. Our last article, \u201c Have You Received Your Second Stimulus Payment Yet? \u201d will give you more information about your eligibility.   Filing your taxes may also enable you to receive a tax refund and/or Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which can be helpful. For 2020, the government is allowing you to claim the EITC based on your 2019 income. If you've lost income this year, you may be able to use this to get a larger tax refund. SaverLife estimates that 49% of our members should use the EITC lookback to get a larger tax refund, so there's a high likelihood this applies to you!  Note : Mixed-immigration status families are eligible for the second stimulus payment and retroactively eligible for the first one! If you're eligible but haven't received it, you'll need to file your taxes to receive it.  Tip : If the idea of filing your taxes is intimidating, consider that many people qualify for free brand-name tax prep software.  Check out this article  on how to file your taxes for free.  A word of warning: Many services offer your tax refund earlier in exchange for a fee or a percent of your refund. These products can cause problems, particularly if you miscalculate your anticipated refund and get a loan for more than you're due \u2014 in which case, you will owe the service money! You also get less money at the end of the day, of course, because these services often have predatory terms of service with high fees. SaverLife wants to make sure you maximize your tax refund instead of paying some of it to a rapid refund or refund anticipation loan company.  Actions to take later  There are also a few things from the stimulus bill you can keep in mind as the year goes along. You don't necessarily need to take immediate action, but these may be items for your to-do list at some point.  Student loan debt  The federal student loan moratorium has now been extended to September 30, 2021. You may have already received or will soon receive notice from your student loan servicer that it's time to pay. And there may be  more  you can do to lower your monthly payments, including switching to income-driven repayment plans.  Rental and mortgage assistance  As housing assistance programs roll out, review your housing and rent status. An eviction moratorium has now been extended through March 31, 2021. We're waiting to hear more about how to apply for these programs, but you may be eligible for the new rental assistance program if:  you're behind on rent you make 50% or less of your area median income and you have been unemployed for 90 or more days  It's a good idea to communicate with your landlord or bank to make payment arrangements if you may need extra time or help.  Internet access  Keep an eye out for broadband access opportunities. You may be able to receive better or cheaper internet access soon. We'll update you as more details become available.  Pell grants  The Federal Pell Grant is typically awarded to undergraduates who have a high degree of unmet financial need. Within this stimulus bill, eligibility for Pell grants has been extended, with wider income eligibility. Additionally, if you previously couldn't qualify because you were incarcerated, had a drug conviction, or had used up your Pell grant for a for-profit college that has closed, you may now be eligible.  ***  We'll post again next week with California-specific policies for residents of that state. And if you're not a Californian, stay tuned for more updates on the latest stimulus bill soon. '\""}
{"text": "\u201cWhere are the best places for people on state assistance to start saving for retirement? I'm looking for something with low starting balances and low monthly transfers to the account. Do you recommend any financial companies, savings accounts, government-issue bonds, stock market?? I am so confused!\u201d  Submitted by Jessica L.  I want to acknowledge your foresight in thinking about retirement savings. One of the challenges you are facing is the \u201casset means test,\u201d which can be a barrier to receiving public benefits if you have savings that exceed the eligibility threshold.  Start with Small Savings  Your first instinct is right on. Begin saving small amounts in an account that is liquid in case you have a financial emergency. I call this a \u201csave/don't spend\u201d account. If you are on state assistance, investing in the stock market may be more of a risk than is appropriate. I suggest first making sure that your daily living expenses and emergency savings are fully covered.  Some states are building \u201cSecure Choice\u201d retirement accounts specifically for low- and moderate-income residents. The  Pew Charitable Trusts  offers a deeper dive into this topic.  Steps For Building Savings  So what now? Here are a few things to keep in mind:   Focus on your current financial situation. Make sure you have a budget that is working for you and you are able to stick to it consistently. Identify any money available for savings.  Save small amounts every month in an account that is accessible. You can use this money as your emergency fund and it can become the \u201cbase\u201d of your retirement fund. Make sure you stay under the eligibility threshold as long as the state assistance is necessary for your financial stability.  Remember that any assets that are held in your name are subject to review by the state. Some assets are excluded and will not impact your benefits. Cash savings and investments are often subject to the asset limits.  Stay on top of local efforts to remove asset limits or state retirement programs.  Contact a  financial coach or counselor  if you need additional help.   Learn Your Local Eligibility Rules  The savings limits vary from state to state. Check your local community to make sure you're following the eligibility guidelines. There are efforts around the country to remove this savings barrier for people who are attempting to build financial security. However, the reality is that you should be thoughtful about saving if you need the benefits for your current living expenses. '\""}
{"text": " The COVID 19 pandemic has impacted our lives quite a bit. It has even changed our tax forms by adding a tax credit. The Recovery Rebate Credit was authorized by the CARES Act. Many of us received all or part of it in advance in the form of an  Economic Impact Payment . And the Consolidated Appropriations Act passed in December of 2020 provided  another Economic Impact Payment  for many of us.  As of this writing, the 2020 1040 Form and Instructions are in draft form. A version that provides reconciliation for the second round of economic impact payments has not been provided yet. However, the IRS stated that 2020 tax returns will include a Recovery Rebate Credit that covers both economic impact payments. But what does this mean?  File Your Taxes if You Didn't Receive Your Full Stimulus Payments  If you didn't receive any of the economic impact payments you were entitled to, you will be able to reconcile that on your 2020 tax return. For example, if you should have received $1200 the first time and $600 the second time \u2013 but you didn't \u2013 indicate that on your tax return. You should receive the payments as the recovery rebate credit in your tax refund. Or, if you would otherwise owe taxes, the IRS will apply the credit to your tax liability. If you added a child under 17 to your family in 2020 and didn't previously get a payment credited for the child, you can capture that when you file your taxes.   The recovery rebate credit makes sure if you missed any portion of the economic impact payments, you can claim that by filing your taxes. If you are having a tax professional prepare your tax return, I encourage you to bring proof that you received any economic impact payments and the amounts. They will likely ask for it. For those of you who prepare your own tax returns on software the process should be seamless. The software will ask you if you received any economic payments and how much. The software will calculate if you should receive a recovery rebate credit based on what you entered about the payments and based on the individuals listed on your tax return.  Will I Have to Pay Back My Stimulus Check If I'm No Longer Eligible?  The IRS states there will be no \u201cclawback\u201d for the stimulus. If you received an economic impact payment based on a valid 2018 or 2019 tax return, but your 2020 tax return indicates you would have gotten less, you can keep the money. This has an interesting impact on parents who switch which parent claims a child each year. Consider this scenario: One parent received an economic impact payment for a child based on a 2019 tax return. The other parent claims the child for the 2020 tax return. In this case, the other parent will receive the recovery rebate credit on their 2020 tax return. Each parent can keep the payment or credit.   The economic impact payments and the recovery rebate credits are tax free. The economic impact payments will not reduce your tax refund. If you received these funds, I hope you have used or will use them to improve your financial position.  '\""}
{"text": " [Updated as of October 2020]  If you typically don't file taxes, you have until  November 21st, 2020  to fill out the  IRS Non-Filer form  in order to be sent your stimulus check. About 12 million Americans are still eligible to receive this  $1,200 economic impact payment .  For the past month, we've been asking SaverLife members on a weekly basis if they've received their stimulus payment. We've seen the number of people receiving direct deposits and physical checks has significantly increased. At the same time, the number of people who say they don't expect a stimulus payment has gone down.  What many people have discovered recently is that they're most likely eligible to receive a stimulus payment one way or another.  Want to know if you're eligible?  When we ask people why they don't think they're eligible, we see a few common myths about the stimulus payment:  21% of people we surveyed said they didn't think they would receive an economic impact payment because they don't typically file taxes. But chances are they're probably eligible! Simply fill out the  Non-Filer form  from the IRS to check your eligibility. If you receive SSI or SNAP benefits, you should still be able to receive a stimulus payment.  This is a great resource to confirm your eligibility. If you haven't filed your 2019 taxes yet but you did file your 2018 taxes, you will receive a stimulus payment. '\""}
{"text": " For those of us who have children, just thinking about  putting them through four years of college  can feel overwhelming. In the United States, the cost of college tuition is higher than almost anywhere else in the world. And it keeps rising every year!  According to a survey from the College Board (the company that administers the SAT), the 2020 estimated annual cost was $10,560 for in-state tuition for a four-year public university and $37,650 for tuition at a private university. It costs approximately $284,570 (factoring in inflation) for two married parents with middle-class incomes to raise one child (born in 2015) to age 17, not including college costs. It's understandable that you may find paying for college to be a challenge without assistance.  What Is a Pre-Paid College Tuition 529 Plan?  If you're thinking about saving for college, you may have heard of a traditional 529 plan. A traditional  529 plan  is an investment savings plan in which you can save money to pay for your child's college tuition. All 50 states and some private institutions offer 529 plans. The money that you save is invested so that you can grow your account balance faster than you would in a traditional savings account.  As an alternative, you can also save for college tuition in the Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan. The Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan is an option that public universities in nine participating states and some private universities offer. It allows you to \u201clock in\u201d the cost of college tuition at today's prices. Basically, you save in the same way that you would with a traditional 529 plan or a savings account. However, your total college tuition costs are frozen in advance. That means you don't have to worry about whether your savings will be enough when it's time to pay.  Benefits of a Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan  No Price Surprises . The price of tuition is written into the contract when you sign up for the plan. The price does not increase. Tax-Free Contributions . For 2021, you can contribute up to $15,000 annually per individual without triggering the gift tax. Tax-Free Withdrawals . Similar to the traditional 529 plan, the money you save will grow tax-free. You can withdraw it tax-free to pay for college tuition. Favorable Treatment for Federal Financial Aid . A 529 Pre-Paid Tuition Plan account owned by a parent is considered a parent asset. Only 5.64% of total parent financial assets are counted toward federal aid versus 20% of student-owned assets. No Restrictions for Other Colleges . If you decide not to apply to the college that is sponsoring the Pre-Paid Tuition, you can move the money in your account to any other school you choose.  Just be aware that what you have saved in your account is not guaranteed to cover the full cost of any other college.  Disadvantages of a Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan  Account Withdrawal Restrictions . Unlike the traditional 529 plan, you can only use tax-free withdrawals to pay for tuition costs. Withdrawals made to pay for other college expenses, like room and board or books, may be taxed. Residency Requirement . You must be a resident of the specific state where the public university that offers the Pre-Paid Tuition Plan is located. Pre-Paid Tuition Plans offered by private universities, on the other hand, are open to all US residents. Investment Earnings Restrictions . If you choose to attend a school other than the school that the Pre-Paid Tuition Plan is attached to, you may not be able to transfer all of the investment earnings you have in your account. Plan Open Enrollment . not all plans have open enrollment year-round. Some plans allow enrollment of new accounts only at specified times.  Before you sign up for a Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan, do your homework. Read the plan details carefully to be sure that you understand what it offers and what you're committing to.  If you and your student know in advance that you will be applying to a specific school and want to avoid some of the sticker shock of the rising costs of college tuition, then a Pre-Paid Tuition 529 Plan may be the right tool for you.

Feeling like everyone around you is getting in on an awesome investment opportunity can make it feel like you're missing out, but this is actually a common sales pitch for scams.  Affinity fraud is when a scam targets members of a particular social circle, religious group, or ethnic background \u2013 so even if it seems like everyone around you is buying in to something,  do your research  and start with skepticism.  Ponzi Alert  A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment fraud where they money you're investing does not actually go toward a real company or investment. Instead, the money you \u201cinvest\u201d is used to pay returns to earlier investors. Ponzi schemes at some point fail to attract a steady stream of new investors, and at this point, everyone except the earliest investors will lose their money.  Did you know that Ponzi schemes are named for a real person?  Charles Ponzi  scammed investors in the 1920s with what he claimed was postage stamp speculation. Again, the SEC is a great resource to learn about  Ponzi scheme \u201cred flags\u201d  \u2013 these include being offered unusually high returns with very low risk.  Get an Account Statement  Your investment account statements are easy to skim and throw away, but it's worth taking a closer look to make sure you're clear about the details of your investments. Sometimes you  can  judge a book by its cover: if your account statement looks unprofessional or altered, this is a good tip that it may be fraudulent.  Make sure your account statement has all these  key pieces of information  and don't be afraid to ask questions if you feel like something might be off.  Check the Source  If you're ever suspicious or uncertain, trust your gut and do some research. Here are a few good places to start:   BrokerCheck from FINRA : Use this free online tool to research the background of financial brokers, advisers, and firms.  Certified Financial Planner : CFPs are professionals trained in financial planning who can serve as trustworthy resources in your financial life.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) : The CFPB is a U.S. government agency that works to make sure that banks, lenders, and other financial companies treat consumers fairly.   ***  All investments have some inherent risk (that's the downside of putting money into the market). But if you stick to an investment strategy, create a diversified portfolio, and keep a keen eye out for scams, you can minimize your risk and maximize your reward. '\""}
{"text": "First, let's start with the facts.  There's a widespread fallacy that a score determines whether or not you get credit. The truth is that lenders use a  variety  of factors to make credit decisions. These factors include your FICO scores, but also take into account your income, your employment history, and your credit history.  This means that someone could theoretically extend you credit even though your score is low or decline your credit request even though you have a high score! The decision will depend on the specific creditor's underwriting policies.  So if your credit application has been denied (or if you didn't get the rate or terms you want), here are some steps you should take:  1. Ask Questions  Ask the creditor or insurance company how they evaluated your application and whether they used a credit scoring system. If they use a scoring system, ask them what factors are used in their system, and how you can improve your application. By law, the creditor  must provide specific reasons that your application was rejected .  2. Check Your Credit Report  When your credit is denied, do you know that you can get a free credit report? You usually have 60 days to get this free report from the credit bureau that was used for the decision. Before you reapply or apply to other credits, check this credit report for accuracy.  3. Dispute any Inaccuracies  If you find inaccuracies in your credit report, it's important to contest them so that they don't affect your future credit applications. Check out this  sample letter  that you can use to dispute information on your credit report.  4. Write an Explanatory Letter  In addition to inaccurate or incomplete information on your credit report, you may also feel that there are extenuating circumstances that a creditor should know. In some cases, it may even be helpful to  add a short explanatory statement to your credit report .  5. Think about Why You're Applying for this Credit  This is a great time to revisit your financial goals and plan. How does this credit fit into your short, intermediate, or long-term goals?  6. Take Measures to Improve Your Credit  Consider using a credit-building product, like secured cards or second chance accounts. And focus on the areas that have the greatest impact on your credit, such as a history of on-time payments.  I also want to caution you to avoid predatory lenders if you are denied credit. Be your own advocate and don't accept credit that has unreasonable terms and conditions. '\""}
{"text": " It's never too early to teach your kids about money.  I wish I had learned about the ins and out of money at a much younger age. Growing up, my parents never talked about money in front of me. It was one of those subjects you didn't talk about with anyone. I had to learn most of my money lessons the hard way.  There are two major schools of thought on paying your children an allowance; there is paying for chores and not paying for basic chores. Let's do a deeper dive into those options.  Option 1: Pay Allowance for Chores  Paying an allowance when children complete chores teaches that we all work for money. If you don't do the work, then you don't get paid. This does teach a real-world lesson. However, the flip side is that many believe you are paying kids to do chores that they should be doing anyway. What happens if your child decides they don't need the money this week and won't do chores? I don't want this to add stress to your life.  Option 2: Pay a Flat Allowance Each Week  The second school of thought is to pay a flat allowance each week. This requires that basic chores be done as a part of the family. This gives children the security of real money each week. However, many believe it teaches children to be entitled because they have money handed to them without work.  Option 3: A Middle Ground  There is a third option that is a combination of the two approaches. You pick and choose the best parts of both options for your family. You can build a plan like basic chores are required with a set allowance, but children have the option to earn extra money by doing extra chores.  Sit down as a family and create a list of extra chores. Here are some ideas: washing the dog, raking leaves, washing windows. Then, when your kids want to earn a little extra money, they can choose an extra chore from the list. Make sure you let your kids know what chores you expect them to do and make sure you keep having the conversation as they get older. This also gives you a reason to continue the money conversation. Make sure you don't use allowance as a punishment. This is their first experience with money, and we want it to be a positive one.  How Much Money Should I Give for Allowance?  The last part of the conversation about allowance is how much is appropriate. Some experts say $1 for each year of age, but this is a very personal decision based on your financial situation. When you are setting an amount, try to stick to that amount and pay your children in cash so they get used to handling money.  When you start giving your children cash, this is the perfect time to start the discussion of saving, sharing, and spending. Talk with them about saving for a special item, and about putting some of their money away for sharing with others, maybe they have a special organization they would like to help. I love the idea of three different containers so they can see the money inside, and watch it grow which is something we all love to see.  More Resources to Help You Talk to Your Kids About Money  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website has  Money As You Grow activities  to help you start the money conversation with your children, starting at age three. They have great games and activities to help you make learning fun and educational. You can print games and get ideas for starting the conversation based on your children's ages. With small children, you can start by identifying different coins. With teenagers, you'll think about buying a car and understanding credit cards. It is all free! '\""}

{"text": "If you lose your job, there are resources out there to help you stay afloat financially as you plan your next steps forward.  Eligibility and Applications  Unemployment benefits and eligibility requirements vary state-to-state, so  choose your state  to start the process of checking your eligibility and applying for benefits. Generally, unemployment benefits are available to workers who become unemployed \u201cthrough no fault of their own\u201d \u2013 which means that you may not be eligible if you were fired for cause or if you quit your job.  Other Related Benefits  Unemployment insurance is just one of the  benefits that you may be eligible for . To continue your group health insurance after leaving a job, you can enroll in COBRA continuation coverage. And if illness or injury prevents you from working, you can apply for short-term or long-term disability insurance.  Should I Apply?  If you believe you are eligible for unemployment benefits, but feel reluctant to apply, I encourage you to think about why you feel this way. Are you holding shame about being unemployed? It may be helpful to talk to someone you trust who can support you in applying for the benefits you're eligible to receive.  Take Action Now  Losing a job is a big event, and you may feel frightened or uncertain about the future. Acknowledge and deal with the emotions you're experiencing. If you need support, talk to a trusted friend.  As you figure out your next steps forward, address your budget now and make any necessary changes. Pay for necessities and contact your creditors if you need to.  Don't agree to pay more than you can afford  and  seek out any public benefits  that you're eligible for.  If you believe you are eligible for a benefit, be prepared to challenge if your claim is rejected.  Plan Your Transition  We all have transitions, so take this time to consider your vision for the next three months, six months, and beyond. What milestones do you hope to accomplish at these intervals?  Here are a few more questions I want you to think through:   What job-seeking requirements must you fulfill to be eligible for unemployment benefits?  What information or resources do you need?  How will you stay motivated through this transition period?  What will you do if or when you are no longer eligible for benefits?   Remember that bumps along your professional journey are seldom your final destination. Set realistic expectations for yourself given the economic and unemployment conditions in your geographic area and field. Then get the support you need and keep yourself on track. I'm rooting for you! '\""}
{"text": "One of the most common questions I get asked is about investing. How should I start investing? What investment options do you recommend? What is a low-risk investing option? Don't worry, we're going to get there. But first, let's start with something more basic.  Investing is a means to an end, not an end itself  Understanding how stocks and bonds work is pretty cut and dry, but the context matters \u2013 and in this case, the context is your financial situation and goals. I want you to start by going back to your \u201cwhy.\u201d What concrete financial goals do you have for your future?  Your goal could be buying a home, paying for your children or grandchildren to go to college, retiring at a certain age, or saving up to start your own business. Once you know this goal, you can figure out how much money you will need to accomplish it and when you will need this money.  Do you have your \u201cwhy\u201d ready? Let's dive in!  What are stocks?  When you buy a stock, you are investing in a company. If the company grows and the stock becomes more valuable, your investment will grow with it. However, if the company fails or becomes less valuable (which happens to companies every day), your stock could be worth less or even nothing.  What are bonds?  When you buy a bond, you are loaning money to a company. The company will then repay your loan with interest at a specific time. The company may also pay you dividends (a percentage of the company's earnings). Bonds are generally considered \u201csafer\u201d investments than stocks \u2013 less likely to lose all their value, but also less likely to increase hugely in value.  What is your risk tolerance?  The stock market as a whole goes up and down regularly. Sometimes it seems to go up, up, and up, and sometimes it plunges down. From 2000 to 2002, for example, the U.S. stock market lost about half of its value. Most investors agree that a big drop is inevitable at some point. So how willing are you to take on that risk? You have to think about the upside AND the downside when choosing to invest.  Creating your portfolio  So there are different types of investments, and those investments carry different levels of risks.   This image is modified from Smart About Money's  \u201cDetermining Your Risk Tolerance\u201d lesson .  Depending on your risk tolerance, you can fill your portfolio with an allocation of risky and safe assets that matches your preferences. Your portfolio should be part of your overall financial plan so take into consideration the status of your savings and ability to weather changes in the economy.  Remember that the \u201csafer\u201d investments carry a different kind of risk, which investors call  inflation risk . This is the risk that, over time, your money will have less buying power due to inflation. In the short run, you don't have to worry much about inflation; but over decades, inflation will significantly impact the buying power of your money if you keep that money in safe investment vehicles like cash.  Investing is just one piece of the puzzle  I hope you see that investing is not an end in itself. Whether you keep your money in cash or in the stock market, you are taking on certain risks. Remember to view investing as just one piece of your financial life and align it with your short- and long-term goals. While looking into investing, make sure you're taking care of yourself by maintaining an emergency fund and protecting your important assets.  My perspective on investing is inspired by a great resource called  Transparent Investing . I hope you check out the full guide if you're interested in learning more. All of the information here is for educational purposes and I encourage you to only take investment advice from a Certified Financial Planner\u00ae or another investment professional. '\""}
{"text": "If you're dealing with multiple loans, chances are you've heard of debt consolidation (think of those obnoxious radio or tv ads). But what exactly is debt consolidation? Put simply, debt consolidation allows you to consolidate all of your debts into one payment. This will combine all your debt amounts, and it  may  offer a lower interest rate \u2013  but not always .  Secured or Unsecured?  Debt consolidation comes in different forms, including secured and unsecured. If your debt consolidation is unsecured, that means that it is still a signature loan. If it is secured, you have to put up some asset (like a car or house) as collateral \u2013 which you are then at risk of losing. Some people use a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay off credit cards, but in my book, that's a big risk and can have many consequences including high costs and even foreclosure if you are unable to pay the debt.  Debt Consolidation, Debt Settlement, and Debt Management  There's a dizzying array of options out there that may help you with your debt. Debt  consolidation , settlement, and management all refer to different processes with different drawbacks and benefits.  Let's start with debt settlement. This is when you negotiate for a lower rate or balance. Debt management is when an intermediary company negotiates on your behalf with your creditors, then you pay the debt management company and they pay your creditors.  Questions to Ask Before Choosing Debt Consolidation  Depending on your circumstances and the options you have, debt consolidation may or may not be the right choice for you. Here are things I want you to think about and research in making your decision:   What are the fees?  What are the interest rates? Use a  Debt Consolidation Calculator  to check your consolidated rate. Be careful because the rate is sometimes higher on consolidation loans (and don't forget the fees!).  What is your budget? Use a calculator to make an honest assessment of what you can afford to pay towards debt reduction.  Do you have an emergency fund? Balancing debt reduction and saving is tricky \u2013 but my word of advice is to always  put  yourself  in the front of your line . Saving for emergencies, even a small amount, is a good habit to build.   DIY Debt Consolidation  Beyond the many debt consolidation options on the market, I want you to also consider building your own consolidation plan using zero interest cards or short term lower interest loans through a bank or credit union. But as always, make sure you're still asking yourself the central questions I've outlined above.  Your Money Mindset  I've often seen that consolidating debt actually leads to acquiring more debt: the newly consolidated debt plus new debt from continuing to use credit cards. Here's where your money mindset comes into play. Whether or not you opt to use debt consolidation, you may need to shift your behaviors to meet your financial goals and to be successful with tackling your debt. You may find that creating your own debt management plan is best for your money AND your mind.  Where to Learn More  Debt consolidation is complicated, and there's a lot to consider when deciding if it's right for you. Nolo, my go-to online resource for legal issues,  walks you through some additional important considerations , including a more in-depth comparison of choosing a secured or unsecured debt consolidation plan. Another great resource is  this article  from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  Whew! That is a TON of information on debt consolidation. Consolidating your debt is a big choice, and I want to make sure you're equipped to make the right decision for you. '\""}
{"text": "Hello, Saundra! How do I go about finding and choosing a certain type of loan (if one exists) that would enable me to quickly buy a cheap used car (around a couple thousand) that I could be able to pay back (with no job/income) with only the money I have saved from last semester's student loan refund and the following ones I'll be receiving each semester for next few years? I've tried searching for too long now to find a vehicle for $1,000 or under, but I've been unsuccessful. It's too difficult and I think it will be easier with a couple more thousand. Thank you in advance!  Submitted by Joan H.  First, congrats on saving that student loan refund! You are absolutely right that you will have more choices for a reliable car if you have additional cash. The question is, what price (the cost of money) will you pay for that cash?  My favorite choice for loans is the local credit union. When I was a (very broke) student I opened a savings account at a local credit union. For more than 10 years, I only had $10 in that account. They never cancelled the account even though I wasn't a profitable (fee paying) customer. Fast forward 20 years, they now hold my mortgage and they are my first choice for all loans.  So, where do you begin? If you don't have a banking relationship, consider opening an account with a credit union in your community. There are also online options, so you have many options. The interest rate on car loans is based on your credit score so check your credit reports before you apply so you know what to expect. If you need help with this step, contact a  reputable credit counseling agency .  You may have noticed that I did  not  recommend one of those auto dealers that offers credit at their store. That is a \u201cbuyer beware\u201d situation as the cost of credit (fees and interest) is usually very high. They often bait you with a low payment to distract from the high interest rate and total cost of the car.  Bottom line: A credit union or bank will be your best option for an auto loan. Try to secure funding before you shop to help you stay within your budget. Check out this  credit union website  for info on how to prepare for a purchase. Good luck and drive safely!

{"text": " When you start planning for Open Enrollment, your first question may be which metal level of health coverage is right for you. Health insurance plans in the  Marketplace  fall into  four metal-level tiers : Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze. These metal levels reflect the differences in how costs for your healthcare are split between you and your insurance company. Generally speaking, plans with higher premiums have lower annual deductibles. And plans with lower monthly premiums tend to come with high deductibles. Depending on the amount of medical costs you end up with in a year, different metal levels will offer different kinds of value to you.   The different metal tiers in no way reflect a difference in the level of care you receive.   Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, all Marketplace plans must cover the following 10 categories of  Essential Health Benefits :  Ambulatory patient services (outpatient care you get without being admitted to a hospital) Emergency services Hospitalization (like surgery and overnight stays) Pregnancy, maternity, and newborn care  (both before and after birth) Mental health and substance use disorder services , including behavioral health treatment (this includes counseling and psychotherapy) Prescription drugs Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices (services and devices to help people with injuries, disabilities, or chronic conditions gain or recover mental and physical skills) Laboratory services Preventive and wellness services  and chronic disease management Pediatric services, including oral and vision care (but adult dental and vision coverage aren't essential health benefits)  No matter which plan type you select, all Marketplace plans are Qualified Health Plans. And these plans must offer a  set of preventive care services  \u2013 including many vaccinations, cancer screenings, and birth control \u2013 for free when you visit an in-network healthcare provider, even if you haven't met your deductible yet.

{"text": " It can be so frustrating when you have more month than money! Everything is a battle and a challenge, just living day to day. The trick to getting out of that cycle is to make a plan for every single dollar. If you decide where you will spend your money before you receive it, you can make better choices and alleviate some of the stress.  Start With a Budget  Add up all of your income for the month. Next, subtract all your expenses. If you are unsure what those are, you need to do a little investigating. Start by going to your bank statement and pulling 30 days' worth of spending. Then categorize every purchase. You will have food, eating out, snacks and drinks, gas for your car, and any other category you find.    After you have recorded the entire 30 days, add up each column.  Now you know what to put in each expense of your budget. You will want to put your fixed expenses as well. Those are the ones that are the same every month, like rent and car payment. When you subtract all of your expenses from all of your income, do you have a negative number? If you live paycheck-to-paycheck, you probably do.  That means you need to review every line on your budget and determine if what you are spending money on is moving you in a direction you want to go. Sometimes, those small purchases day after day are what keep us from financial security. Is that cup of coffee from the coffee shop making you feel secure or would brewing a cup at home and saving the money make you feel better? Only you can answer that question.  Focus on Your Spending  Then you can find the extra money you need to start saving. Even if you can only save $5 a month, every little bit helps. Having a savings account to fall back on when a disaster strikes will keep you off the paycheck-to-paycheck merry-go-round.  If you are absolutely watching every dollar and still don't have enough to cover all your necessities, the other option is to add income. There are options other than a part time job (which of course would also help). Think about cleaning a friend's home twice a month, getting a roommate, or cleaning out that storage shed and having a sale. Brainstorm and come up with an idea that works for you. Think outside the box!  The choice is up to you. You are in control of your situation; you just have to be willing to make the necessary changes and make the hard choices. The good news is, this won't be forever. As you practice your money management skills and start to master them, you can get out of the paycheck-to-paycheck rut. '\""}
{"text": "    Sign up for SaverLife  to earn points and chances to win cash prizes when you read articles like this!  Establishing credit is important. Using credit over time creates a credit history (hopefully of on-time payments) that businesses use to decide if they will give you credit. Without a credit history, companies may be hesitant to give you credit because they are unsure if you will pay them back.  This may mean paying a higherinterest rate, having to pay a security deposit or even being denied loans forhomes or cars.  The following are five ways you can establish credit.  Get a credit card  BE CAREFUL! Most people tend to  spend more with credit cards . Credit cards can give you a false sense that you have more moneyto spend than you actually have.   If you get a credit card toestablish credit, consider the following suggestions:  Set-upautomatic payments, so you don't get a ding on your credit report for aforgotten late payment. Only use yourcredit card to pay small bills with predictable monthly payments, like acellphone or cable bill. Pay the credit card balance off monthly. Do not spendmore than 30% of your credit limit. How much of your overall credit limit youuse can affect your overall credit score.   Get a secured credit card  If youdo not qualify for a traditional credit card (unsecured credit card), you can geta secured credit card instead.\\\\xa0 A securedcredit card requires a deposit. That deposit is typically your credit cardlimit. Similar to an unsecured card, the rule of thumb is to only use 30% ofyour credit limit. Ask your creditor if they will report your payments to thecredit bureaus. Not all secure credit card companies report to credit bureaus.   Pay your student loans consistently  Your student loan servicer reportsyour loan information to credit bureaus. If you  cannot afford your payments , loan providers, particularly  federal loan providers , offer several options to help make your payment more affordable.  Auto installment loan  Use the 20/4/10 as a rule of thumbso you don't get a car you can't afford.  Make a 20%down payment Finance thecar for no more than four years Thetotal cost of a car  shouldn'texceed 10% of your income (car loan payment, insurance, fuel, warranties, and averagemonthly maintenance costs) If you cannotkeep your costs to 10% of your monthly income, commit to choosing a vehicle asclose to 10% of your monthly income as possible  Become an authorized user on someone else's credit card  Ask yourparents (assuming they have good credit) to make you an authorized user ontheir credit card. An authorized user can use another person's credit card intheir name. The primary account holder adds the authorized user to their creditcard account.   An authorizer user benefits fromhaving the primary account holder's credit payment history reported on theauthorized user's credit report. As the primary account holder makes on-timepayments, it may help you establish a good credit history.  A word of caution :  If the primary account holder does not pay their bills, the late payments will be reported on your credit report. In most cases, you will not be responsible for the credit card bill.  The bottom line  Establishing credit means using good credit habits, like paying your bills on time, over time to have a good credit score. As you work to establish credit, remember to use credit wisely so your hard work will help and not hurt your credit in the future.

{"text": " There are lots of articles written about cutting expenses in order to make your budget work. But there is an alternative. You can make more money to achieve the same desired result! Getting a side hustle, and bringing in more money each month, will correct the deficit of your budget just as quickly as spending less. You can also do a combination of both.  Side Hustle Ideas  A side hustle no longer has to be the traditional part-time job in addition to your full-time job. This approach will work of course, but let's consider some alternatives. The key is to find a need and fill it. A few ideas include:  Would you want to try dog sitting or dog walking? House cleaning a few times a month for a friend can net a couple hundred dollars.    What about selling items on the internet? There are several marketplaces where people sell all kinds of things. Driving for a car service allows you to choose your hours.  If you don't want people in your car, you can always deliver food. If you are a good candidate, you can donate plasma. Plasma centers will pay you for your time, and many offer free babysitting on-site for the time that you are in there. This is only a few hours a week. You can change your tax withholding. If you get a large tax return each year, consider visiting your HR department and asking them to help you adjust the amount of tax you are paying each month. There is no need to \u201clend\u201d your money to the government (at zero interest) all year, just to get it back in March or April of the next year. You need the money every month, so it should be available to you.  Think outside the box!  Ask your friends and colleagues if they have any ideas for you.

To find the true answer to this question, let's take a tour of our personal habits.  Enough? For who? Where? With what lifestyle? Will it be enough forever or will it change? How do we achieve this?  Lifestyle Inflation  Numerous studies indicate that the more income we have,  the more we are willing to spend . Thus, if someone loves to buy jeans and increases their income, they will spend more money either buying a more expensive brand, more pants, or both. Does this sound familiar?  The real question we should ask ourselves is: to what extent will I let an increase in income become a new expense? If we experience a sudden increase in income and we increase in equal proportion our expenses, we will have a new standard of what is necessary to live. The problem with this vicious cycle is that it's easy to acquire a new spending habit but a lot harder to abandon it. At the same time, we also can't guarantee that we will always maintain our \u201chigher\u201d income.  Income is One Piece of the Puzzle  The question becomes more psychological than financial. While being human gives us the ability to adapt to changes, the process is rarely simple. For example, we can always sell our vehicle and travel by public transportation, but this may make us spend more time getting from Point A to Point B and cause stress for various other reasons.    Finding a balance between our income and our expenses determines our financial success. We have to differentiate between what we want and what we need to live. We may not have enough income for everything we want in life, but can almost certainly say that we'll have enough to satisfy our needs.   There's no mathematical equation or magic response that can answer the question of how much income you need. Common sense must reign in each of our decisions. So now, what is your next move?

{"text": " I'm going to suggest something a little radical for the new year and the new decade, 2020. Instead of focusing on a new year's resolutions, consider listing the things you are going to  stop  doing. Ideally, these should be self-sabotaging habits and behaviors that prevent you from achieving your goals.  Here are a few ideas to get you started:  1. Let Go of Unsupportive People  You will stop (or reduce) your communications with unsupportive people. Anyone who truly cares about you also cares about what's important to you, including your goals. Beware of people who discourage you from sticking to your goals. I genuinely believe this is why the \u201cunfollow\u201d button and the ability to send calls straight to voicemail exist. Be intentional with who you invite into your life. There are amazing private Facebook groups with people trying to achieve your goals; join one. Find a local support group, a Bible study group, your group of people. I like to call these your \u201cbattle buddies.\u201d These are people with shared goals and similar struggles. You can encourage each other.  2. Break Up With Your Credit Card  You will stop buying items with a credit card. It's tough to pay off credit debt when you are still using a credit card. You tend to spend, on average, 25% more when you use a credit card instead of cash. Consider committing to using your debit card for expenses and using only cash in areas you typically overspend in (eating out, groceries, clothing, etc.).  3. Stop De-Prioritizing Saving  You will stop putting savings at the bottom of your to-do list. Putting money into your savings should be at the top of your spending plan. There will never be a good time to start saving. Consider using payroll deductions to have a portion of your paycheck go directly into your savings account, so you don't have to think about it. Remember, it's more about the habit of saving first rather than the actual amount you save.  4. Never Shop Without a List  You will stop going to the grocery store without a shopping list. I have never heard of anyone who considers a trip to the grocery store to be a stress-reducing experience. It's crowded, overwhelming, and no matter what time you go, it's an inconvenience. First, shop your pantry and refrigerator. I cannot tell you how many times I bought something I already had, or I already had all the ingredients for a meal. Next, think through the meals you want to make. You can easily find budget-friendly meals online. You don't have to get fancy. Start with a few quick meals like spaghetti or hamburgers. The point is to limit your meals out.  Hopefully this gets you thinking about what you may need to stop doing in 2020. Take the time for a little self-reflection and commit to stopping self-sabotaging habits. This can go a long way to helping you reach your goals! '\""}
{"text": " Note : This article is about the first stimulus payments as part of the CARES Act from March 2020. Learn more about the  second  and  third  rounds of stimulus payments.  How does the stimulus check work?  The coronavirus stimulus check is an advance on a 2020 tax credit. This means if you do not get a check in 2020, you may be able to claim the tax credit next year. The IRS calls this check an \u201ceconomic impact payment.\u201d  The amount you get will be based on your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) from the last tax return you filed, either 2018 or 2019. AGI is your total income minus a handful of deductions such as pre-taxed retirement contributions, 1/2 self-employment tax, HSA deductions, etc.  Who qualifies for a stimulus check?  You might qualify for a check even if you did not earn enough to file a return. You must have a Social Security number for you, your spouse, and any qualifying children.  Undocumented workers, dependents that can be claimed on someone else's tax returns, and \u201cnon-resident aliens\u201d are generally are not eligible to receive a check.  Do I need to file a tax return?  You must file a tax return to get a check. You may be able to electronically file for free through  IRS Free File . The IRS will provide information on filing a simple tax return for people who typically do not file a tax return.   The exceptions to this requirement as of this writing are the following:  People who get Social Security, Rail Retirement benefits, or disability benefits may be eligible for a check without filing a tax return. The government will base the check amount on the SSA-1099 or the RRB-1099.  How will I receive the stimulus check?  Payments will be electronically deposited if you provided direct deposit information to the IRS. If not, then the IRS will mail your check. The IRS plans to develop an  online portal  for people to provide banking information. For now, Intuit TurboTax is offering a free  Stimulus Registration portal  for non-tax filers to share their mailing address or direct deposit information.  As of March 31, 2020, the IRS plans to start distributing checks in April. The IRS suggests checking the  IRS Coronavirus website  for updates instead of calling the IRS.  How much money could I receive?  If you are filing as\u2026  single and your AGI is $75,000 or less married and your AGI is $150,000 or less head of household and your AGI is $112,000 or less  \u2026 you could receive:  $1,200 if you're single $2,400 if you're married  $500 for each child under 17 years old  If your AGI is higher than the cutoffs above, your payment may be lowered by $50 for every additional $1,000 that you make.  Estimate your possible Stimulus Check using  this calculator .  What should I do with my check?  The purpose of this check is for you to be able to cover essential expenses\u2014 food, shelter, and transportation\u2014while our country is impacted by COVID-19. Until we know the long-range impact of COVID-19, save if you can and use the money for essential expenses. '\""}

{"text": " Do you find yourself falling behind and not able to live within your means? If you're not sure if you're living beyond your means, check out my recent article where I help you  figure out if you need to make some changes .  Here are some solutions to help you live within your means and improve your financial situation:  1. Track Your Spending  It's easy to lose track of what you spend, especially when you use credit cards, debit cards, and automatic bill pay. While those methods are convenient, they hinder our ability to determine how much we are actually spending. Ideally, you should track your spending for 30 days. Track every penny so that you can get an accurate accounting of where your money is going. Tracking how you spend your money over a 30-day period is useful for creating an accurate spending plan.  2. Create a Spending Plan  A spending plan is a great way to evaluate your income and expenses. To create an effective spending plan, you must be honest about your spending habits. Look for ways to reduce expenses and/or increase income.  Read more about creating the perfect budget for you.  3. Set Up Your Emergency Fund Before Paying Your Debt  You need to be prepared for emergencies. If you are using all of your extra income to pay down debt and an emergency occurs, you will end up taking on more debt, the exact opposite of what you want. I recommend saving between 5% \u2013 10% of your net (take home) pay before you put extra money towards debt.  4. Pay Off Credit and Loans Using the Snowball Method  This snowball method is relatively simple and psychologically satisfying.  You pay off the smaller debt first and make your way up to the larger debts. This method may not be the most cost-effective, but it helps motivate you towards debt freedom as you feel accomplished every time you eliminate debt.   Note that you should typically pay off high-interest debt first. Credit cards are usually a great place to start due to their high-interest rates. If you're highly motivated, I recommend starting with high-interest debt and working your way down. This is called the  avalanche method .   5. Use Cash  Using cash is a great way to stick to your budget. Why? You can only spend as much as you have. Swiping a credit card is easy, but limiting yourself to a specific amount of cash is an effective way to get your spending habits in line with your spending goals.  With hard work and commitment, you can  live debt-free ! '\""}
{"text": " Many people don't even realize that they have a money sink, much less what their money sinks are. We are so heavily marketed to and conditioned to spend in America. Using a debit or credit card feels so removed from real money that it doesn't even feel like spending. It's easy to spend without paying attention.  If you want to find the leak in your budget, take these steps. You might be surprised at what you find.   Step 1: Take an Inventory of Your Spending  Go to your checking account and pull up 30 days' worth of spending.  It doesn't matter what 30 days, just as long as they are consecutive. Every time money came out of your account during that time frame, categorize it by writing it down in a category. Some common categories are food, entertainment, gas, and rent or house payment. Feel free to make any category that fits your spending habits.   Next, add up all the categories. Is there one that made you say \u201cWOW! I had no idea I spend that much on (fill in the blank)!\u201d That is the money sink or leak in your wallet.  Step 2: Reflect on Your Goals  Ask yourself, \u201cDoes this spending move me towards my financial goals?\u201d If not, you have just discovered the money sink that you should cut out or reduce in order to save more. Now is the time to decide to do something about it. Sometimes, it's easier than you think. If you stop every morning for coffee, you could be spending over $1,000 a year just for that one item. By simply preparing a cup of coffee at home, putting it in a travel mug, and taking it with you, you have stopped that leak. Now you have money to put towards your emergency fund or financial goals. You also still have the caffeine you need to get your day started.  Step 3: Remember to Enjoy Life  It's important to note that if it's something you really want, it's okay to have it! Make sure you are purchasing it in a manner that is reasonable and doesn't damage your long-term goals.  '\""}
{"text": " I've been paying my bills every month on time and nothing changes on Credit Karma. I feel like I'm stalking the app. What should I do?  Submitted by Michelle S.  Congrats on paying your bills on time! Can we just celebrate that for a moment?  What Impacts Your Credit Score  Paying your bills will not reflect your credit score unless those bills are payments on your loans. Utility bills are not reported on a credit report unless you don't pay for a long time and they get sent to collections.  Improving your credit score can take time, so determine if checking frequently is good for you emotionally. Each credit bureau has their \u201csecret sauce\u201d of how they calculate your credit score, taking in multiple factors (not just payment) to reach the final number.   How to Use Credit Karma  Credit Karma is a tool to help you monitor your score and items that are reported to Transunion and Equifax. The credit reporting agencies ultimately are the companies that lenders report to, and how they do so affects your score.  Credit Karma may offer suggestions for banking products that could help you, but be careful with these. The products they refer are their way of getting paid. That's how the app is free for members (if an app is free, you are the product). If you want to use the information that Credit Karma gives you to improve your credit and FICO score, check out  these tips .  History Matters Too  It is equally important, or even more important, to show good history on your report. When you establish a pattern of paying what you owe, financial institutions take this into consideration regardless of your score.  Your credit score drives your interest rate, but your history will ultimately determine if a financial institution will approve you for a loan. If your report is clean and accurate, your score will rise as you pay your credit accounts on time.  You can check your credit report for free through  AnnualCreditReport  every 12 months for all three credit reporting agencies: Transunion, Equifax, and Experian. '\""}
{"text": " Sometimes you don't realize it is going to happen. You are expecting your tax refund and it never arrives. You may ask your tax professional or call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040.   Here's what may have happened: they kept the refund because your spouse owes money. This is often back taxes, both federal and state. But it can also be student loan debt, child support, or other government debt.   What Can I Do?  In some cases, you can set up a payment plan so that you can receive future tax refunds. In some cases, couples decide to file Married Filing Separate for future tax filings. But if you pay to file your taxes, this can increase costs to file. More importantly, this can cause you to lose out on credits or deductions that aren't allowed when filing Married Filing Separate.  Also, this solution doesn't help you  now .   What is the Injured Spouse Allocation?  Fortunately, there is another path. And you can do this with your tax return or afterwards if you don't realize the issue until after the return is filed. The IRS has a tax form for this situation. It is  Form 8379 Injured Spouse Allocation . You can file this form with your tax return, with an amendment, or separately after your tax return is filed. \u201cInjured spouse\u201d in this case doesn't mean physical or mental injuries. It means that one person's debt is affecting the \u201cinjured\u201d spouse's share of the tax refund. Form 8379 is used to allocate a portion of the refund to the spouse. It is possible that the IRS will determine a different number than you or your tax professional determines by using the form.   Downsides of Injured Spouse Allocation  The disadvantage of the injured spouse form is that it adds to the processing time. When filed with your joint tax return it can mean it will take 11 to 14 weeks to process your tax return. A Form 8379 filed after a joint tax return is processed can take about 8 weeks to process. Realize that it also slows down the pay-off of the debt. Form 8379 has to be filed each year when filing a joint return if one spouse has debt that is subject to collections from the refund.   Is Injured Spouse Allocation Right for You?  The Injured Spouse option can be very helpful because it often allows you to make sure a large portion of the refund is still received. And preserving some of the refund for you to use can make the longer processing time worth it.  One final point: if you have debt that your refund may be directed towards involuntarily, you may want to let your spouse know before it happens. I've found that this is one surprise that spouses don't like! '\""}
{"text": " In a time of \u201cbuy now pay later,\u201d it's easy to fall into spending habits that lead to debt. We don't even need to leave our homes to make large purchases, making reckless purchasing even easier.   Here are five warning signs that you may be living beyond your means:  1. You Aren't Saving At Least 10% of Your After-Tax Income  We are all advised to save at least 10-15% of our income. If you can't save 10%, then you may be living beyond your means. Savings instruments include 401(k) contributions, emergency fund contributions, investments, and deposits into your bank account.   2. You Have No Emergency Fund  Part of the reason you need to save at least 10% is to have cash set aside for the inevitable emergency. Putting emergencies on your credit card or taking out a loan will continue the cycle of living beyond your means. I recommend that you have 3-6 months' worth of your monthly expenses set aside.  3. You're Living Paycheck to Paycheck  If you find yourself with more month than money, you are living beyond your means. Many people believe they do not have the required salary to set aside savings or cannot afford to reduce their current lifestyle.   4. You Use Credit Cards or Take Out Loans to Pay Bills  Believe it or not, many people borrow money to pay their bills. This is a clear sign that you cannot afford your current lifestyle. If you find yourself not being able to afford food, toiletries, and clothes, it's time to see if you can make changes.   5. You're Afraid Your Friends Will Judge You  Social media can wreak havoc on your wallet. Do you ever find yourself buying items to please others? Do you buy items just to post a picture on social media? Evaluate what you really need and stop trying to impress others.   If you think you may be living beyond your means, congratulations! That's the first step to making a change. Next, I'm going to walk you through the  tips I use with my clients  to help them make and execute a plan to live within their means. '\""}
{"text": "A savings account is one of the simplest bank accounts you can get. Nearly all U.S banks and credit unions offer savings accounts. It's worth it to shop around because accounts have varying fees, minimum balances, and interest rates. Keep the following things in mind when selecting an account.  FDIC Deposit Insurance  You should only bank with financial institutions that are FDIC insured. FDIC insurance protects customer bank deposits up to $250,000 per depositor in the event of bank failure. If a financial institution doesn't have FDIC protection, pass on it.  Monthly Fees  Read the fine print before opening a new savings account. Some banks will charge fees and you need to know what they are up front. Here are examples of some fees you may encounter:   Account maintenance or administration fees  Withdrawal penalty fees  Minimum balance penalty fees  Deposit penalty fees  ATM use fees  Account link/online banking fees   If your bank does charge any of these fees (not all do), ask your account manager if you can get a fee waiver.  Online Account Access  Today, almost every banking institution has an online presence. You want to make sure you can sign in and access your savings account online so you can bank when, where, and how you want to. Plus, SaverLife only works with savings account that have online access!  Automatic Transfers  Setting up automatic fund transfers to your savings account is one of the best ways to easily save money each month. Make sure that your financial institution and savings account has this capability.  Interest Rates  Financial institutions have varying interest rates so make sure to comparison shop before settling on an account as you'll want to earn the most competitive savings rate possible. Interest rates at most financial institutions are low right now (generally 2% or less) but it's still worth it to get the best rate possible. '\""}
{"text": " New to being an independent contractor? Here's what you need to know about taxes.  Being an independent contractor or gig worker comes with more flexibility. It also comes with new tax responsibilities.  At a high level, the IRS considers you an independent contractor, and therefore self-employed. You are paid for the result of your work, not for how or when you do it. The \u201cself-employed\u201d status generally translates into higher tax rates and more cumbersome tax filing. But it also generates some potential new tax deductions.  Let's walk through some things you need to know about taxes as an independent contractor.  You'll be paying a new tax: self-employment tax  If you're self-employed, you pay self-employment tax (approximately 15% of your net business income) and federal income tax directly to the IRS. The self-employment tax includes Social Security and Medicare taxes. This generally means that you'll pay a higher tax rate.  Quarterly estimated tax payments  You probably need to make quarterly tax payments to the IRS. This is especially important if you believe you'll owe more than $1,000 in income tax when you file. These payments represent an estimate of what you will owe in taxes for a given year based on your projected income and deductions. They are typically due to the IRS on April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15. These payments can be a big burden for new contractors, as you are now responsible for withholding your own taxes on income and paying them at the appropriate times. It's important to pay throughout the year so you don't end up short on cash or with a tax penalty at tax time.  The IRS has more information on  determining and paying your quarterly estimated tax payments .  New tax forms  You'll generally receive and use new tax forms. As an independent contractor, you need to file your own business taxes on Form 1040 (the standard tax return). You'll use a Schedule C to report income and expenses and a Schedule SE to determine your self-employment tax. You may need to fill out new state and local tax forms as well.  Whenever you receive $400 or more of income, you should receive a Form 1099 (instead of a W-2 for employees) at tax time that you must report when filing your income taxes. However, you may not always receive official tax forms to track your income. You are still liable to report all of your income, so you'll need to keep your own records. See the  IRS's Tax Guide for Small Business  for more information on federal tax laws and the self-employed.  Tracking your income and documenting your expenses  Being self-employed requires a lot of organization and documentation. You need to set up financial systems for tracking your income, documenting your expenses, regularly setting aside money for taxes, and paying your estimated tax bills on time.  You may start with a simple Excel spreadsheet for tracking your business finances. If it's getting too complicated, consider budgeting software like QuickBooks or Quicken or expense trackers like Expensify or Stride. Carefully track your expenses to maximize your eligible tax deduction and minimize your tax liability.   From the start, establish a separate savings account for your taxes. Set aside at least 20% of your income in that account to be able to pay your taxes on time and in full.  Business-related deductions  You may be able to get some new tax breaks from business-related deductions to reduce your federal income tax obligation. Along with the new tax responsibilities of being an independent contractor come a few tax benefits. Namely, expenses that might otherwise be considered \u201cpersonal\u201d can be deducted as business expenses. These include services, items, or amenities you use for business purposes. Some common examples are phone and internet, office supplies, use of your personal vehicle, a portion of rent, certain meals, and health insurance.  Business deductions effectively reduce your business's taxable income and could lower how much you owe in federal income tax. But deductions have their limits. To understand the rules of deducting business expenses, see this  guide from the IRS .  Is an accountant right for you?  You may want to hire an accountant to protect yourself. A certified public accountant will understand how federal taxes work. They can help you manage your new responsibilities, avoid costly mistakes and tax problems, take advantage of available deductions, make filing your taxes easier, decrease your overall tax liability, and safeguard the health and longevity of your business. While an accountant is an extra cost, it can also provide peace of mind and might be a worthwhile expense.  Saving for retirement  When you are feeling established as an independent contractor, consider starting a retirement account. Self-employed people have some unique options when it comes to retirement savings that aren't available to employees. A SEP-IRA is one option. It allows self-employed people to set aside significantly more than in other accounts, providing you with deductions on your tax return while building your retirement savings. It's wise to consult a financial planning professional before making investment decisions. I would recommend a  fee-only advisor  (who is compensated directly by you for advice).  More resources for independent contractors  For more information, the IRS has online tax centers on its website for  small businesses and the self-employed  and  those working in the gig economy .

{"text": " Our Federal tax code is complicated. One thing this causes is misunderstandings of tax law. I like to call these misunderstandings \u201ctax myths.\u201d Like many myths, tax myths often have some truth in them. Let's look at three common tax myths.  1. I Don't Want to Go Up to a New Tax Bracket  Sometimes people think that if they go up a Federal tax bracket, all of their income will be taxed at the higher rate. This is not true. Let's look at the first two brackets for filing single in 2020. If your taxable income (after deductions) is $9,875 or less, your tax rate is 10% on this money. But if your taxable income goes up to $20,875, then you are squarely in the 12% tax bracket. That means that $9,875 is subject to the 10% tax rate. The extra $11,000 is subject to the 12% tax rate.  Also, tax credits can lower your effective tax rate, even down to zero. Higher income can cause your taxes to go up and can reduce some tax credits. But if you make more money, you will have more money!  2. Don't Worry, I'll Deduct It  This statement implies that your expense won't actually cost you anything. That is rarely the case. If your marginal tax rate is 12%, then in most cases if you spend $100 that is deductible, you will only get $12 of it \u201cback\u201d through your tax return. And that is assuming it is really deductible.  In the gig economy, many of us have self-employed income. If you have self-employed or business income, you can deduct qualifying expenses. The key is the word \u201cqualifying.\u201d You should know if something is deductible or not before deducting it, or better yet before the spending. Also, if you aren't self-employed and you aren't in the position to itemize, meaning you take the standard deduction instead of adding up Schedule A deductions, then most likely you can't deduct more than the  new $300 charitable contribution  above the line deduction ($600 for MFJ filers for tax year 2021 and beyond).   3. I'll Buy a House to Reduce Taxes  Most realtors are great people. They help other people realize their dreams. But every year I sit down with clients who are excited about getting the tax benefit for the house they bought. And for most of those clients I have to tell them that the house isn't going to help them with their taxes. Many say, \u201cBut my realtor said I would save on taxes!\u201d That is true only if you are in the position to itemize on the Schedule A and if itemizing will get you higher than the standard deduction. You can either itemize or take the standard deduction. The most typical things people itemize on a Federal return are:   Mortgage interest paid Real estate taxes State and local taxes Charitable contributions There are more, but they are less common  For filing head of household in 2020, those would have to add up to more than $18,650. It would be $24,800 for Married Filing Jointly. Most of us aren't in the position to itemize that much. So most of us shouldn't be buying a house to \u201csave on taxes.\u201d  ***  Please leave this article with this recommendation: if someone tells you something about taxes, make sure it is correct before making a decision based on that information. You need to figure out whether it's relevant for you and your situation. If you have access to a tax professional, then consult them. If you don't,  IRS.gov  has loads of information organized into tax topics and in their publications.  '\""}

{"text": " Times are uncertain right now. Budgets are tightening and people are losing work. On March 27, 2020 President Trump signed the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act. Now people are trying to understand how the CARES Act will affect their lives.  If you have student loans, you may wonder how the CARES Act can give you some relief and free up money for more pressing financial issues. The good news is that the CARES Act does offer help for those with federally held student loans.  What the CARES Act Does for Federal Student Loans  The CARES Act has two big impacts on federally held student loans. This means if you filled out the FAFSA and borrowed loans as a result, your loans might be affected.  The first thing that the CARES Act does is set interest on student loans to 0% through September 30, 2020. So, over the next six months, your federally held student loans will accrue no interest will accrue. Loans covered in the 0% interest rate program include:  Defaulted and non-defaulted Direct Loans Defaulted and non-defaulted FFEL Program Loans Federal Perkins Loans  Some FFEL Program Loans and some Perkins loans are not owned by the federal government but by commercial lenders or your school. If this is the case, these loans are not eligible for this benefit at this time.  The second thing that the CARES Act does is place all federally held student loans into National Emergency Forbearances. A forbearance is a temporary suspension of loan payments. In this case, the suspension runs from March 13, 2020 through September 30, 2020. During this six-month time period no payments will be due on your federal student loans. If you made a payment after March 27 and would like a refund, request one from your loan servicer.  How National Emergency Forbearance Works  Usually, for your student loans to go into forbearance, you (the borrower) must request action. However, that is not the case with National Emergency Forbearance. This program will be enacted automatically. Whether you previously had your loans on automatic payment or paid each month, no payments should be due.  You should still check the status of your loans with your servicer. If a payment is still showing up as due, reach out to your servicer.   How the Temporary Suspension Affects Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)  If you are in the  Public Service Loan Forgiveness program  (PSLF), you may be wondering how the temporary suspension will affect your progress toward the necessary 120 payments required for forgiveness. The good news is that if you were on a qualifying repayment plan for your Direct Loan prior to the suspension and work for a qualifying employer full-time during the suspension, you will receive credit during the suspension for qualifying, on-time payments towards PSLF.  Making Payments During National Emergency Forbearance  If you can make some or all of your student loan payments and would like to do so, you still can during the forbearance period. Your payments will be applied directly toward the principal once you have paid off all unpaid interest. If your loans were on automatic payment prior to the suspension you can go to your account with your servicer and make manual payments or you can ask to have automatic payment resumed.  ~  It's important to understand how the CARES Act affects your federal student loans and how it might free up money for you during this time. As budgets adjust, understanding that you have a temporary suspension on your loan payments will hopefully allow money to flow to other necessities. Just be sure that your contact information is updated with your loan servicer so you will receive the notifications to resume payments in October. And if your income changes in the fall and you are unable to make your full student loan payment, reach out to your servicer regarding an Income Based Repayment plan. '\""}
{"text": " Many of us dread filing our taxes, yet we look forward to receiving a tax refund. Those of us with families often use those funds to provide for them.  However, besides paying bills, buying necessities, and using it as fun money, I'd like you to consider using some or all of your refund to improve your long-term financial health.  1. Make extra debt payments  Having debt reduces your options. Paying off your debt allows you to enjoy your tax refund every month of the year! You'll have more room in your budget for your other financial priorities. And using that money for debt may be a jump start on the path of  becoming debt-free .   2. Boost your savings  Maybe you could use some more money in your emergency fund. Maybe you need to save for your next car.  If you struggle with spending money that is sitting in your bank account, there is another option. When you file your Federal tax return, you can choose to apply your refund or a portion of your refund to US Savings Bonds, I bonds. The I bonds have some inflation protection and the portion of the refund designated for the savings bonds won't pass through your bank account. Note that you can't cash in I bonds for the first year and there is an interest penalty if cashed in before 5 years. Your tax software or tax professional may offer this option. If they don't, look for or ask for Form 8888 to direct some of your refund to I bonds. You can also use Form 8888 to direct your refund to multiple accounts. For example, you can direct some of your refund directly to your savings account and send the money you plan to spend to your checking account.   3. Boost your retirement investing  Your future self will thank you if you contribute to your retirement fund! I still haven't met anyone who said they saved too much for retirement, but if this is you, please let me know.   4. Bonus \u2013 Plan for your taxes next year  You may be able to lower your tax refund by reducing your tax withholding during the year. This could result in more take-home money each paycheck. This may help you manage your monthly bills or savings. You do this by adjusting your W-4 with your employer. The IRS has kindly provided a  withholding estimator  to help you determine the best way to fill out your W-4. Should you decide to make adjustments, remember that if you have changes in employment and/or income you should revisit the withholding estimator to avoid any surprises.   ***  The most important thing about the tax refund is to use it in a way that is best for you. But when your budget supports, please consider these options that may help you be in a better financial position. '\""}
{"text": " Stop! Don't know where to start when it comes to claiming the Child Tax Credit?  Take our short quiz to find out .  The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 really helped many taxpayers with 2020 Federal income taxes. But there are also tax changes for the tax year 2021 that will impact many taxpayers. One of these changes is an expansion of the Child Tax Credit for those eligible for the credit in 2021. Here is the summary of the changes:  How the Child Tax Credit Is Changing  The credit is  fully refundable . This means that taxpayers who didn't receive the full child tax credit in previous years due to their low or no tax liability may receive the full tax credit and higher tax refunds.  Even those who earned $0 income in 2021 may be eligible .  \\\\xa0  The credit will  include children who turn 17 in 2021 . In previous years, children who turned 17 during the tax year did not qualify the taxpayer for the child tax credit. This is the  only change  to who is a qualifying child for this tax credit.  The credit amount will increase for many taxpayers . The increased amount starts to phase out (be reduced) for incomes over $150,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return and qualifying widows or widowers, $112,500 for heads of household, and $75,000 for all other taxpayers.  The child tax credit is $3000 for ages 6 to 17 (up from $2000) and is $3600 (up from $2000) for under 6 .  Payments will start in July and go through December and will be based on the 2020 tax return filing (2019 if you haven't filed 2020 in time for the IRS to start the payments).  It's not too late to sign up. Many families with children are eligible for this crucial tax relief \u2013 including those who have not made enough money to be required to file taxes.  The IRS has a way for non-filers to receive the Child Tax Credit.  Another change that in particular may requires some tax planning for taxpayers is the monthly payment from July-December. If you don't want to get the advance child tax credit payments or if you want to update the information that the IRS is basing the payments on, the IRS will be providing a method to opt-out or to make those changes.   An Example of How the Advance Child Tax Credit Works  Let's say you have two qualifying children ages 7 and 8, and you qualify to get the full Child Tax Credit and the expanded amount. Your total Child Tax Credit would be $6,000. You will receive $3,000 over 6 months, so $500 a month from July through December. This can be very helpful for many people.  However, it may cause a problem. You'll only get $3,000 of the Child Tax Credit when you file your tax return ($6,000 \u2013 $3,000= $3,000). In previous years, you may have received $4,000. If you are used to receiving a $4,000 Child Tax Credit with your tax return but receive a $3,000 tax credit, it may cause you a problem. If you typically get say an $8,000 refund but instead get $7000, maybe that isn't so bad. But if you typically get a $500 refund and now owe $500, that may be a problem.  What to Watch Out for with the Advance Child Tax Credit  And there can be other complications. Let's say you claimed a child with the Child Tax Credit for the tax year 2020, but are not claiming the child for the tax year 2021. If you do nothing, you'll receive an advance tax credit that you won't claim on your tax return. You could end up getting a significantly reduced refund or even owing a substantial amount of money. If you get an advance on the Child Tax Credit for a child you don't claim on your 2021 tax return, the IRS will expect you to pay it back via your tax return.   Parents alternating which parent claims a child each year may be the most common circumstance in which a taxpayer may receive the advance child tax credit payments when they won't be claiming the child. If you claimed a child for the tax year 2020 but the other parent will claim them for the tax year 2021, it would probably be wise to opt-out of the advance child tax credit payments when the IRS provides the method to opt-out.

{"text": "  COVID-19 has wreaked havoc in all of our lives, disrupting our normal way of living. Many of you may have been laid off, or have severely reduced work hours as a result, yet you still have to maintain your homes and feed your families. One of the basic necessities that will continue is food.  I want to share ways to keep your grocery bill down during the COVID-19 pandemic:   1. Plan your meals ahead  Create a weekly family menu. Start with what you already have in your refrigerator and cabinets and figure out what extra ingredients you need.  2. Stick with your favorites  Stick with basic meals, nothing fancy. This may not be a great time to experiment with new exotic recipes that your family may or may not like.  3. Create a shopping list  Before you're ready to go grocery shopping, create a grocery list, and stick to it. Don't be tempted to splurge.  4. Use coupons  Check your Sunday newspapers to get started. You can also go online to access digital coupons. You can print the ones you want to use to take with you to the grocery store.  5. Try these grocery store hacks  Bring your own bags (BYOB). It may not be much, but every cent matters! Ask the store manager about their sale cycles. Check unit prices to see what is the best deal. The price label will tell you how much an item cost per ounce, pound, or piece. Buy generic or store brands. Pass on the name-brand items. Buy \u201cmust go\u201d and \u201cmust sell\u201d items. You will find these in the bakery, meat department, and dairy section. Trade in your fresh vegetables for frozen vegetables. They cost less and will last longer. Without hoarding, purchase staple and pantry items in bulk, especially if they're on sale: things like pasta, rice, beans, cereal (hot and cold), sugar, flour, corn meal, and canned goods.  6. Have a single-dish meal once a week  7. Try meatless Mondays  8. Redefine dinner  Instead of your dinner standards, you can try a hot breakfast or lunch for dinner.  9. Make leftovers  Repurpose your leftover dinners for lunch the next day.  10. Partner shop  Shop with someone else from your household, like a roommate or family member. Share the cost and split the groceries.  ~  These tips should put a significant dent in your grocery bill and give you some breathing room. These are also practices you can maintain even when life returns to normal. The money you don't spend on groceries, you can add to your savings!

{"text": " If you've ever been in the situation where you have to decide whether to pay for your prescription or put groceries on the table, you know how scary that can be. What many people don't know is that there are several programs that can help you pay for those prescriptions. They are called Patient Assistance Programs (PAP).   What Is a Patient Assistance Program?  PAPs are usually sponsored by the pharmaceutical companies. They are designed to help those who have no insurance or are even under insured.  But these companies aren't the only ones who offer help. Many states and non-profits have programs as well.  Who Qualifies for Patient Assistance Programs?  Qualifications can vary, but most PAPs will require you to be a permanent, legal resident of the United States or Puerto Rico. You must prove you are uninsured or your insurance doesn't cover your prescription. There are also income requirements. Since there are no standard qualifications, I recommend searching for more than one PAP to find one that can help you.  How to Find a Patient Assistance Program  The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has put together an  extensive list of PAPs . This is a good place to get started. It includes not only pharmaceutical companies, but also state programs and non-profit programs. The research team at GoodRx says if you aren't sure where to start, put the name of your prescription and \u201csavings program\u201d into your search engine. This will bring up options for you to explore.    I know personally of a woman who had a debilitating disease and was no longer able to work. She needed a drug that would cost her over $17,000 a month. Because of the Patient Assistance Program from the manufacturer, she was able to get it for free!  Before you decide not to fill your prescription because of lack of funds, look into a PAP to see if there is support available. '\""}
{"text": " A few months ago, I didn't even know how to pronounce coronavirus (COVID-19), and couldn't have imagined how quickly our world would change. Now it's part of our daily vocabulary and has impacted every area of our economy.  If you are affected by the crisis, first, I am so sorry. Although it may feel like things are out of control, there are steps you can take that are 100% in your control and there are resources out there to help.  The Triangle of Survival  In this scary time, I want you to focus on the \u201cTriangle of Survival.\u201d This means food, shelter, and transportation. If your income is limited, survival is your first financial priority. Having food on the table and paying your rent or mortgage, your utilities, car payment, and insurance come first. Everything else comes second.  If you are struggling to pay your rent, food, and utilities, contact  2-1-1 . A representative will provide a list of local agencies to assist you.  Below are resources for assistance with different types of bills.  Mortgage Assistance  As of this writing, more and more mortgage lenders are offering relief for people impacted by the Coronavirus. If you cannot make a mortgage payment or think you may have a problem making a mortgage payment in the future due to a loss of income, immediately contact your mortgage provider about hardship programs. If you don't get help from the first representative you speak to, ask for a supervisor.  On March 18, 2020, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  suspended foreclosures and evictions  from FHA-insured single-family properties until at least the end of April. Contact your lender for more information and eligibility.  Rental Assistance  If you can't pay your rent, let your landlord know as quickly as possible. Ask if you can make payment arrangements for partial rent or pay the missed rent in the future over time. Ask for a waiver of late fees due to the current crisis.  Several counties around the country have suspended evictions and have directed landlords to give tenants up to six months to repay any unpaid rents. Contact your county for more information. Reach out to organizations such as United Way's 211, local churches, and non-profits for assistance.  Need Help Paying Bills  offers a ton of resources to help.  Utilities Assistance  Several utility providers are allowing customers who have been directly impacted by COVID-19 to defer payments, set up payment plans, and not disconnect services. For more information and eligibility requirements, contact your service provider. Reach out to United Way or call  2-1-1  for help paying utilities.  Credit Card Assistance  If you don't get help from the first representative you speak to, ask for the supervisor or the Hardship Department. Bankrate.com has a growing list of  credit card companies offering support  during this crisis.  Car Payment Assistance  Just like credit cards, reach out to your lender if you experience a drop in income that will impact your ability to make your car payment. Auto loan creditors like Ford, Nissan, Hyundai, General Motors, and Toyota may allow you to defer payments. Contact your auto lender and your auto insurance carrier for hardship programs and eligibility requirements.  It may be tempting to let your car insurance go. But if you can, pay your auto insurance bill. A few hundred dollars for auto insurance is a lot less than the several thousands of dollars you may have to pay if you are involved in a car accident.   Student Loan Assistance  If you are unable to make your federal student loan payment, go to the  Federal Student Aid website  to view your options. Contact your student loan provider as soon as possible to discuss your options and get help. If you are unsure of who your loan provider is, you can find them on  this website .  On March 13, President Trump announced that interest on most federal loans would be waived until further notice. Contact your student loan provider for more information.  Internet Assistance  It seems like those of us with kids have become instant homeschool parents! That makes internet access even more important. Several internet providers pledged with the FCC to provide relief due to hardships caused by COVID-19, including not disconnecting services and waiving late fees.  Several internet providers are offering help:  Comcast  is offering free access to Xfinity hotspots for everyone, including non-Xfinity internet subscribers. Charter Communications  is offering free Spectrum Broadband and Wi-Fi internet for the next 60 days. Link on the link above for more details. AT&T  is providing free access to public Wi-Fi Hot spots. Cox  is offering help for lower-income customers and eliminating data usage overages.  As the effects of the COVID-19 continue to impact the country, the list of assistance will expand. Keep reaching out to your creditors and providers for help. Remember, this too shall pass. '\""}
{"text": " I have a truck that I just bought for $35,000. It's now worth about $31,000. Can I trade my truck in for a $20,000 car? What happens with my negative equity on the truck and my sedan that I just paid for with the trade \u2013 in value?  Submitted by Jae E.  It's common to buy a car and want to trade it in the next year for another new or used vehicle. In my own life, upside down car loans have probably cost me thousands of dollars. If you owe more on something than it's worth, in the terminology of the industry, that is known as being upside-down. This applies to roughly half of all new-car buyers, according to Cars.com.  Let's crunch the numbers  You bought a truck for $35,000, but now it is worth $31,000. That's a $4,000 reduction in value. If you financed $35,000 on your vehicle for 60 months with a 4.27% interest rate, your payments are about $648.85/month. Your loan balance after 12 months would be approximately $28,583.69. If your truck has depreciated 25% or about $8750* in year one, the trade value would be about $26,250** even though the book value is $31,000. Unless you sell to an independent buyer, you hardly ever get book value when you trade a car with the dealer.   Based on this scenario, you would be upside-down on your loan about $2,334*** after one year. In this case, your new car purchase price is $20,000, but you owe $28,584. It's only worth $26,250, so you would be paying $20,000 plus the balance of $2,334 or be paying and financing $22,334 under this scenario.  Avoiding Upside-Down Car Loans  To prevent being upside-down car loans again, try to avoid buying new cars unless you have the funds to put at least 20% down. Unfortunately, many people don't understand the complicated financial and behavioral consequences of buying, selling, and trading vehicles. Once you've cleared up your problems with your upside-down car loan, do what you can to keep yourself from ending up in the same situation again.   *Car Loan Amortization Schedule Year 1 Payment: $7,786.20 Principal: $6,416.31 Interest: $1,369.89 Balance: $28,583.69 **Purchase Price ($35,00025%) Depreciation $8750=$26,250 ***Loan Balance after one year = $28,583.69 \u2013 Trade Value $26,250 You owe $2,334 more on the car than it's worth.

{"text": " When applying for a loan, it's helpful to know what your Loan Officer will be looking at when making his or her decision. There are three areas they will review: Capacity, Collateral, and Character.  Capacity  Capacity is simply your ability to repay the loan. They will review your monthly income and expenses to determine if you can afford to make the monthly payments. They will consider open lines of credit as well. If you were to max out all the lines of credit available to you, would you still be able to make the payment or would you be over-extended?  Collateral  Next is collateral. Do you have something of value that you can use as collateral? Essentially you would be saying, \u201cIf I don't pay this loan, you can take this piece of property and sell it to pay off the remaining balance.\u201d For example, for a mortgage loan, your home is the collateral, and for a car loan, your car is the collateral. The lender may determine the amount they are willing to lend you based on what they think the collateral is worth. In other words, you can't borrow $200,000 on a house valued at $75,000.  An un-secured loan is a loan without collateral. The lender is offering the loan strictly on the value of your good name.    Character  Third is character. The lender will review your credit history to see how you've handled debts in the past. Did you pay on time every month and pay the debt in full? Or did you settle any of the debt or declare bankruptcy? These questions aid in revealing how you are likely to handle debt in the future.  Keep these three C's in mind if you plan on doing any borrowing in the future.  You will want to present your best self to your loan officer. '\""}
{"text": " The biggest threat to your finances during a  recession  is a reduction or loss of income. Seemingly disposable income now may be a lifeline to keep you from eviction, foreclosure, or repossession. So if you're doing okay right now, it's a good time to fortify your financial foundation. If anything in your financial picture changes, you'll have a strong enough financial foundation so you don't fall through the floor with a drop income.  Look at your disposable income and see how you can fill in financial gaps that can wreak havoc with your future.  Build Up Your Emergency Savings  The first job of disposable income is to act as a safety net to help you pay for what I call the Quad of Survival. These are essential expenses, such as:  Transportation Housing Healthcare Food  When there is instability, your priority is saving. Your goal should be to save at least three months of expenses to cover the unexpected. If you aren't sure how much you spend in a month, go on your bank's website and review your expenses over the last three months. Divide the total number by three, and use that number as your starting point. You can re-adjust over time. I know this number may seem impossible, but it's not. It's starting small. Even if all you can do is $25 a month, you are now $25 a month closer to your goal. SaverLife has a lot of great  free resources  to help you save.  Rethink Major Purchases  If you're considering buying a home or a car, think about how you can continue to pay your home or car payment if your income is lost or reduced. You may need to postpone or significantly lower your purchase amount to an amount you can afford for a few months if you lost your job or had a reduction in income.  Revisit Your Budget  Your budget is how you've chosen to spend your monthly income. When you face a potential drop in income, carefully review your expenses,  separating your needs from your wants . I found it wasn't the significant $1,000 expenses that hurt someone financially; it was the $1, $5, and $10 purchases that slowly dug a hole in their finances.  Reduce and Pay Down Debt  If you have money saved and are sticking to a monthly budget, consider using some of your disposable income to  reduce debt . Paying down your debt lowers your expenses, meaning you need less money to cover costs if you experience a drop in income. Please note: If you face a pending layoff or significant income cut, then your #1 goal is to boost your savings, not accelerate your debt payoffs.  ***  Re-imaging your disposable income in a recession comes down to timeless financial principles: saving, budgeting, and paying off debt. The key is consistency. The more you follow sound financial principles, the easier it becomes to deal with the unexpected, and the quicker you can bounce back from financial hardships.  '\""}

{"text": " How do I begin with low risk investments? For example CD's, money market accounts, etc.  Submitted by Deirel M.  First of all, way to go!  Investing  is all about preparing for your future and the fact that you're clear that you want low risk is an appropriate first step.  Are You Ready to Start Investing?  How you begin depends on where you are in your investing journey. How much have you set aside to invest? Have you established an emergency fund to make sure you don't need the money before a CD matures?  Let's talk about certificates of deposit and money market accounts first.   What is a Certificate of Deposit?  Most certificates of deposit (CDs) require a minimum deposit to open. With a CD, you can't add to the balance and you can't change the term. Your rate of return is set for that period regardless of how the market fluctuates. If you withdraw the funds before it reaches maturity, you often pay fees and penalties. CDs have a wide variety of term (30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or even years) and, generally, the longer the term of CD, the better the interest rate.  What is a Money Market Account?  Money market accounts  (MMA) require a larger deposit to open compared a regular savings account and usually have limits on the number of withdrawals you can make in a month. Unlike a regular checking account, a MMA is an interest-earning account.  How to Get Started  So, now you know about the tools. What now?  If you're starting out with no savings at all, one of the first things you can do is have a set dollar amount or percentage of your paycheck direct deposited to a savings account. If you can have it at a bank not connected to your checking account, that's a bonus. Out of sight, out of mind. That can keep you from being tempted to make withdrawals (this is future money, right?). Once you have your desired amount, you can check with where the best rates for CD's and money market accounts with  Bankrate  or check with your bank for their latest promotion.  If you aren't quite ready to plunk down a large sum that you don't touch, you can also explore other low-risk investments like savings bonds and high-yield savings accounts. With these, you can start with as little as $50-$100.  Check out more tips on investing:  Investing 101: Stocks, Bonds, and More When Should I Start Investing? '\""}

In today's world, having a good credit score means greater chances of having access to money (or other services) in less time, with fewer requirements, and at lower interest rates (or cost).

They collect historical information about us from our credit reports, run it through their algorithm \u2014 and wallah! This process results in a final number (credit score) that is compared to see if we are above, at, or below average. Depending on where we fall, we will qualify or not for different loans or services. Financial entities, for example, buy this information from these companies when evaluating the conditions of a loan contract. It is their way of determining the responsibility we assume when managing our debts.  How credit scores are used  Credit scores are primarily used by financial institutions, such as banks and lenders. But in recent years, they're increasingly used for other things. For example, insurance companies use credit scores to calculate the price of our auto or life insurance policies. Landlords use them to make renting decisions. Some employers even look at credit scores when hiring. All of them see the credit score as a way to measure responsibility. You can see from these few examples that credit scores are really important in our society.   How can you influence your credit score?  To answer this, we will take one of the most commonly used scores, the FICO score, and see how it's calculated. Although the exact formula isn't public, the risk experts who put together the FICO score say it's based on:  Payment history (whether we pay in time or not) \u2013 35% The amount owed (how much of our credit lines we are using, hint: the more you use, the worse) \u2013 30% The length of our credit history \u2013 15% The types of credit \u2013 10% Inquiries (how often we apply for credit) \u2013 10%  You can find your FICO credit score at  myfico.com .  In short, we can influence our personal credit score by always paying on time, not using a high percentage of our credit lines, having a long credit history, having a variety of credit, and not applying for credit (or services that require a credit check) often.  However, we cannot do magic.  What do I mean? We can positively affect the factors that influence our credit score over time, but this change doesn't happen instantaneously. Improving your credit is about changing long-term financial behaviors. And changing behaviors of any kind can be challenging. That is why things like paying our bills on time are always stressful. It's not complicated; it's about being consistent. '\""}

{"text": " Starting college is an exciting time for parents and students alike. But this excitement often comes with stress and uncertainty about how to pay for school. You may be wondering what options are available for you and your child.  If you want to help your child cover the costs of higher education, you have many different options. It's important to understand your options in order to make an informed decision. There are both federal loan options and private loan options. Understanding these two loan options and how to compare them can help you make good decisions.  Should I get a Parent PLUS Loan?  The federal option available to parents is a Direct PLUS Loan, also called a Parent PLUS Loan. This loan has a fixed interest rate. Just like federal student loans, the servicer for this loan is assigned by the Department of Education. For this loan, the student must be enrolled in school at least half time.    To apply for a Parent PLUS Loan, you complete a separate application in addition to FAFSA each year. This application considers your credit and also ensures that you and your child meet the eligibility requirements for federal student aid. These requirements include US citizenship or eligible non-citizenship, financial need. Also the student must be enrolled in an eligible degree or certificate program at the institution they attend. If you qualify, you can borrow enough money to cover the difference between your child's financial aid and the cost of attendance.    One benefit to the Parent PLUS Loan is that you can defer payments while your child is in school. If you don't elect to do this, your payments will begin once the loan has been fully disbursed to the school. There are three repayment options for the Parent PLUS Loan: standard repayment, graduated repayment, and extended repayment. This loan can also be eligible for  Public Service Loan Forgiveness  if you consolidate them into a direct consolidation loan. Eligibility for this program and the different repayment options are based on the parent's occupation.  Parent Plus Loans are in the parent's name. You cannot transfer these loans to the student at any point in time.  Should I get a private loan to help my child pay for college?  In addition to the Parent PLUS Loan, you can also take out private education loans to help your child pay for school. These loans are different than private student loans that you cosign. Instead, these loans are designed for parents and are held solely in their name. Like the Parent PLUS Loan, private education loans for parents consider your creditworthiness. These private loans can have fixed or variable interest rates depending on the borrowing terms. Your credit will determine the interest rate.  Like the Parent PLUS Loan, you can privately borrow the difference between financial assistance and the cost of attendance.  Depending on the lender, you can select full deferment or interest only payments while your child is in school. Once your child graduates or leaves school, there are often different repayment plans that you can choose.  What is the right way for you to support your child?  Both types of parent loans allow you to help pay your child's education expenses. Make sure that you can make the payments and understand the terms of the loans, as you are the ones borrowing the money. It's also important that you are getting the best loan for your situation. Compare interest rates, repayment options, and fees to make an informed decision. '\""}

{"text": " When money is tight and a loved one is sick, how do you decide if you should go to work or stay home to care for them? What if you are the one who is ill, and you need time to take care of yourself? Who is going to earn money to pay the everyday living expenses? No one ever wants to be in this position, but this is a real problem faced by Americans every day. That is why some states are beginning to offer paid family leave programs.  Who is Eligible for Paid Family Leave?  The United States does not have a nationwide paid family and medical leave policy.  There are, however, a few states that have adopted laws that allow employees to take a leave of absence with pay in order to care for their own health or that of an ailing loved one. These states are California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Washington, and Washington, D.C.   Each State Has a Different Paid Family Leave Mandate  Each of these states have their own mandate. There isn't a specific set of requirements that is followed by all of them. There are, however, some common components in most of them. These include:  The program is overseen by the State Funded partially by the employees Provide partial pay replacement for qualified leave Included leave reasons are similar to the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Require leave to run concurrently with FMLA (when both apply) Determine employee eligibility by work location, not home of residence.  Require documentation  Where to Find Specifics for Each State  Each state posts its annual contribution rates, taxable wage base, and maximum weekly benefit amounts. The National Partnership for Women and Families has a listing of each state and its specific requirements and conditions for receiving the paid family leave coverage.  This document  will cover information like what situations make you eligible for paid leave and the definition of a family member. It also covers the maximum length of paid leave, employee eligibility requirements, and how the insurance system is funded.    If you are lucky enough to live in a state that offers this assistance, and you find yourself in the unfortunate situation of having to leave your job to care for yourself or a loved one who is ill, this program may help you through this difficult time. Contact your HR Department for guidance through your state's program. '\""}
{"text": "Whether it's something you need or something you want, creating a budget can help you keep your spending in line so you can reach your financial goals.  Creating a budget may seem daunting, but this video walks you through setting up a budget that you can actually stick to. Once you know what your goal is, creating a budget to achieve that goal comes down to six steps:   Know your income : Make sure you're using your net income (how much money you bring home),  not  your salary. Taxes, insurance, and 401k contributions may all cut into your income before you actually see that money.  Determine your fixed expenses : These are expenses that don't change much throughout the year, like rent or mortgage, car payments, insurance, and student loans.  Determine your variable expenses : This includes expenses that change based on how much you use them, like your phone bill, groceries, clothes, and entertainment. You have a lot of control over these expenses.  Prioritize : Determine what's really important to you. What do you feel is truly necessary in your life? Take an honest look at what you truly need, and what you just want. You may find that it's worth it to you to sacrifice some of your variable expenses in order to reach other financial goals.  Follow your spending and review monthly : Hold yourself accountable by following your spending every month. It's easy for small expenses to start adding up!  Keep track : Find a way that works for you to track your spending. There are lots of options out there, from old-fashioned pen and paper to an online app.   As the video explains, budgeting is doable; you just need to commit to being disciplined, planning your expenses, and prioritizing them thoughtfully.

{"text": " Amidst all the turmoil of the last month, the second stimulus bill passed, and payments were issued. By now, you should have received your payment of up to $600 per child and adult in your family \u2014  assuming you are eligible .  It's critical to know your rights with the stimulus payments. Take the time to scan this post for any areas that may apply to you. We will cover all your burning questions about how the stimulus payments affect your taxes, whether they can be garnished, how they impact child support (and vice versa), and what to do if you suspect the IRS made a mistake.  First, have you received your payment?  If you haven't seen your stimulus payment arrive yet, make sure you're looking everywhere it may show up:  Direct deposit in your bank account A check in the mail EIP (debit card) payment, also by mail  In some cases, you'll have to claim the money on your tax return in order to receive your stimulus payment. It's helpful to  know the nuances . You can track the status of your stimulus payment online via the  IRS Get My Payment tool.    Know how taxes will impact your stimulus payment  Stimulus checks are not considered taxable income. For this reason,  you do not have to pay taxes on either stimulus check .  If you did not receive the stimulus, you may still be eligible for the  Recovery Rebate Credit  when you file your taxes. Stimulus payments are based on your 2019 income. That means that if you met certain conditions in 2020, it could change your status and make you eligible:  A loss of income You were newly independent Additional dependents  In these cases, you might receive additional money when you file your 2020 tax return.  Tip : For more information on how to file a tax return to receive stimulus funds you are due, read  Resources to Help You File Your Taxes for Free and Maximize Your Tax Refund .  What to know about debt collection  Stimulus money is yours. Don't give it away to a scam or a debt collector who is pressuring you to pass the cash along. Here's what you need to know about debt collection when it comes to your stimulus payment.  Private debt collectors, including student loan servicers and landlords, cannot withhold or claim funds from your stimulus payment.  Similarly, if you owe the state or government money for any reason, it cannot be garnished from your stimulus payment. (Read more about this  straight from the IRS .) However, note that these funds can be withheld from your potential tax credit, once you file your taxes.  Banks also have the right to use deposited stimulus funds to cover overdraft fees  \u2014 although not all banks are choosing to do so. If this happens to you, contact your bank and request a temporary waiver; they don't have to grant it, but they may.  It's still a smart financial practice to be aware of any judgments against you. Here is how to check:  Download your credit report Check to see if you have a federal tax lien by calling the IRS: 1-800-913-6050 (or ask your tax preparer to call on your behalf) Check with your state tax board or county recorder about other potential liens   While it may be extra challenging right now, paying your bills and taxes on time, to the best of your ability, will help prevent future liens.  How child support impacts your stimulus payment  When the first round of stimulus checks was released, the IRS sent \u201ccatchup payments\u201d to any spouse who had filed for past-due child support, deducting that amount from the stimulus payments of the spouse who owed. This policy has changed for the second stimulus payment. Your past-due child support cannot be garnished (deducted) from your second stimulus check.   What to do if you suspect the IRS made a mistake  Sometimes, the IRS makes mistakes. Recently, the IRS  goofed on the stimulus payments  of millions of Americans who used tax preparers such as Turbo Tax, Jackson Hewitt, and H&R Block. This massive error left a lot of people wondering where their stimulus payments were. On January 10th, the IRS said that it is reissuing some payments that were sent to the wrong bank accounts.  This is a good reminder that it's smart to regularly monitor your bank account for deposits and other activity.  Tip : As an alternative to IRS tools, there are plenty of calculators available to determine whether you should have received a stimulus payment, and for how much, including  this one .  It's important to note that it's also possible for the IRS to mistakenly make a payment to someone who is not actually eligible. It happened in the first round of stimulus payments, and it probably happened in the second round as well. Read more about the circumstances where you might need to  return your stimulus payment .   Protect your stimulus check  Stimulus payments are designed to help Americans with basic bills during a challenging time \u2014 putting food on the table or a roof over your head. It's a good idea to prioritize that money for immediate necessities such as food, rent, mortgage, and utilities. If you do have debt, try to work out a payment plan with your creditors.

Watch out for tax preparers who:   Promise very large tax refunds  Ask you to sign a blank return  Tell you how much of a refund you'll get before looking at your records  Charge fees based on a percentage of the refund   Filing taxes can be stressful, so make sure your preparer is truly on your side and is not taking risks with your financial future.

{"text": " Improving your credit score won't happen overnight, but you can make a difference over time by taking certain actions.  Step 1: Check for Errors  To start with, pull your credit report from from all three credit bureaus using  AnnualCreditReport.com . Normally, you get to do this once a year for free, but because of the pandemic, you can do it once a week for free! Review each item on all reports to make sure they're complete and accurate. If you find any errors, you have the right to  dispute them directly  with the credit bureau. The bureau must research the matter and get back to you with an answer in 60 days. If the information is correct according to the bureau, they will leave it on your report.  What most people don't know is that you have the right to put a 100-word explanation on your report. If you believe the report is incorrect, you can explain your side of the story. It won't change your credit score, but it may make a difference to the person who is reviewing your credit bureau when you apply for your next loan.  Step 2: Pay Your Bills on Time  The most powerful way to improve your credit score is to pay every bill on time every month, month after month. Your payment history makes up 35% of your credit score. There is no way to go back and change history, but moving forward, pay on time. This will eventually improve your score, but it will take time.  Step 3: Pay Down Your Credit Card Balance  The next area that makes up 30% of your credit score is the balance that is carry on each of your credit cards. Did you know that if the balance you owe is more than one third of the credit limit, this hurts your credit score?For instance, if you have a credit card with a $3,000 limit, try not to use more than $1,000. Once the balance owed goes over $1,000, it starts to lower your credit score. If you have cards with high balances, review your budget and find some extra money to pay down these cards. The faster you get those balances down, the faster your credit score will go up.  Step 4: It Takes Time!  There are three other areas that make up the rest of your credit score: credit mix (10%), length of credit history (15%), and new credit (10%). You want to have a mix of credit accounts such as a mortgage, credit cards, and a car loan. Have you had credit for years or are you new to having credit? And lastly, if you have many new inquiries on your credit in a short amount of time, that will lower your credit score.   '\""}

{"text": " That is a hard question, which I can only answer with a lot more questions!  Question 1: Timeline  The first question you need to ask yourself is: when do you want to retire? This will help you figure out how much time you have to get where you want to be.  Question 2: Expenses  Second, what will your living expenses be when you retire? Will you be in a high cost of living area? Do you expect you will have paid off your home already? Or will you have a mortgage or rent payment? Figure out the same for your car. And don't forget food, utilities, gas and car insurance, along with medical insurance and medical bills.  Question 3: Retirement Goals  Next, what are your retirement goals? What is it that you want to do in retirement? Do you see a life of travel or do you want to stay home? Will you want to do some upgrading to your home or start that business that you always wanted to start? You need to factor in all of these expenses in addition to your normal, day-to-day expenses.   Question 4: Income  Determine what you can expect your Social Security income to be. You can do that by going to the  Social Security Administration website  and registering with MySocialSecurity. This will allow you access projections from the Social Security Administration.  Also, will you have a pension from a former employer or are you building your own savings in a 401(k) or IRA, or both? This is where your savings should be. If you haven't started yet, the sooner you start saving the better.  Your time is worth more than your money  when it comes to retirement savings.   Next Steps for Retirement Planning  This can all be a little (or a lot!) overwhelming. There are experts who can help you run the math on all of this, and they can make projections on the earnings of your savings. This is where time comes into play. The more time you have to save, the harder your money can move you toward your retirement goals.  If it's within your financial limits, I would recommend a Certified Financial Planner who is Fee Only. They have software that can calculate what you will need in order to get the retirement you want. Certified Financial Planners can be expensive, so shop around and also check with your HR Dept.

{"text": " Every 5-10 years, we face a major crisis. Today it's the Coronavirus, a decade ago it was the housing bubble burst, before that September 11, and before that the dot.com bust. My point is that a crisis will come and go, but the sound financial principles needed to weather the storms of a crisis never change.  How to handle a drop in income  Any time you face a possible drop in income, the best defense is a good offense:     Contact your creditors. Let them know you may have a drop in income and may not be able to pay your bill. Creditors are far more likely to work with you if you proactively call them before you miss a payment. Temporarily stop any excess payments to debts. Continue to pay the debt minimums and start saving to cover living and unexpected expenses. When the crisis passes, you have a chunk of cash to throw at your debts. Review your spending for expenses to reduce. For most people, groceries (doing more coupons, meal planning, etc.), eating out, entertainment and travel are the quickest expenses to cut.  Postpone major expenses or upgrades until you can gauge the long-term impact of the crisis to your finances.  How to respond to the changing stock market  If you are watching your 401k plan turn into a 201k plan, your first reaction may be to sell. I encourage you to think twice. The last 10 unusual years of market highs have made people forget that highs and lows in the stock market are normal. The last thing you want to do is make a short-term decision based on panic that will cost you long-term market gains.  Don't believe me. Ask anyone who took their money out of the stock market 10 years ago. The Dow is a widely followed method of measuring the stock market. About 10 years ago, the Dow averaged about 10,600 points in 2010 and the Dow more than doubled in the last ten years (Dow hit a market high of 29,551 points in Feb 2020). I don't know about all of you, but it would hurt to know because of a moment of panic I missed my investments doubling in the future.  Your investment decisions should be based on:  How long before you need the money? A rule of thumb is that funds needed in five years or less should not be invested in the stock market. How much highs and lows in the market are can you handle? Remember, you have to be okay with your investments, whether the market is up or down. How much time do you want to spend researching and reviewing your investments? The best investment method is often the simplest.  None of the questions above have to do with temporary market conditions. Emotions can make an irrational decision seem logical.  It is tough watching what seems like the world falling apart around you. We are resilient and we will persevere.   '\""}
{"text": " The standard deduction is the amount of income you get to deduct from your total taxable income. Because the standard deduction lowers your taxable income, it means you pay less income tax.   In 2019, the standard deduction for someone filing as single is $12,200. For a Head of Household, the standard deduction is $18,350. And for married couples, the standard deduction is $24,400.  For example, let's say you are single, and in 2019 your total taxable, earned income was $48,000. That is the amount your employer will report to the IRS.   When you file your taxes, you report the same amount, but then you get to deduct $12,200 from the $48,000. Now the amount you pay taxes on is $35,800. You would go to the IRS tax table for the year 2019 (this table is currently still a draft on the IRS website) and it will tell you that in 2019, the total tax due on $35,800 (your new taxable income amount) is $4,129.00. If you didn't have the standard deduction, the total tax due on $48,000 would have been $6,424.    Because of the standard deduction, your tax liability decreased by $2,295.

You may also qualify for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) to help cover the cost of feeding yourself and your family. SNAP is a federal program that provides nutrition benefits to low-income families to help them purchase food. If your income has declined, SNAP benefits may help you through this uncertain time.  How do you apply for SNAP benefits?  SNAP is a federal program, but it's administered at the state or county level. You need to apply in the state where you live. Some states have re-named the program: for example, CalFresh in California or Basic Food in Washington. You can find  information for each state's program .  In response to the COVID-19 crisis, many states have:  Made it easier for people to apply for benefits  Extended the certification periods for re-affirming eligibility  Temporarily increased benefit levels up to the maximum allotment based on family size  Additionally, the federal government suspended the three-month time limit on receiving SNAP benefits for unemployed adults without dependent children.   What information do you need to apply for SNAP benefits?  There are a few important things to know about the application for SNAP benefits. The application will ask you to define your household side. For this program, your household is as all the people who live with you and prepare food with you. If you have a roommate, but you shop and cook separately, you are a single-person household.  In most states, you'll need to follow up your SNAP application by providing supporting documentation of your:  identity residence immigration and citizenship status income expenses  Income and asset limits for SNAP benefits  The application will ask for both your gross monthly income and your net monthly income. In most cases, you  have to meet both requirements to qualify. SNAP counts income from all sources, including earnings, unemployment insurance, cash benefits, and child support.  Currently for a one-person household gross monthly income is limited to $1,354 and net monthly income is limited to $1,041. For a family of four these are raised to a gross monthly income of $2,790 and $2,146 net monthly income. (Please note that these amounts are higher in Alaska and Hawaii.)  If your household income is under the gross monthly income limit, you should apply. As you apply, you'll figure out your net income, which factors in deductions and taxes. This is important because it allows you to subtract out a portion of your biggest expenses like the housing, utilities, and medical costs. Medical expenses for the SNAP program are broad. They include any costs for prescriptions, medical equipment, doctor's visits, and dental appointments not covered by other programs. These costs are excluded because paying these necessary expenses leaves less money in the budget for food.   In some states, the application also asks about assets. You can exclude your house and your first car. The program may request information on any other cars and other assets you may own, like savings accounts.  Receiving and using SNAP benefits  After you submit an application and are deemed eligible for benefits, you'll receive an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card. The dollar value of your benefits are automatically added to your account each month. The EBT card works just like a debit card, but with limitations on its use. You can use it to purchase groceries at any authorized store or retailer (in some places, this includes farmers markets).  You can use your EBT card to buy:  fruits and vegetables meat, poultry, and fish dairy products breads, cereals, and other snack foods non-alcoholic beverages seeds and plants that could produce food for the household  You're not able to use your benefits to buy:  alcohol of any kind tobacco products vitamins, medicines, and supplements live animals prepared foods (that you could immediately consume) or hot foods any non-food items  When you receive your benefits, you will also receive notification that lets you know how long you will receive benefits. This is your certification period. Prior to the end of your certification period, you will be notified to re-certify so that you can continue receiving benefits. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, many states have extended certification periods.   '\""}

{"text": "What's holding me back from getting approved for a credit card?  Submitted by anonymous.  There are  many reasons  that credit card companies deny an application for a credit card. They review your application and your credit history to assess if you have stable income and how likely you are to pay them back (on time). You may be denied if your credit reports show limited or negative history, or if you have too many open accounts.  If you have been denied, you have the right to review the report they used to make their decision. This is a great time to review your credit report so you know exactly what potential creditors see. Keep in mind that each time you submit a credit application, you get an \u201cinquiry\u201d on your report. Inquiries can actually can make your credit score go down.

{"text": "\u201cMy son is 7 and my daughter is 4. Is it too late to invest in 529 plan for them? What would be a better alternative to save for their college and financial future?\u201d  Submitted by Stella D.  It is never too early or too late to start saving for college (or for anything, for that matter). Here are a few things to keep in mind:  What's the Big Picture?  Plan your savings with your  entire  financial life in mind. For instance, if you have high-interest debt, create a repayment plan that reduces or eliminates that before you go all-in on saving for college. This is a common dilemma because most of us have multiple financial goals and we want to accomplish them all. Minimizing or eliminating debt will free up more cash to save and will reduce the interest you pay.  With that out of the way, there are a few options to save for college.  Benefits of a 529 Account  A  529 account  is a tax-advantaged savings plan that has many different uses for college or education funding. The tax advantage is that you don't pay taxes on the investment gains if you use the funds for qualified education expenses.  529 accounts are popular because family members and friends can contribute on birthdays and other occasions. While this may not be exciting to your children when they are young, it will certainly put a smile on their faces when they are off to college.  Most often, the asset allocation (picture a pie chart of different types of investments) begins to lean toward a more conservative approach as your children get older.  Because you are starting later, you may need to be more aggressive with your saving amount to reach your target. Figure out that amount using this  college savings calculator .  Other Options  Other than a 529 account, here are some of your options:   Pre-paid tuition if you know where your child will attend school.  UTMA/UGMA (UGMA stands for the Uniform Gift to Minors Act. UTMA stands for Uniform Transfer to Minors Act) custodial accounts. The tax breaks may not be as generous and you cannot control how your child spends the money once they reach 18 (or 21 in some states).  If your child is earning income, consider a Roth IRA which can be used for qualified education expenses and can serve as a base investment for their future. It's a good way to start them thinking about saving for retirement while they are young!  Parent retirement accounts  are also an option. Look carefully at all of the impact on your long-term financial preparedness before taking this step.   Building Your Savings Plan  Whew, so many decisions and those little ones grow up so fast. Saving for the future is ALWAYS a good choice and fortunately you have several choices (which is sometimes a challenge, right?). Let me break it down:   How much do you think your child will need? Use that calculator I mentioned above to come up with an estimate.  How much can you afford to save? (Got a budget?)  How many years before your child heads off to college?  Are you likely to need that money for K-12 education?  Is your child likely to be eligible for need-based scholarships?   The  \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d Foundation  provides individualized social, emotional, and academic support to young people from low-income communities from kindergarten all the way through college, along with guaranteed tuition support. This is just one of many programs in the U.S. designed to help families save for college.  As you face all of these facts, keep in mind that even if you are unable to save  all  of the money your child will need to attend college,  research shows that saving a little goes a long way , so choose an approach and then take action.

{"text": " Tax time is an important time for most families. You find out if you're getting a tax refund. And this year, that assistance is more valuable than ever. For all of those who are wondering, the IRS will start sending out tax refunds in early March. If you anticipate that you will receive a refund this year, or you are claiming your Recovery Rebate Credit through your taxes, you may be looking forward to \u2014and need\u2014 those funds.      If you absolutely need your tax refund before the IRS can send it to you, here is a quick guide to all that you need to know about a product you may have heard about: the Refund Advance loan. A Refund Advance loan is debt. It is a loan against the tax refund you are expecting to receive. It is usually between $200 and $4,000. Sometimes, you can get the loan within 24 hours.   You may find yourself in the position where getting money sooner rather than later can make a big difference. For this question, I am setting aside my tax professional hat and putting on my Accredited Financial Counselor\u00ae hat. As a financial counselor, I would prefer that you not pay unnecessary fees and charges or to place yourself at risk of having unexpected debt. But I also know that life happens. I suggest asking yourself three questions before rushing to any lender for fast cash.  1. Can I Wait? What Are My Other Options?  This year, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IRS has changed some of its filing dates. They started processing returns on February 12. Tax credits and refunds are expected to go out in early March. This means it may be a few weeks before you receive your funds.   If your bills are paid and you don't need that money immediately, then can you wait a few extra weeks? If you are planning to make a big purchase, wouldn't it be better to avoid paying fees and have more money?   2. How Much Does a Refund Anticipation Loan Cost?  The biggest reason to avoid a Refund Advance loan is the cost: it can be expensive. The fees can vary quite a bit, even those ones that offer a 0% loan.  Some  of these have already closed applications for loans, but for those that are still open, the costs can range from zero to hundreds of dollars in tax preparation fees. Usually, the costs of the loan are built-in to the tax preparer's fee, or the tax preparer may sell additional services to you to pay for the loan. Here is an example: a taxpayer takes out a $500 tax refund loan, and pays a $59 tax preparation fee. This amounts to an APR of 142%.   It's a good idea to ask yourself if you have other things to spend this money on that would be better for you. Is the charge really worth getting your money faster? Most Americans can  file their taxes for free , and don't need to pay the tax preparation fee that is bundled with the loan.  3. Can I Accept the Risk and Do I Understand the Terms?  This is the part that often gets ignored. I have shown my clients Refund Anticipation loans in the past. And I'll tell you, it is rare for someone to actually read the terms and conditions. Typically, they glance and sign. Sometimes not even glance! What you need to be aware of is what happens if your refund is delayed. What happens if the IRS requests additional information before processing your return? Will that increase your costs with additional fees and charges? What happens if the IRS doesn't give you a refund or gives you a smaller refund than you filed for? Will you get more charges? Will that negatively impact your credit if it happens? I ask these questions because these things all happen. Make sure these risks are worth taking before agreeing to a refund advance.  It's also important to know more about the lender. In general, borrowing directly from banks is safer and cheaper, because banks are regulated by the government.    This tax year is different from previous years. This year, many households have received unemployment insurance, and this is taxable. (Stimulus checks are not.) If you believe you will owe taxes on any unemployment insurance you received, that can reduce your refund, which can impact the amount that you'll have to pay back on any Refund Anticipation loan that you take.   ***  If you don't truly need the money right away, I encourage you to avoid a refund advance. You can put the money that would have gone to more fees toward paying off debt, toward your kids, or whatever is important to you. '\""}
{"text": "What Do You Believe?  Everything you DO with money makes perfect sense if you know what you BELIEVE about money. If you believe that money is a necessary evil, you may resist saving. If you believe there will never be enough money, you may be reluctant to spend it. Our money fears and fantasies set the stage for how we behave and our ability to use money to get the life we want.  Be Present with Your Money  Being present with your money is the practice of money mindfulness. This really isn't about  doing  anything differently, but simply noticing what you do and how you feel about the choices you make. You can do this in a journal, on index cards, or on the back of your spending tracker.  (Still haven't started tracking your spending? Check out our  tips for tracking your spending habits .)  Here are a few things to think about:   How do you define financial success?  What will your life look like when you have achieved financial success?  How will the people you care about be affected when you achieve it?  What is one thing you can do this week to move in that direction?

{"text": "If you review your spending over the last month, you can almost certainly find one regular expense you can reduce. Then you can put the money toward savings instead. Grab a snack, put on some good music, and get your bank and credit card statements from last month (go ahead, we'll wait)\u2026  Okay, scan through the statements and categorize the things you spend money on each month. Start with broad categories like \u201cliving expenses\u201d (what you must pay) and \u201clifestyle expenses\u201d (what you spend to enjoy life more). Once you do that, focus on a monthly expense that you want to tackle. It doesn't matter which category. Just pick something that you will reduce consistently.  Now you've chosen a category to reduce, it's time to brainstorm. Think about what changes you want to make. For instance, if you want to reduce your restaurant spending, first think about what is important to you about eating out. Is it the meal itself, or is there more to it? When you eat out, are you alone or with other people? If you reduced this expense, how would you get that need met? Having a plan for the change you want to make will help you be more consistent.  There are only three things you can do if you want to change your financial life: make more, spend less, or a combination of the two. Remember, there's no judgment. Just align your spending with what matters most.  Will you pledge to do a one-month savings bump based on your scavenger hunt? '\""}
{"text": "Even if you are doing all you can to manage your money, we know there are some circumstances where your bank, job, or landlord may be taking advantage of you. These situations can be financial land mines, so it's crucial to know your rights and get help if you need it.  Let's take a look at some common abusive practices that can hinder your best efforts to achieve financial security.  1. Where You Bank  We don't have to look very far to see abusive practices in our financial systems. Payday lenders, for example, charge outrageous interest rates that create cycles of financial destruction. These practices are unfortunately quite common, but we only hear about the abusive practices of more mainstream financial institutions when there is a big incident affecting lots of people.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has an extensive database of complaints that you can check.

{"text": " The COVID-19 stimulus checks are starting to arrive in bank accounts and mailboxes. If you're getting one, you may be wondering what to do with this money. First, I will say that the government is issuing this money to families to help with basic living essentials. We don't know how long our nation will be sheltering in place, nor do we know how long it will take our country and businesses to recover.   If you are still able to work and you haven't lost your income, you have more options as to what you do with the money. If you have been laid off or your income has been reduced, your options may be limited. Consider your financial situation and the needs of your family when deciding what to do with you COVID-19 stimulus check.  Below are five things to do with your COVID-19 Stimulus Check:  Meet basic needs  Use the money to supplement your reduced income. Since we don't know how long this pandemic and its effects will last, I would try to stretch the money out for 3-6 months. It may not be a lot, but it can make things a little more bearable.  Save it  If you don't need to supplement your income, add to your emergency fund (a little light humor \u2013 wait, this is an emergency!).  Continue to build your savings, as we are seeing, life is so uncertain.  Pay down debt  With your basic needs being met, and you're putting money in your savings, the next thing you can do is tackle your debt.  If you're able, pay a credit card off, reduce your balance to 30% or less, of your credit limit.  If you have any loans, see if you can pay a little extra toward the principle.  Whatever you can do to reduce your overall debt helpful \u2013 every little bit helps.  Start investing in your financial future  There are several online platforms that will allow you to get started with very little money.  This is an opportunity to get your feet wet, and learn.  These platforms are good for beginning investors, and a way to build your confidence and comfort level.  Taking these small investing steps are steps to securing your financial future.  Invest in yourself  This may be a good time to learn a new skill; take an online course that may increase your marketability, position you to get a better job, or allow you to start a side hustle of your own.  Choose something that will enrich your life, and will add value.  The COVID-19 stimulus checks may not be a lot, but it is a small windfall for many.  You should be strategic in planning how you will use the money.  Allow this money to lighten your financial burden, and start you on a trajectory to a better financial life.  Make it count. '\""}

{"text": " We know that many of you have burning questions about unemployment benefits, including how they affect taxes and how they relate to the  American Rescue Plan . Here are answers to some of the questions you've asked.   What Does the American Rescue Plan Do for Me if I'm Unemployed?   If you lost your job during the pandemic, the American Rescue Plan extends certain pandemic-related programs through September 6, 2021. Here are some of the ways that you could benefit.    Federal unemployment benefits (FPUC), at $300 per week, on top of state benefits. If you have exhausted state unemployment benefits, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) will be extended to 53 weeks. These are for the \u201clong-term unemployed\u201d who were initially eligible for state benefits but exhausted them before finding employment.  If you are typically ineligible for state unemployment benefits, the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program will be extended to 79 weeks (up to 86 weeks in some states). You may be eligible for PUA if you lost work for specific COVID-related reasons but are ineligible for normal state benefits. This includes self-employed people and gig workers. If you earned both self-employment income and other wages, you might be eligible for an additional $100 per week from the Mixed Earners Unemployment Compensation (MEUC) program.  For more details about all of these programs, check out this  guide  from The Century Foundation.   I Heard There's a $10,200 Tax Break for Unemployment Payments. What Does That Mean, and Should I File an Amended Return?  If you received unemployment income in 2020, the first $10,200  will not be taxable . After that amount, unemployment is considered taxable income. For married couples who file jointly, the first $20,400 of unemployment income received in 2020 is non-taxable.   Tip : Find out more about  who qualifies for this tax break .   Note that this only applies to federal taxes. States have their own rules around tax breaks. You'll need to ask a tax preparer for help or look into your state's rules around tax breaks and unemployment income.  If you've already filed your taxes for 2020, you don't need to file an amended return just yet. Wait for more information from the IRS.  I Think I Already Paid Taxes on My Unemployment Payments. Did I?  It's entirely possible. States are required to offer you the option to withhold taxes from your check, just as an employer would. If you chose to do so, you should have had 10% withheld from each payment.   If you did not choose to have taxes withheld and would like to start, you can do so  at the IRS site . A tax preparer can also help you determine if you overpaid these taxes and how to claim a refund.   What Should I Do Now?   The most important thing to know is that you should file your taxes. The national tax deadline was recently extended to May 17, which gives you an extra month \u2014 and for  Texas and Oklahoma residents , the deadline is pushed back to June 15.  When you file your taxes, you'll need to fill out the section on unemployment benefits and use Form 1099-G. Whichever state agency paid your unemployment benefits should issue you a 1099-G form for any payments you received in 2020. On the form, Box 1 is for how much you received, and Box 4 is for how much tax was taken out of those payments if any.  Do I Have to Pay State Taxes on Unemployment?  It depends on which state you live in. In some states, unemployment benefits are tax-exempt. Check with your state tax agency or your tax preparer for more information.   Are Stimulus Checks Taxable?  You don't have to pay taxes on your stimulus check!

Many of us don't want to be working in software, hoping that the right questions are asked and that you provide the right answers. This is where VITA may provide a good option for you.  Who Is Eligible for Tax Help from VITA or TCE?  The IRS's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program has been around for over 50 years. Typically, it offers free tax help and tax filing assistance to:  People who generally make about $57,000 a year or less Persons with disabilities Military service members and families Limited English-speaking taxpayers  Also, the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) program specializes in assisting those who are 60 years of age or older.  The sites for these programs are staffed with IRS-certified volunteers and are often part of non-profit organization. All the volunteers who prepare tax returns must have training that meets or exceeds IRS standards. Some sites have restrictions on whom they will assist and on what level of complexity they will handle. And others may help people with higher income than indicated above. It is a good idea to make sure ahead of time that they can assist you for your particular tax situation.  I have seen non-profits that are focused on one segment of our society offer VITA services to people in other segments. If an organization may be more convenient for you and you aren't sure they will help you, ask them.   How to Find a VITA Site  You could use favorite search engine to find a VITA site or call around to non-profits to track one down. But I prefer to use the IRS website \u2013 after all, they are paid by our tax dollars! The IRS has a  VITA/TCE Locator Tool . In addition to the location, you can find what days of the year they operate (some are open outside of \u201ctax season\u201d), hours of operation, whether services can be provided using languages other than English, contact information, and whether an appointment is required.   Note that some VITA sites assist you in doing the tax returns. Others do the returns for you much like when a tax professional does your tax return. If you prefer one approach versus the other, make sure you ask before you go.  VITA is a good option if you want in-person assistance, if you meet the requirements of the VITA site for assistance, and your tax return isn't too complicated. Tax prep fees can easily cost several hundred dollars. If VITA fits your situation, you can keep those dollars. My guess is you can find some good uses for that money.

{"text": " I have a HSA through my company. I don't like their services and investing options. Can I transfer some of the funds I have to a new account at another financial institution?  Submitted by Sudawan K.  Take a moment and pat yourself on the back for planning ahead for your medical expenses. Not everyone does, so I want to acknowledge that you are doing it. Congratulations! I was talking about your question with my #MoneyBuddy  Brandy Baxter , and being the money nerd she is, she got all excited and started rattling off ideas. So here we go!  Tax Benefits of an HSA  First, the money you contribute to your HSA is a tax-planning power play. You contribute money with pre-tax dollars, which lowers your tax liability. Plus, the money earns interest tax-free, and is tax-free when you use it for qualifying medical expenses. This is a great benefit if you or your family  tend to have lots of medical expenses not covered by insurance. Another benefit is the balance of your account rolls over year after year, so you don't lose any of the money you're saving.  Finding a New Bank  My first question for you: have you found another bank that has better investment options? If you haven't, that's okay. But be sure to do that before making any moves. When you decide to move your funds to another account, they can easily be transferred to another bank as long as the new bank also offers HSA accounts.  Funds Rollover Versus Trustee to Trustee Transfer  This next point is important, so take notes. There are two types of transfers you can do with your HSA: a funds rollover and a trustee to trustee transfer.  We went straight to the  IRS website  to get the lowdown on this topic. A funds rollover occurs when your current HSA account holder sends you a check and you deposit the amount into your new account. Failure to make the deposit into a qualifying HSA account within 60 days of receiving the check will result in a penalty. Yikes! Please don't make this mistake.  A trustee to trustee transfer is when you authorize your HSA provider to transfer the funds directly to your new HSA provider. This is important, because the money never comes to you in this type of transaction. This means no penalties (or the danger of missing a deadline). Simply ask your new provider to give you a trustee to trustee form. After completing, you're all set and on your way to earn more money on your investment! '\""}
{"text": " As a financial coach, I encourage parents to talk to their children about college as early as possible. Nowadays, college is one of the most expensive costs, next to a car or a home. Enrolling, paying, and attending college is also a complicated process.  Leaving this in the hands of an 18-year-old is unfair. Your child has no idea the true cost of anything, let alone college. They have no idea the mental and financial havoc a huge student loan debt will do to their futures. As parents, I urge you to step in and have enough courage to be willing to say no to an expensive school, so your kids can say yes to a future without huge student debt.  How to Start the Conversation  Let your kids know:  You want to be part of the decision. You'll work with them so they don't make a decision they will regret. You love them enough to say no to a college that will saddle them with debt they'll be paying off when your future grandchild goes to college.  Important Questions to Discuss with Your Kids  Discuss whether they even want to go to college. If they're hesitant, consider a local community college or trade school.  Be honest with your kids about how much you can financially support them. There is no shame in saying you cannot pay for college. The earlier they know, the longer you and your child have to research scholarships, grants, and other options to pay for college.  Encourage your kids to get jobs that pay for colleges like the military, Peace Corps, or even companies like Starbucks. Show your kids the  cost of their education choices . If they want to go to an expensive private school, show them how much debt they will have along with their  average starting salary . It doesn't take a lot of math to figure out a $150,000 loan for a degree with an average career salary of $40,000 may not make sense. As their parent, you have to step in to protect their future. Use an  Expected Family Contribution Calculator  to estimate how much you may have to pay for college.   Research Other Resources for Paying for College  Next, talk with your kid's school counselor about ways to pay for their college expenses.  Ask the counselor about tutoring programs to boost their college entrance exam scores. A high SAT or ACT score can equal scholarships, free tuition, or reduced tuition.  Find out how early your can start taking college entrance exams. Encourage your child to focus on their talents, whether athletic or academic. Work with your school counselor to research and apply for scholarships.   Talk to your child and their school counselor about your child either attending a local college and living at home or attending a local college for the first two years and then transferring to a 4-year college.  The kindest thing you can do for your child is to be honest about how much you can afford to help them pay for college. They will survive not going to their first college choice. They will survive living at home while they go to college. But they may struggle for 20 years to pay off $100,000 in student loan debt. Taking the time to engage with your kids about college will help protect their financial futures. '\""}
{"text": "    As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, you may have to stretch a lower income to cover regular expenses. If your income has been reduced or you have had a lot of unexpected expenses, having enough money to feed yourself and your family may be a challenge. Food is a necessity to maintain a healthy life. But other expenses may become a priority, which reduces the amount of money you can spend on groceries.  1. Eat Healthy, Hearty Foods  We need to eat regularly, not just so we don't feel hungry, but also to help us think clearly to do daily work, to stay healthy to avoid illness, and so children can learn and grow. Food that is high in protein (meats and dairy), carbohydrates (rice, pasta, and bread), and fats (whole milk and cheese) are going to fill you up and keep you going. These are better choices than fast food, chips, crackers, soda, and sweets.  2. Plan Ahead and Cook Simple Meals  When you need to stretch your food dollars, plan simple meals with few ingredients. It isn't about how many different foods you have for a meal, but about the amount of food needed to feed your household. Now may not be the time to get creative. Regularly take an inventory of the food in the cupboard so you can plan to use the ingredients that you have. Also, use fresh produce soon after purchasing so it doesn't spoil. Consider buying in bulk. You can purchase grain products such as rice, pasta, and cereals in larger quantities, so that they cost less per serving. Shop sales and, if possible, buy extra of the sale items that you regularly use. Look for  coupons  for foods you regularly buy. This takes a little extra time but can pay off with great savings.  3. Find Resources to Help  In addition to making good use of the foods you purchase, consider checking your local community for food assistance programs. There are many programs from non-profit organizations that help local residents meet their food needs.  Feeding America  is a national program that helps connect people with local food banks. When you visit the website you can search for food programs in your community.  Full Cart  is a virtual emergency food assistance center that delivers food to you. You can find an application for the program on the website. Your community may also have emergency food programs or free meal programs that are organized by faith-based organizations.   A financial shortfall could be a short or long term situation. Staying healthy is important for your well-being. Review how you manage and prepare meals and look for additional resources that will help you during this time.  '\""}
{"text": " I want to buy a house, but I have bad credit. Should I file bankruptcy? What should I do?  Submitted by Marcella S.  Buying a home is many people's idea of achieving the American Dream. But the road to homeownership can be stressful, confusing, and overwhelming. When I purchased my first home, I had no idea about the home buying process. I experienced all three feelings as I went through the process for the first time. Being prepared to purchase a home is particularly beneficial when buying a house for the first time.   Get Mortgage Ready  You must first become mortgage ready to purchase a home. Three primary steps convey mortgage readiness to a financial institution. One, all lenders review the borrower's credit history and credit scores from all three credit bureaus and choose the middle rating. This is known as a tri-merge. It's a good idea for you to  pull all three credit reports  for free ahead of time. This way you know what aspects of your credit report needs correcting. Second, they analyze your capacity to repay the loan by looking at your debt to income ratio. Third, there is a review of the collateral value (the house) you are buying to determine what it's worth.  Each financial institution sets its criteria for qualified credit history and credit scores, debt ratios, and collateral values. So you may need to shop around with a few lenders before you find one that will work with you.   Options for Low Credit  If you don't have good credit, you may be required to have additional funding and an alternative form of credit like the following:  Larger Down Payment : A down payment reduces the risk for the lender. You have skin in the game. They have a buffer. Cash Reserves : Even with a sizable down payment, it's helpful to have ample cash reserves on hand. Rent History : Be able to verify that you've paid your rent-on time consistently for 12 to 24 months.    Is bankruptcy a good option?  If you file bankruptcy, that will only make your credit worse. So that's probably not a good idea if you want to achieve your objective of purchasing a home in the near future.  I wish you the best in your homeownership pursuit! '\""}
{"text": " \u201cHow can you budget your money when you have the same amount coming in as you did before, but now you have everyone at home using more electricity, gas, and water and eating more food?\u201d  Submitted by Kelly B.  A budget is nothing more than deciding how you will spend money before you get it.  How you spend money will change as your life changes. During COVID-19, that means changing how you spend and your family changing their behavior, especially when using food and utilities.  Keep Your Spending on Food in Check  I've found that it's harder than before to control our food spending. Below are a few suggestions based on what has worked in my house:  Buy Food in Bulk and Bag the Food Yourself  Consider buying food, particularly snack food, in bulk. This may be cheaper than pre-packaged food and you just need to bag the food yourself. We do this with chips and fruit like grapes. Bagging the food myself helps me control how much each person eats and helps the food last longer.   Read more about  strategies to stretch your food dollars .   Stick to a Shopping Schedule  I create a weekly meal plan, including snacks, and I shop only once a week (I have a family of five, with three teens). My family knows that if they eat all of a food before my shopping day, they will have to wait until I shop again to get that item. To save time, shop online at your favorite grocery store and use the free curbside pickup to get your groceries. Curbside pickup saves time and money because I only buy what is on my list.  Create Rules for When and What Your Kids Eat  I found my kids ate out of boredom and thirst. I told my kids they must drink a glass of water and wait 30 minutes after eating before eating again. This rule helped to cut down on \u201cboredom\u201d eating, and our food lasts longer.  I also realized that a box of cereal only lasts a day in my home. My kids were consuming cereal for breakfast, lunch, and as a snack. I put on our refrigerator what my kids can eat for breakfast, lunch, and snacks. Limiting breakfast foods to only breakfast and including fruits or veggies with every meal helped our food last longer and helped my kids eat healthier.  Read more tips about  grocery shopping on a budget during COVID-19 .  Monitor and Limit Your Utility Bills  Like many of you, I nearly passed out when I saw the dramatic increase in our utilities. The following are changes you can make to help lower your utility bills:  Limit Shower Time  We have three teenage daughters who take long showers, so we limited shower time to 10 minutes. We put timers in their bathrooms. By the next month, we saw a difference in our water bill.  Use Fans and Keep the Thermostat Above 70 Degrees  Fans cost less than an HVAC. When our kids complained about being hot, we noticed they were wearing hoodies, and we told them to dress for summer inside the house and turn on a fan.  Contact Your Utility Provider  Ask for discounts and special programs to save money on your utility bills.  Research Utility Companies  In our area, we had multiple choices for providers and found there were cheaper services. Call different utility providers, price shop, and ask for discounts for switching services.  Other Ways of Saving  Look at spending in other areas, and see where you can lower your expense. Ask your cable, internet, phone, and insurance providers for discounts. If you have credit cards, ask for a lower interest rate.  With everything happening today, I understand how life may feel out of control. The key surviving tough season is working as a family to change your spending and your family's habits.

{"text": " To participate in Public Service Loan Forgiveness, make sure that you meet all the requirements. You must have the right type of loans, the correct occupation, a full-time job, and the correct repayment plan. Plus, you need to make eligible payments for ten years. After ten years, if you meet all of these conditions, you are eligible to have the remaining balance on your student loans forgiven.  Let's dive into each aspect of Public Service Loan Forgiveness qualifications.  Check if You Have Qualifying Loans  Only Direct Loans qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. You can check your loan type with your student loan servicer. If you do not have direct loans, you can consolidate your student loans into a direct consolidation loan to qualify.    Does Your Employment Qualify?  Any full-time job in a government organization at any level or with any non-profit organization that is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) will allow you to qualify for public service. Government positions include jobs at the federal, state, local, and tribal level. Time spent working full-time for the Peace Corps or Americorps as a volunteer can also count as qualified employment.  You must work a qualifying job for ten years. But you should note that you don't have to work the same qualifying job for the entire time. Nor do you have to work your ten years consecutively. But you do need ten years of qualifying payments while working for a qualifying employer to complete the program.  Qualifying Repayment Plans and Payments  To qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, you have to be on the right repayment plan. All income-driven repayment plans currently offered by federal student loan servicers qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness.  Payments made under the standard repayment plan also qualify. But this plan allows for full repayment of your balance in ten years, so there would be nothing left to forgive. For your payments to count, make all of your payments no later than fifteen days after your due date and always pay the full amount indicated on your bill.  Submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness  Employment Certification Form  annually to be sure that your employer qualifies for the program. I recommend filling this form out every year even if your employer has not changed. This will help you be sure you are still meeting all the requirements of the program.  Note that there's only one student loan servicer that is a part of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, FedLoan.  If you have a different servicer, when you fill out the Employment Certification Form, send it to FedLoan, and your student loan servicer will be changed to FedLoan.  ***  After completing your 120 payments, fill out and submit the  Public Service Loan Forgiveness Application for Forgiveness  to be sure your payments are counted and your loans are forgiven.

{"text": " There are a couple of ways to get out of debt and back on track. It may seem overwhelming, but you can do this!  It's time to budget  To start with, make a budget. Total up all your monthly take home pay.  Next, subtract all of your expenses. You will want to subtract your housing, car, gas, food, entertainment, clothing, and insurance, just to name a few.  Where is your money going?  If you aren't sure where your money went, go to your checking account online. Take a 30-day period and categorize all your spending. If it's groceries, put the dollar amount under the heading \u201cgroceries.\u201d Do the same for eating out, snacks and drinks, entertainment, clothes, or any other category you discover.  Add up the columns so you have an idea of what you spend on each one for a month.  Put it all together  Put your expense figures into the budget. Then subtract the total spending from the total income. Hopefully you have a positive number. If not, go through each category and decide where you can cut back until you do have a positive number.  Doing this will allow you to free up extra money to put towards your debt, and will also keep you from going further into debt because you are running out of money each month.  Your debt reduction plan  To set up a debt reduction plan, I recommend  this free website . You will put in all of your debts, including the dollar amount owed, the interest rate, and the minimum payment. From there, you put in the extra money you have to apply each month. It will calculate how long it will take you to get out of debt, and even print you a calendar showing how much to pay monthly on each debt.  Is credit counseling right for you?  Another option is to work with a non-profit credit counseling agency.  They will negotiate lower payments, a lower interest rate, or both with your creditors. From there, you pay them a small monthly fee along with the total new monthly payments and they make your payments for you.  This can be extremely helpful if you are feeling overwhelmed, are receiving phone calls, or can't get out from under the debt due to huge interest rates.  You can find a legitimate credit counseling agency with the  National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) .  The burden of debt can be overwhelming. Making a plan to tackle this debt can help lower your stress level and allow you to see a way out. With some hard work, you can be debt free.   We're all rooting for you! '\""}
{"text": " We all know the saying: \u201cThere are two certainties in life: death and taxes.\u201d Since taxes are one of our largest ongoing expenses, we're all interested in keeping them as low as possible. Fortunately, the government has created tax breaks in order to incentive citizens to do things it considers valuable to society.  For example, the government wants people to buy homes, have children, donate to charity, and start businesses. Thus, the government established the mortgage interest deduction, child tax credit, and charitable deduction, and all business expenses are deductible against business income.  It's important to be aware of these tax benefits when making decisions. Any money that doesn't go to taxes can be put toward your other financial goals.  How tax deductions work  You can subtract tax deductible expenses from your taxable income. Since your taxable income is lower, you could pay less taxes.  Let's assume a married couple is in the 12%  tax bracket  (combined income between $19,750 and $80,250). A $1,000 tax-deductible expense would lower their taxable income by $1,000. Since the couple wouldn't owe taxes on that $1,000 of income, they would save $120 in taxes (12% of $1,000) that they otherwise would have owed.  It's important to understand that tax deductions lower your taxable income,  not  taxes owed. Have you heard anyone say, \u201cIt's okay if I spend that money because I can write it off on my taxes\u201d? Some people treat tax deductions as if they are getting their money back. A more accurate way to look at a tax-deductible expense is that the government provides a percentage subsidy of that expense equaling your marginal tax rate.  So in the case of this example couple, the government subsidized 12% of that $1,000 expense and the couple's taxes were lowered by $120 (12% of $1,000). Not bad, but not the same as a 100% subsidy.    Tax deductions vs. tax credits  Unlike tax deductions, tax credits decrease taxes owed dollar-for-dollar. For instance, if that same married couple above had a child, they could claim the  child tax credit  ($2,000 per child). Let's say they had a combined taxable income of $60,000 and would ordinarily owe $7,000 in federal income taxes. The child tax credit would lower their tax owed to $5,000.  So which is better, tax deductions or tax credits? It depends on your tax bracket. Taxpayers in lower brackets often benefit more from tax credits, while taxpayers in higher brackets tend to benefit more from tax deductions. For instance, our example couple would need $16,667 in tax deductions to save $2,000 in taxes (12% of $16,667 = $2,000). Let's compare that to another couple earning $350,000, putting them in the 32% bracket. That couple would only need $6,250 in tax deductions to save $2,000 in taxes (32% of $6,250 = $2,000).   Standard deduction, itemized deductions, and above-the-line deductions  Since the new tax bill passed, it's even more important to pay attention to whether you itemize deductions or take the  standard deduction . The IRS grants every taxpayer a no-questions-asked standard deduction amount. You can either claim the standard deduction or itemize your deductions and claim that amount. You cannot do both. After adding up your deductible expenses for the year, if that total is larger than the standard deduction, it makes sense to itemize. If your total itemized deductions are lower than the standard deduction, then you should take the standard deduction.  The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) doubled the standard deduction. It is now  $12,400 for single taxpayers and $24,800 for married couples . After this change, a lot of taxpayers who usually itemized have found that it's no longer in their interests. An estimated  13.7% of taxpayers  will itemize in 2019 compared to 31.1% if pre-TCJA law were still in effect. This means you may no longer be getting tax benefits from some of your expenses, which increases the real cost of those expenses to you.  Lastly,  above-the-line deductions  can be used whether you itemize or not, so they are very valuable.  Using this knowledge throughout the year  When you understand how tax deductions work, you can think about them not just at tax time, but also proactively. You can think about how the decisions you make today will impact your future tax bill.  For instance, in 2025, the standard deduction amounts are set to return to where they were before (essentially cut in half). Today's larger standard deduction has caused some of you to start claiming that when you previously itemized. In that case, it could make sense to delay 2024 deductible expenses ( medical bills or charitable donations) into 2025. You will likely claim the larger TCJA standard deduction in 2024 either way, so those expenses provide no tax benefits. Spending that money in 2025 would provide additional deductions, because you would likely be back to itemizing after the standard deduction goes back down.  '\""}

There are so many out there to choose from and some are overly complicated and others require too much work.  Submitted by Brittany.  Let's check out a few of them and talk about how to choose.  Your Credit Union or Bank  Your credit union or bank probably has an app that allows you to create a budget and track your spending. The challenge, which is true for most apps, is that getting set up can be time consuming. If most of your transactions are electronic, like cards or automatic transfers, this may be the best choice for you since most of your income and expenses will be captured.  Mint  If you use a lot of cash or other cards, Mint might be a better option. Mint is one of the most well known apps and it's owned by Intuit. One of the strengths of Mint is that it allows you to aggregate all of your accounts (including your bank, credit, investments, and even the value of your other assets), so you have a built-in balance sheet. Mint is still free, but they try to sell products, so beware of that if you choose this app.  You Need a Budget (YNAB)  I'm checking out You Need A Budget, affectionately called YNAB,  again  for the 34 day trial. There is some setup (6 \u201ceasy\u201d steps) and it is NOT free, but the cost may be worth it if you are willing to \u201cgive every dollar a job\u201d and consult the app BEFORE you make a purchase. This is actually the real value of YNAB: being able to easily check your budget before you spend.  What's right for you?  So, how do you decide? First of all, it is great that there are many good apps to help you track your spending \u2013 but the  best  app is the one that works for you. Check out the few we have talked about here and choose one to try. If you find that in 60 days you aren't satisfied, try another one (think of it as a \u201cPlan B\u201d) and remember that the point is to find a system that  works for you .  Be gentle with yourself during the set up. It doesn't have to be perfect to be helpful. Start with your living expenses (what you  must  pay) and add your lifestyle expenses (what you  choose  to spend) over a month or two. Keep in mind that you are building new habits and that can take time. Practice makes better.  Let me know which one(s) you choose to try. If you are joining me on the YNAB trial period, let me know what you think and I'll do the same at the end of my 34 day trial. '\""}

My favorite book on this topic is\\\\xa0 The Number \\\\xa0by Lee Eisenberg. Check it out. (Literally! Save your money and see if you can find it at your local library.)  What does your retirement look like?  \u201cRetirement\u201d means many things, so first decide what it means to you. When I was 44, I realized I was not going to have enough to retire at the traditional age of 67 (my full retirement age according to the\\\\xa0 Social Security Administration ) so I knew I would have to come up with a solution. I chose to go back to school and that meant longer work life AND student loans. Now, if I hadn't been willing to do that I would not be writing to you right now (see, we would have BOTH missed out) but I took the (calculated) risk, found something I love and became an expert. This means that I'm going to be working well into my 70s \u2013 but doing something I love! '\""}
{"text": "    When you're ready to start or build your credit, it's important to understand your credit score. If you understand your credit score, you'll be able to grow and improve it, maybe even someday achieving a perfect score.  When people discuss credit scores, they are often talking about the FICO Score. The FICO Score, created by the Fair Isaac Corporation, considers different pieces of your spending and credit usage to create a credit score for you. This score is used by lenders to assess your credit risk.  FICO scores range from 300 to 850, with 850 being a perfect score. While it is difficult, if you understand what goes into a credit score and how to use your credit effectively, you can get a perfect FICO Score.  To help you on your quest for perfect credit, here are the five factors that impact your credit score.  1. Paying on Time  Your payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO Credit score. This is the largest category. So, to work towards that perfect credit score, you want to make your credit card payments on time and in full each month. Remember to also make your full loan payments each month. On-time loan payments will also help increase your credit score.  2. Available Credit  This category looks at how much of your credit you use. It accounts for 30% of your FICO score. When lenders look at your available credit, they are comparing how much credit you are using to the total credit available to you. You want to keep your credit usage to 30% or less of your available credit. This means that you do not want to use more than 30% of the credit that is available to you. So, if you have a $1,000 credit limit, try to use $300 or less.     3. Length of Credit History  The longer your credit history, the higher this part of your credit score will be. The length of your credit history accounts for 15% of your FICO score. Initially, this part of your score will be low because you haven't had credit for a long time. But over time this area will improve as you have and maintain your credit. Remember that if you have old credit cards that you've had for a while but don't use any more, you should keep them open. Just tuck them away somewhere and don't use them. Closing them will decrease your length of credit history and hurt your credit score.  4. Credit Mix  Your credit mix, or the different types of credit that you have, makes up 10% of your credit score. To improve your credit score and get to 850, you need to have a good mix of installment credit, or loans, and revolving credit, or credit cards. Do not take out loans or open credit cards just to increase your score. But take out loans that you need and can afford to pay back, and use your credit cards responsibly to help your score improve.  5. New Credit  There are times when you need to open a new credit card or take out a new loan, and that is just fine. But opening too many new accounts at one time can hurt your credit score. This is because opening several accounts at one time can indicate that you are a risky borrower. New credit accounts for 10% of your FICO score, so only open new credit when you need it.  Working Towards Your Perfect Score  When you are just starting out, it can seem daunting to try to build your score. Understanding the factors that affect your credit score can help you use them to your advantage. Make your payments on time, don't use too much of your available credit, don't open too many cards at once, and maintain a good mix of loans and credit cards. The longer you manage your credit well, the better your score will be. It will take time, but with dedication and good money management, you can work your way to a perfect credit score of 850!

{"text": " It's no secret that Americans are worried about having enough money to pay the bills. Employees have been laid off or furloughed in record numbers. The Department of Labor is reporting  17 million layoffs  as of April 9, 2020.  If you are one of these people, I am so sorry to hear that. It's hard to have finances to worry about on top of a pandemic. But all is not lost. Here are some financial tips based on recommendations from the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  (CFPB).  Create a crisis budget  Assess your financial situation and determine your money priorities. If you can't pay all your bills due to a cash shortage,  pay your living expenses first . Focus on bills like your mortgage, rent, car note, utilities, food, and medicine over any other debts, especially credit cards. These will keep a roof over your head, the lights on, and food on the table. Plus, this will keep you healthy until you can return to work.  What to do if you can't pay your bills  During these hard times, contact your creditors or landlord directly and let them know your situation.  Check your credit report to assess your creditworthiness. You may want to consider a new loan or additional credit as a bridge until you can return to work. Falling behind on your payments can have a lasting impact on your credit score, even years from now.  If you need professional guidance on a financial issue, first seek assistance from your credit union or bank. You may also want to consider finding an  Accredited Financial Counselor  (AFC) or a  HUD -approved housing counselor if you have an issue with your mortgage or servicer.  Beware of fraud  Be cautious of emails, texts, or social media posts that may be selling fake products or information about coronavirus cases. Never give out personal information over the phone like your Social Security Number.  Unemployment benefits and the CARES Act  If you've been laid off, you may eligible for expanded benefits under the CARES Act in addition to  regular unemployment benefits .  The CARES Act creates a new temporary federal program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA). Pandemic Unemployment Assistance provides up to 39 weeks of unemployment benefits. If you receive PUA benefits, you can collect an additional $600 weekly benefit amount (WBA) under the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) program.  The bill also covers independent contractors. You may be eligible for PUA benefits if you're unemployed, partially employed, or unable to work because of the COVID-19 crisis.  Hopefully, these suggestions can guide you and your finances through this crisis. '\""}

{"text": " Just before 2020 ended and 2021 began, President Trump signed a second pandemic relief bill. This bill included a second round of stimulus checks, or Economic Impact Payments, that will be sent to Americans under certain income thresholds in the coming weeks. Some of these checks have already started filtering in via direct deposit. As people struggle to make ends meet, there are lots of questions surrounding who will receive the stimulus, how much they will receive, and when it will hit their bank accounts.  How Much Can I Receive from the Second Stimulus Payment?  Those who are eligible for this stimulus payment will receive $600 per individual. So, a married couple eligible for payments would receive $600 each or $1,200 total. Additionally, eligible families will receive an extra $600 per child age 16 and under.  Who is Eligible for the Second Stimulus Payment?  Eligibility to receive a second stimulus check will be based on your 2019 tax return. An individual who recorded an adjusted gross (AGI) income of $75,000 or less on their 2019 taxes will qualify for the full $600. If their AGI was greater than $75,000, the benefits they receive will start to be phased out at a rate of $5 for every $100 they earn above the threshold.  For those who file their taxes with Head of Household status, the AGI limit is $112,500. Anyone at or below this threshold should receive full benefits. Their benefits will be phased out above this threshold at a rate of $5 for every $100 they earn above it.  For a married couple, the AGI limit is twice that of an individual, or $150,000 or less. Anyone at or below this threshold will receive full benefits. For those with a higher AGI, benefits phase out at the same rate as individuals and those who file with Head of Household status.  If they meet the income requirements, mixed-status immigrant families will also be eligible for the second stimulus relief check. This is a change from the first stimulus relief check. This means that U.S. citizens and green card holders who meet the income threshold will be eligible for the $600 relief check and the $1,200 check from the first stimulus bill, even if they file a joint tax return with an undocumented spouse.  Who is Not Eligible for the Second Stimulus Payment?  It is important to note that child dependents who are 17 or older do not qualify. This is based on a family's 2019 tax filing. So, if a child turned 17 in the second half of 2020, after taxes were filed, they could still qualify.  Adult dependents who are claimed on someone else's tax return also will not qualify. This means college students who are claimed on their parent's tax returns and older adults who are claimed on someone else's taxes won't get the payments.  When Will I Receive the Second Stimulus Payment?  The IRS is already delivering stimulus funds. Some individuals have already received theirs via direct deposit. And more funds go out each day. If you have direct deposit information on file with the IRS, they will deposit funds directly into that account. If you don't have current direct deposit information on file with the IRS but who are eligible, a check or a debit card will be sent by mail. You can claim the Economic Impact Payments on your 2020 tax return in 2021 if you are eligible but don't receive them.  Final Thoughts and Additional Resources  The second round of payments comes at a time when many are struggling and will hopefully provide some relief. It is important to be sure that you understand the eligibility requirements and the process so you can get benefits for which you are eligible.   If you are waiting on your payment, you may want to track it. To track your payment, use the IRS website's  Get My Payment tool . Track your payment using only the IRS website. Do not give out personal information to sources you don't know and trust. For additional information regarding the second round of Economic Impact Payments, check out the IRS's  Frequently Asked Questions .  This situation is still evolving, so check with the IRS if you have additional questions or need more information. '\""}

The ban on  evictions for certain renters has been extended through April 30, 2021 . You will need to complete a  declaration form  indicating which eligibility requirements you meet. You may still be required to pay the rent due. This order protects you from eviction if you are not able to pay rent, not for any other rental violations.  What Steps Should I Take If I'm Facing Eviction?  If you are struggling to pay your rent, address the situation now. Don't wait until you receive an eviction notice. Contact the landlord as soon as possible to discuss the situation. Be honest about your financial situation and explain how the loss of housing will impact your family. Have a plan before talking to the landlord. The plan should include resources you have, a suggested payment arrangement, and the length of time you would like to implement the arrangement. Maintain an open dialogue so you can find a solution that is agreeable to both you and your landlord. Keep a written record of the meeting and the decision that was made.  Resources That Can Help If You're Facing Eviction  Facing eviction can be a very stressful event and may lead to additional financial issues.

{"text": "We all face risks every day, from driving a car to the ever-present risk of illness or natural disasters. Protecting yourself from these varied risks is a complex task.  Consider a relatively simple risk: adopting a pet. Picture your newly adopted dog, maybe a little frazzled by his new environment. You're out on a walk and a neighbor approaches your dog. The dog takes a nip at the stranger and now your neighbor has to go to the emergency room for stitches. As she backs away she lets you know that she intends to sue you for the emergency room cost.  Even if you have homeowners' or renters' insurance, your policy may not cover this liability. There's no \u201cperfect\u201d or \u201cright\u201d insurance plan; this is another case where you need to consider your unique circumstances and determine how much risk you want covered.  Here are a few steps to get started:  Do an Inventory  The first thing you need to know is what people, possessions, and other things you want covered. It might help to make a list of everything you can think of. Consider these broad categories:   Health  \u2013 your own and other people (or animals) in your family  Life  \u2013 how will your family cope with the loss of a family breadwinner?  Children  \u2013 how will they be protected?  Property  \u2013 what land, structures, or possessions are vital to your family?  Income  \u2013 what if you or another family member are unable to work?   Assess Your Risk  There are four ways to manage risk \u2013 some are more expensive, and some may not always be practical. One or all of these methods may be appropriate to make sure you are covered adequately.  Risk Avoidance  Eliminate the risk by not engaging in activities that could trigger the risk. For example, you might decide that having a pet or going on a vacation is not worth the risk, so you're not going to adopt a pet or go on vacation. Of course, this is not always practical, and requires you to sacrifice a lot.  Risk Transfer  An insurance policy allows you to transfer the risk to another entity (the insurance company). Of course, you can never fully transfer a risk. If you're in a car crash and you have car insurance, your  financial  risk will be covered, but that doesn't erase any injuries or legal liability.  Risk Reduction  There are easy things you can do to limit risk and increase precautions. For example, to limit the risk of a house fire, you could install smoke detectors. To limit the risk of injury when driving, wear a seatbelt and drive carefully.  Risk Retention  Risk retention means that you decide to accept a risk. In an ideal world, all of your risk would be covered in some way, but of course that may not always be possible. Maybe you decide that you can't afford to buy a certain type of insurance, and that you would prefer to mitigate your risk and accept any unfortunate consequences. Even if you buy insurance, most plans still require you to first pay a deductible; this deductible cost counts as a risk that you retain.  Build an Asset Protection Plan  Now that you know the different methods for dealing with risk, it's time to sort out how you want to manage the risks in your life. Put together a plan for each item that you identified in your inventory. It could look something like this:     Asset  Approach  Action    Life  Transfer  Research and buy life insurance     Reduce  Eat healthy and exercise    Auto  Transfer & Retain  Buy car insurance, but retain some\\\\xa0 risk with a high-deductible plan     It can be difficult to think about the unpleasant possibilities that life could throw at us at any time. Building an asset protection plan can offer you reassurance that you'll be able to address these unexpected life events. Who knows, with proper planning you may still be able to adopt that dog! '\""}
{"text": " There are several ways you can apply for a  Marketplace  health insurance plan. During Open Enrollment, you can shop, compare, and apply directly through  HealthCare.gov . However, some states have created their own \u201cState Based Marketplace\u201d or \u201cexchange.\u201d If you live in  a state that runs their own Marketplace , you can enroll directly through their site.  You can also enroll through a secure and trusted partner of HealthCare.gov, like  HealthSherpa . HealthSherpa offers the same plans and prices with no extra costs. Plus, HealthSherpa was the very first company approved to have the entire enrollment experience on their own site. It makes the enrollment process much easier and more streamlined for anyone looking to shop for an Obamacare plan. If you want extra help, the HealthSherpa Consumer Advocate team can walk you through the process over the phone.  If you don't have access to a phone or computer, you can submit a paper application. You'll receive your eligibility results in up to two weeks, and then begin your enrollment process.  Don't forget that not everyone who sells health insurance online offers Marketplace insurance. So if you choose to buy your insurance online but not through HealthCare.gov, make sure you use a trusted partner like HealthSherpa to ensure that you are buying a Marketplace plan. Some sellers might only offer short-term plans that come with low premiums, and also cover very little in terms of preventive care, pre-existing conditions, and the kinds of essential health benefits guaranteed by Marketplace plans.

{"text": " While the third stimulus payment \u2014  which we just wrote about  \u2014 is a hot topic for Americans right now, there's actually a lot more to the  American Rescue Plan . Here are some of the additional benefits you could get from the relief package.   Additional Support to Families  In addition to stimulus payments, the American Rescue Plan helps families with three types of tax credits: a Child Tax Credit (CTC), the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and tax credits for child or dependent care.   Child Tax Credit (CTC)  Eligible families can receive more money through the Child Tax Credit than before. For one year, the American Rescue Plan  raises the CTC  from a baseline of $2,000 to:  $3,600 for each child under age 6 $3,000 for each child between ages 6-17   The plan also sends more money to families who have seen a loss of income. Even if families have earned no income this year, they can still receive the full benefit. Families can receive these funds as fully refundable tax credits \u2014 meaning that the government will give you back more money than you may owe in taxes.    Note : The payments could go out monthly or periodically instead of annually, starting in July. It's a good idea to watch for updates!   Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)   The American Rescue Plan expands the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) eligibility to help more low- to moderate-income workers and families through the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Workers without children will see substantial benefits. Previously, the lower age limit for childless workers to qualify was 25; that changes to 19 with the American Rescue Plan. There is no upper age limit anymore, and the amount of the credit also goes up substantially for childless workers \u2014 it triples! That means the maximum could be $1,502 (instead of $543) for one year.   This year, there is a special rule (called the \u201c lookback rule \u201d) in place that allows you to get the most EITC that you can. When filing your taxes, you can use either your 2020 or 2019 income \u2014 whichever will give you the most money back in your tax refund.   Tip : Talk to a  tax preparer  about the lookback option, and keep your 2019 records available.  Child and Dependent Care Tax Credits (CDCTC)   Eligible families will get help paying for child and dependent care this year through expanded Child and Dependent Care Tax Credits. In addition to more funds, the CDCTC will be fully refundable, meaning that these are refunds that could come back to you in the form of a check or payment from the IRS.  Read more details.  Other Types of Support in the American Rescue Plan  Expanded Unemployment   The American Rescue Plan will extend federal unemployment benefits through September 6, 2021, at $300 per week. Note: The first $10,200 of  unemployment income  will not be taxable under this plan; after that amount, unemployment will be considered taxable income.  Paid Leave  The relief plan extends family and medical leave policies:  Paid sick leave and paid family leave is now extended from March 31, 2021, to September 31, 2021 An employer can claim paid family credit of up to $12,000 per employee Self-employed individuals can claim the credit for up to 60 days  Housing, Food, and Utilities  There is help on the way in terms of food and housing assistance. The latest stimulus package will boost Pandemic-EBT and WIC programs. Pandemic-EBT is a program through which schoolchildren can receive temporary emergency nutrition benefits loaded on EBT cards.  WIC is a program that supports low-income women and infants. The American Rescue Plan also includes provisions to help Americans with utility costs, emergency rental assistance, mortgage assistance, and homeless relief services.   Tip : Find  help with housing  and  food assistance .  Tip : Here's what to do if you are  facing eviction during COVID-19 .  Small Business Support  Small businesses will receive federal help through grants, Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Advance grants, and PPP loans. This includes restaurants, live music venues, nonprofits, and more businesses that have been hard-hit by the pandemic.  Health Care  If you lose your job or have reduced hours and lose your employer-sponsored health insurance, the federal government will cover your COBRA premiums fully through September. There is additional support to help lower healthcare costs for families, the unemployed, and the uninsured.\\\\xa0  Student Loans  The federal student loan moratorium has been extended to September 30, 2021. You won't be required to make monthly payments until then, even if you have already received notice from your student loan servicer that it's time to pay.

{"text": " How Do Tax-Advantaged Accounts Work?  When you contribute to a retirement account like an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) or a qualified employer-sponsored retirement plan (like a 401K), you receive a tax advantage. If the account is a traditional account, you may be able to reduce your taxable income for the current year. However, you'll pay taxes when you withdraw them in retirement. If the account is a Roth, you won't be taxed on those funds when you withdraw them in retirement. Both types of accounts can grow tax free. And for both accounts, withdrawing funds \u201cearly\u201d (before retirement if they aren't qualified withdrawals) can result in a tax penalty.  The tax advantages of these accounts can really be helpful in building up money for retirement. Which of these accounts is best for you depends on your specific tax and income situation, and your personal preferences.   What is the Retirement Savings Contribution Credit?  For some of us, we can actually double dip on tax savings for retirement. Not only can we get the tax advantages, but we can get the Saver's Credit as well. This credit is called the \u201cRetirement Savings Contributions Credit.\u201d It's designed to encourage people to invest money into retirement accounts. You may be able to take this credit for making eligible contributions to your IRA or employer-sponsored retirement plan.  See If You Qualify for the Retirement Savings Contribution Credit  If you use tax software and contribute to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, it should be checking if you qualify. Just make sure you enter the letters and numbers from Box 12 of your W-2 in the software. The more money you earn, the less you get for this credit until it phases out entirely. The maximum credit is $2,000 for Married Filing Joint and $1,000 for all other filers. The maximum contribution that can be used in the calculation is $4,000 for Married Filing Jointly and $2,000 for all other filers. Whether or not you qualify is based on your Adjusted Gross Income, as shown in the chart below for tax year 2020. Also, you must be 18 years of age or older, not a student (generally speaking), and not someone else's dependent.  2020 Retirement Savings Contribution Credit Amounts   *Single, married filing separately, or qualifying widow(er)  An Example of the Retirement Savings Contribution Credit  If you are single with an Adjusted Gross Income of $20,000 and you contributed $2,000 to your employer sponsored 401K, your credit would be 20% of $2,000. So you would receive a tax credit of $400. Please note that this credit is not refundable. This means if you've already reduced your tax liability to zero through deductions and other credits, you won't receive the benefit of this credit.   There aren't many opportunities for \u201cdouble dipping\u201d tax savings in our tax code. If you can take advantage of this one, it can help you improve your finances. But just like other credits and deductions that you may take, make sure that it fits both your financial and tax situation before investing to get this credit.

{"text": "Since we know that everything affects everything, let's talk about how our financial lives are impacted by our families. Over 80% of SaverLife members live with at least one other person\u2014be that a parent, child, partner, or roommate\u2014and even if you are single, you may have heard that having a baby can really break the budget (that may be enough to freak you out!). Every family is unique and every family has different priorities and goals. You may be saving for your kids' education, your dream wedding, a family vacation, or a safe place for your kids to grow up.  Every change in family structure, whether you are getting married, moving in with a partner, or having children\u2014is a big financial decision that involves navigating a complicated financial landscape. Here are some ideas for icebreakers to start important conversations about family changes.  Getting Married  If you're preparing for a new marriage or partnership, here are some questions I think you should spend some time answering for yourself, and also discussing candidly with your partner:   What is your current financial situation?  How do you live with money now?  What is your money \u201cprofile\u201d? Are you a saver or a spender?  What financial expectations do you have for your partner? These could be expectations about the decisions they'll make or their financial behaviors.  How will you handle  differences in money habits and attitudes ?  How will you determine individual and shared financial priorities?   If you're able to talk honestly about these issues and feel confident that you're on the same page with your partner, that's a really good place to start your financial journey together.  Your Growing Family  Likewise, having or adopting a child will impact all aspects of your financial life and brings its own sets of challenges and rewards. Here are some more questions that you should spend time answering:   What are your core values about money and family?  What adjustments are you willing to make to accommodate this change?  How will you address unexpected health issues, special needs, job changes, and income fluctuations?   In addition to these big-picture questions, there are also some logistical issues that you need to sort out, including:   Medical expenses: What is covered by your insurance? What are the gaps?  Cash flow: What will change?  Insurance: What must change?  Taxes (BONUS!): Your cute little tax deduction!  Estate planning and guardianship arrangements: Who will take care of your little one if you can't?  Long-term savings: What do you hope to provide for your child for college? (And what are your own expectations for retirement?)   With a baby, there are both one-time expenses and ongoing expenses. How will you address both? A cool resource from  BabyCenter  can help you come up with a rough estimate of first-year baby costs.  Of course it's not possible to think about everything, but you can plan for changes you are anticipating (even if they are far off into the future) by taking a few steps to build your financial security.

{"text": "What is \u201ctrailing interest\u201d? I just got a credit card bill with interest charged after I paid it off!  Submitted by Sasha.  When you are using credit cards, timing is everything. The difference between the date you make a credit purchase and the date you pay can have a huge impact on the \u201ccost of the money\u201d you are borrowing. If you make a purchase and pay before the due date, you fall within the \u201cgrace period\u201d for most cards. In that case, you'll usually pay nothing in interest! That is the financial ninja move we all want to practice because when you do this, you are using the credit card company's money for free. The catch is, not all credit card companies offer a grace period and some begin accruing interest from the moment of purchase. There are a few things to note here so let's break it down.  Trailing (or residual) interest is accrued from the time the bill was sent to you (the closing date) and when they receive your payment.\\\\xa0If you pay the full current balance online immediately, you can avoid trailing interest.  If you carry a balance on your credit cards, you will almost always pay trailing interest because it is accruing every day (even if you aren't making new purchases).  Know before you owe  Thinking about your credit card usage before you make a purchase can help you stay on track to pay in full before that interest hits. It's best to read all of the terms of your credit card (yeah, we know they don't make it easy). At a minimum, read the fees, due dates, and grace period info. Make sure you understand all of the costs and how to avoid them.  Pay attention to your \u201cstatement balance\u201d and the \u201ccurrent balance\u201d as any new purchases and interest will be reflected there. To avoid additional interest, pay the current balance in full. Often, paying the statement balance will avoid interest as any new charges fall into the new billing cycle. Again, this depends on the card company's grace period policy.  Timing is everything. Using credit cards for your regular monthly expenses can be a convenient way to manage money. Set a goal of using credit cards only when you know you can pay the balance in full. '\""}
{"text": " When I first became a financial planner, my specialty was small business owners. I also headed my local Chamber of Commerce's Small Business committee. Over the years, I received a lot of excellent business advice. Below are the top five most impactful business tips I've heard:  Get your personal financial house in order  If you plan to leave your job, create a budget based on your new income. Live on your new budget for three to six months before quitting to gauge if you can live on the new budget. Have at least six months of income saved for household emergencies. In my first six months of business, I had over $5,000 in unexpected expenses. My emergency savings account was a life-saver. Pay off your debts, particularly your credit card debts.  Get buy-in from your family  Starting a business is going to be a sacrifice for everyone in your family. Starting a business is an emotional, relational, time, and financial strain on your family. If any of these areas are already suffering, business ownership at this time may make it worse. Discuss with your family your new work hours and any changes that may impact your family.   Take the time to research  As a former head of a Small Business Committee, I saw so many businesses come and go because they did not study their business idea. Just because you think it's a great idea does not mean people will pay you what you think your idea is worth it.  SCORE  is a free mentorship program for business owners. A mentor can save you thousands of dollars in mistakes by helping you navigate business decisions.  Create a business plan  I saw many businesses fail because they did not have a business plan. A business plan can help you do the following:  Assess how much money you would need to start your business (it's always higher than you think) Help you estimate how long before your business breaks even (it's typically longer than you think) Decide if your business location is ideal Market your business to get clients Luckily you can tap into a lot free or low-cost help to starting and maintaining your business such as  SCORE ,  SBA ,  Small Business Development Centers , and your local  chamber of commerce  or business association.  Start Small  Consider using what some call an upside-down business strategy. The model takes advantage of the low cost and ease of creating an online presence through social media and a website to build an audience of your future customers. The low cost allows you to refine your message and understand what your audience wants. Once you create an audience of people who know, like, and trust you, you can confidently develop products and services because you know from your audience what they want. This model is less costly and risky than the traditional way of starting a business, which is to start with the product, then try to create a message.  No matter what method you use, the important thing is to start from where you are and just get started. '\""}

Here are a few things you can do now to make tax season a breeze.  Check how changes in tax laws will affect you  Tax law changes frequently, and this past year brought a lot of big changes. Before you panic, know the facts and how they affect you.  This article  is a good place to start. There's a lot of detail, so focus your attention on these issues that I pulled from the article and the IRS website because I want your life to be easier (you're welcome):   Reduced tax rates \u2013 The 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered U.S. tax rates. While the number of tax brackets remained at seven, the rates were lowered and the income thresholds were increased (mostly for high income earners).  Taxpayers can choose between using the standard deduction or itemized deductions. Itemizing deductions means adding up all of the individual tax deductions to which you're entitled and then subtracting them from your adjusted gross income (AGI). (Note: Adjusted gross income is your total income minus a few adjustments. Common adjustments to income include traditional IRA contributions and student loan interest, just to name a few.)  Elimination of personal exemptions \u2013 this makes me sad, but we will see what happens with these changes:  Increased standard deductions: $12,000 for singles, $18,000 for heads of households and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly  Increased child tax credit: $2,000 per qualifying child and a new $500 credit for other qualifying dependents  Changes to itemized deductions     The  IRS website has a calculator  so you can do a \u201cpaycheck check up\u201d to see if you are withholding the right amount for your situation. That won't help much for this year but you can get a jump on next year planning by checking out your withholding on your W-4 (yes, you can change it).  Reach out for reliable help  Each person and situation is different, so if you have questions, you may need to consult a professional to find the answer. Just make sure you're getting help from a reliable source, such as the  IRS website  or a  VITA site .  Get help with your small business taxes  If you're self-employed, you probably already know that you have different tax obligations. To get started, check out  Small Business Taxes: The Virtual Workshop , a helpful video series from the IRS. It covers everything from setting up a retirement plan to withholding taxes from your payroll, and lots more.  Be on the lookout for tax scams  Got a call from the IRS? It might not have actually been the IRS.  Watch this video  to hear directly from the IRS about the increase in tax scams and how to protect yourself. I've also documented several other  tax scams that you should be aware of .  Tax time can be stressful, so be gentle with yourself.

{"text": " First off, congratulations for having an emergency fund! Approximately 25% of Americans couldn't cover an unexpected $400 bill, let alone a month of expenses. To answer the question of whether or not you should drain your emergency fund because of coronavirus, that all depends on your situation.  Do you need to drain your emergency fund? If you've lost your job or had a cut in your hours or salary, then using the money in your emergency fund is warranted. Whether you need to drain your account is another question.  When you have a loss of income, the first thing to do is to revise your budget, cutting out all of the extras. This includes eating out, getting coffee out, and entertainment. All the little extras. Your budget should consist only of necessities such as housing, utilities, car payment, insurance, gas, medicine, and food. Cover your basic survival needs so you have the ability to look for employment.  Next, evaluate all of your income. Think of new ways to come up with extra cash. This could include selling unwanted or unneeded items, babysitting for friends, and donating plasma. Once you've done this, determine how much you need to take out of savings to cover only the necessities.    The goal is to be as frugal as possible so that you only need to use some of your savings. This will help to stretch that fund out as long as possible. It'll also give you time to survive until hopefully the tide turns, and you can get back to full employment. '\""}

{"text": "    Equifax, one of the top three credit reporting bureaus, considers  credit scores between 670-739 to be good credit scores . FICO is one of the most commonly used credit scoring companies.  FICO  uses information from credit bureaus like Equifax to calculate a three-digit credit score that represents your credit. The scores are calculated based on five categories:   Payment History (your record of paying your bills on time) \u2013 35% of your credit score. Amount Owed (how much of your credit are you using) \u2013 30% of your credit score. Length of Credit History (how long have you had credit) \u2013 15% of your credit score. Credit Mix (how many different types of credit you have) \u2013 10% of your credit score. New Credit (how often you are applying for credit) \u2013 10% of your credit score.  Good credit history of on-time payments, not using too much credit, not trying to get a lot of credit, and having different credit types give businesses an idea of how much they can trust you to pay your bills on time. In a nutshell, if a company feels you will pay them back, you will typically pay less than someone a business may not think will pay them back.  Here are some of the benefits of having good credit:  Lower Annual Percentage Rate (APR)  This is the interest you pay to your creditor for using their credit. The better your credit score, the less interest you pay.   No Security Deposit  Businesses often lower or even eliminate security deposits for people with good credit. Companies use deposits as \u201cinsurance,\u201d so if you don't pay your bill, the business will keep your deposit to pay the missed bill. This is why companies ask for a security deposit from people with no or low credit scores.  Buying a Car  Your credit affects your ability to own a vehicle in a few ways:  Places where you can buy a car . Some dealers will not finance someone with a poor credit score ( typically under 580 for some businesses ) The amount of your monthly payment . Your car payment is a combination of the car's principal cost and your loan interest rate mixed in with other fees: the higher your interest rate, the higher your car payment. Your ability to get car insurance . Many insurance companies  use your credit history  to decide your premiums or even if they will give you car insurance.  Buying a Home or Rent an Apartment  Your credit score significantly affects your ability to own a home due to the following:  Home loans : Your credit score determines which types of  loans you can get . The more loans you are eligible for, the better. Your credit score determines how much interest you pay, affecting your overall monthly payment. Apartments : Most landlords will review your credit report. Some apartment buildings may require a minimum credit score to approve your application. A high score may also mean a reduction in a security deposit for your apartment. It may also reduce or even eliminate a security deposit for utilities.  Homeowner's and Renter's Insurance  Like car insurance, a  homeowner's  and  renter's  insurance company will review your credit, which may impact your premiums, meaning more money you may have to pay for your insurance coverage.  Getting a job  Most employers will check your credit. Some employers, like a bank, may require you to have a good credit history. Other places, particularly those that require security clearances, may review your credit to make sure you have a good record.  Good credit history affects many areas of your life.

{"text": " Tax season is underway, but with COVID-19 affecting millions of families across the country, from job losses to medical issues, filing taxes may not be at the top of your minds. This year, more than ever, it's important to file your taxes, especially if you lost work or haven't received your full stimulus funds. The government has made a lot of stimulus and tax benefits available, and filing taxes can help you claim this money.   Even if you don't owe money or normally don't file taxes, here are three reasons to file your taxes this year.   1. Receive Your Full Stimulus Payments  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal government has sent out two rounds of stimulus checks. If you should have been eligible, but didn't receive either or both of the payments, the only way to get that money is by filing your taxes. The IRS has also made mistakes, and many Americans haven't received money from the first or second stimulus payments.   If you didn't receive the full stimulus amount from either or both of the stimulus payments, it's not too late! You may be eligible for the  Recovery Rebate Credit . The stimulus payments were based on your 2019 income, so if you faced a loss in income in 2020, if you were newly independent in 2020, or if you had additional dependents in 2020, you may receive additional money when you file your 2020 tax return. Read more about  how to claim your stimulus payment  if you haven't received it yet.  Even if you don't normally file taxes (because you're on SSI or SSDI, you're retired, or you don't meet the IRS's income threshold), you need to do so this year to claim any missing stimulus money.  2. Claim Tax Credits  There are many tax credits that you may be eligible for, from the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to the Child Tax Credit. These credits can mean more money in your pocket to support yourself and your family.  The EITC helps working Americans by issuing them a credit when they file their taxes. If you qualify, your EITC will be based on your income and number of dependents.  Read more about the EITC , including some important changes this year and how your EITC may be impacted if you received unemployment benefits.  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has a helpful website dedicated to helping you understand what  tax credits you may be eligible for and how to claim them .  Use the \u201cLookback\u201d Feature to Maximize Your Refund   Did you earn less in 2020 than 2019? You could qualify for a bigger tax refund! Congress approved a new \u201clookback rule\u201d which means you can use either your 2019 or 2020 income on your taxes to get the biggest refund possible this year. Make sure you have your 2019 tax return available when you do your taxes this year.  ***  We've also made a  cheat-sheet  on some great resources we recommend to help you navigate your taxes this year, including all of the ways you can file for free. Keep in mind that if you received unemployment benefits, you may owe taxes on those. If you run into any questions or are unsure whether you need to file, you can connect with other SaverLife members in the  forum . Either way, don't wait to file and claim the money you're due!

{"text": " After you've completed the Marketplace application, there are a number of things you may have to do next before your coverage kicks in. You can complete all of these steps through HealthCare.gov or your free HealthSherpa account.  Submitting required documentation  You may be asked to submit documents to prove your qualifying life event, your income, or citizenship. If so, you'll have 30 days to submit these documents through your HealthSherpa consumer account, your HealthCare.gov account, or by mail. If you applied for coverage through a state exchange, you'll submit these documents directly to the exchange using the instructions they provided.   Paying monthly premium  Your health insurance coverage won't begin until you've paid your first premium. Your first payment is often paid directly through your HealthCare.gov or HealthSherpa account, but is sometimes paid directly to your insurance company. If you have any questions about where your first premium payment needs to be paid, a member of the HealthSherpa Consumer Advocate Team can help. They can be reached at (844) 984-0731. Or, you can contact your new insurer directly to find out how best to make your first payment. If you do not complete your first payment by it's due date, your coverage will be cancelled.   After this first payment, you will continue to make your monthly premium payments directly to your insurance company. Please contact your insurance company should you need further instructions on how to make these payments, though most insurance companies accept payment through an online portal, via phone, or through a paper check in the mail.   Also, once you've paid your first premium, you'll usually have a 90-day grace period on any future payments before your plan is cancelled.  Coverage start date  Depending on  when you enrolled , you may have different coverage start dates.  If you enrolled during the annual Open Enrollment Period, your coverage will begin on January 1st of the upcoming year.   During a Special Enrollment Period, if you applied for coverage before the 15th of the month, your coverage will usually begin on the first day of the next month. If you apply after the 15th, it will begin on the first day of the month after next.   In some Special Enrollment Period cases, such as having a baby or adopting a child, the coverage may be retroactive to the day of the birth or adoption.  Reporting major life changes  Don't forget to report any changes to your life circumstances throughout the year. You should report a change if any of the following occur:  Someone in your tax household was offered other health insurance through an employer, even if they didn't enroll You got married or divorced You had a baby or adopted a child Someone in your tax household became eligible for Medicaid/CHIP or Medicare Someone in your tax household lost eligibility for Medicaid/CHIP A child on your plan turned 26 You became pregnant Your income changed Your citizenship or immigration status changed A member of your tax household passed away Your tax filing status changed Someone in your tax household lost coverage they were offered by an employer Your disability status changed Your status as an American Indian / Alaska Native or tribal member changed  These changes to your household circumstances can affect how much subsidy you qualify for. When you report a life change, your monthly premiums are automatically updated to account for this. However, if you don't report a change, you may have to pay money back or be owed money when you file your taxes.  You can report any of these life changes through your HealthCare.gov account. Or, if you've enrolled through a web broker like HealthSherpa, you can do this by logging in to your HealthSherpa account or calling the HealthSherpa Consumer Advocate team at (844) 984-0731.  Health insurance and your taxes  When it comes time to file your federal income tax return, you'll receive Form 1095-A in the mail. Your Form 1095-A will also be available in your HealthCare.gov account or HealthSherpa account. You must use Form 1095-A to fill out your taxes if you received a subsidy. '\""}
{"text": " Your credit history is an  important factor  for obtaining a loan, renting an apartment, and sometimes getting a job. However, it's not uncommon for a credit report to contain mistakes. For example, your credit report may show an unpaid medical bill for services that were paid by the insurance company. It may show a student loan with monthly payments even if you paid off that loan last year. Your credit report might have an account on there that is not even yours.  These are mistakes that you can correct. In fact, you have the right to get mistakes corrected at no charge. Left uncorrected, mistakes could hurt your chances of reaching other financial goals. So, what do you do?  Order your credit reports  Your first step is to order and review your credit report from all three of the major credit reporting agencies (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to see which of your credit reports has mistakes. Because they are three separate companies, each credit reporting agency can have slightly different information. You can order free copies of your credit report from all three agencies at Annual Credit Report  online  or by calling 1-877-322-8228. You also can order copies directly from the three agencies. Under Federal law, you are entitled to receive one free copy of your credit report from each credit reporting agency every 12 months.  Follow instructions provided  If you discover an error on your credit report, follow the instructions provided with your credit report on how to correct errors. You can report errors to any of the credit reporting agencies by:  calling the credit agency using the dispute portal when you get your credit report sending a written letter, including documentation, to the appropriate agency  Provide documentation  Send any additional information that is needed to correct the error. The credit reporting agency will tell you what you need to send. Get in the habit of keeping your financial records in order so it's easy to show where a mistake has occurred.  In the medical example above, call the medical provider to confirm that the insurance company paid the bill. Ask the hospital to send a letter of explanation to the credit reporting agency. To correct the student loan problem, send the credit reporting agency a copy of the document proving the loan was paid with a letter asking for a change in your record.  If an account is not yours, first contact the creditor listed on the credit report. Request more information about the account to help you determine whether the account belongs to you, is the result of identity theft, or was simply reported in error. You can dispute the information if you determine the account does not belong to you.  If you think it's fraudulent, include in your explanation that you believe the account may be related to identity theft. You can dispute the account as fraud and ask the credit agency to add a security alert to your credit report. That alert will notify creditors that your information may have been compromised.  Explain the issue  Explain the problem in a brief letter. The agency must investigate your complaint within 30-45 days and get back to you with its results. As part of the investigation, the credit reporting agency will check with the creditor whose information you are questioning. If the agency finds that the information in the credit report is incorrect, the creditor must notify the other major credit reporting agencies of the error so they can update their information.   Contact a credit if unresolved  Contact the creditor directly if the credit reporting agency disputes the error and you still believe your credit report is inaccurate. When you resolve the dispute, ask the creditor to send a correction to the credit reporting agency.   If still unresolved, tell your side of the story  Write a consumer statement of your side of the story if the issue remains unresolved.  You may write up to 100 words to explain the situation. Employees of the credit reporting agency are often available to help you write your statement. Your statement will appear on your credit report moving forward.

I'm going to have to make a few assumptions here to respond to your question.  It seems you transferred funds from an IRA into a mutual fund (taxable) account. To do this, you may have faced tax consequences if you weren't at least 59\u00bd years old (the penalty-free withdrawal age). If your mutual fund is not an IRA or other tax-advantaged account, the only decision you need to make is whether basement renovation is your financial priority.  There is no \u201cright\u201d answer about what you should or should not do with your money. The real question is, what is your overall plan for your resources? What impact will using the money have and what would happen if you don't fix the basement? When my coaching clients are faced with a decision I ask them to do the following:   Write the pros and cons of the idea/change (in your case, fixing the basement).  Write the pros and cons of doing nothing (in your case, keeping the money in your account).   If your cash flow is good and you don't have other financial concerns, which of the options is more satisfying for you? Once you make that decision, establish a budget for the repairs and decide how much you want to keep in the mutual fund. '\""}

In years past, March has typically been the month that healthcare spending picks up. People finally have their tax refund and they're able to pay for medical expenses that they may have been putting off.  Healthcare spending looks a bit different this year.

If you're worried about paying your bills, check out some  resources that may be helpful .  Grocery spending is up  While spending has decreased overall, that's not the case for groceries. Compared to a few months ago or even this same time last year, grocery spending has noticeably increased.

{"text": "Let's start with the basics. Refinancing simply means that you're replacing your existing loan with a new mortgage.  Reasons for Refinancing a Mortgage  If you're considering refinancing, your reasons may include:   A lower interest rate  Shorter (or longer) term to pay off the loan or cash out equity  Changing the type of mortgage (you may have purchased your home with an adjustable rate and now want a fixed rate)   How to Decide if Refinancing is Right For You  There are a lot of factors that go into deciding if refinancing your mortgage is right for you. I encourage you to consider:   What's the point? What is your goal with the refinance?  What is the cost? Refinancing is not free! Do the benefits outweigh the costs?  How long will you be staying in your home?  What other (competing) financial goals do you have? How will this impact those goals? For example, are you thinking of using equity to purchase rental property or improving the home? If you cash out the equity in your home and the value goes down, you may end up \u201cupside down\u201d (your mortgage is higher than the value of the home).   If You Decide to Refinance\u2026  You're not done when you make the decision \u2013 make sure you get the best possible refinancing deal. Here are my top tips for choosing a refinancing option:   Start with a  HUD-approved counselor  to learn about your options and the refinancing process (they will also provide unbiased information on a cash-out refi).  Shop around for the best rates and terms.  Watch how mortgage rates change over time. You may not catch the absolute lowest rates, but do your research so that you don't fall for a sales pitch and end up with a bad loan.  If you have a trusted banker or mortgage broker, talk to them before you decide to take action. Make sure you understand all of the costs and benefits.   Your home is most likely your largest investment, and refinancing is a major financial decision. Consider all of your other goals and priorities as you gather information. I suggest you talk it through with someone who respects your overall goals and offers objective information. '\""}
{"text": "Should I save for my child in a custodial account so he can use that money for whatever he chooses or should I save in a 529 account?  Submitted by anonymous.  Think about the goal YOU have for your child. What is the point of the savings?  A 529 is a good choice for children's savings, but there are limitations. If you want your child to have more flexibility, there are other options. A Roth IRA, for example, allows you to withdraw your original contributions without penalty. The thing I like about this option is that you can use it for your children or for your own retirement if your little darling ends up getting oodles of scholarship cash and doesn't need your money.  If you're going to stick with an account for your child, keep in mind that a 529 is treated as a parent's asset for the purpose of financial aid, whereas a custodial account is treated as the student's asset. This can result in a higher Expected Family Contribution (EFC).  If you want to learn more about options for saving for your child, you can do some additional reading about  custodial accounts  and  using IRAs for educational expenses . '\""}

{"text": " We are in the thick of tax season, and the House recently approved a  new stimulus bill . This is great news for many people, especially considering the average tax refund is around $2,500, and the expected stimulus check for a four-person household is up to $5,600. If you missed a previous stimulus payment, filing taxes allows you to receive the funds through the Recovery Rebate Credit. Many households are going to receive large sums of money.  What can you do to make this money work for you? Here are some powerful plans for your tax refund and stimulus check.  1. Debt Reduction  It has been a very rough year. The hardships created by the pandemic have caused Americans to lean more on credit cards. Using your refund and stimulus payments to chip away at debts that the pandemic may have caused is an excellent idea. The average credit card interest rate is around 16%. By getting rid of this debt, you are kicking both the balance and interest to the curb.  2. Budget for the Year  Weave the funds into your budget to reduce the burden of day-to-day living expenses throughout the year. This could be used toward specific budget items, for example, paying some of your rent in advance. You could also use it to inject extra money for whatever you need monthly. To do this, simply divide your lump sum by 12 and transfer that amount into your checking account each month.  3. Build Your Emergency Fund  If the pandemic has taught us nothing else, it's the importance of being prepared for the completely unexpected. An emergency fund is the safety net you need for the unknown. A good goal for an emergency fund is 6 months of household expenses. Don't stress if you aren't there yet; you will likely need to build up to your goal over time. Using these lump sums of money will certainly put you closer to achieving this goal.  4. Save for Retirement  Building retirement savings is key for your future. Consider contributing to a retirement account, such as a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are post-tax retirement accounts available through investment companies, banks, and credit unions. I recommend comparing fees and investment options when seeking a new IRA account. Using the average tax refund as an example, investing a one-time $2,500 lump sum with an 8% annual rate of return would turn into almost $37,000 for someone who is 35 years away from retirement.  5. Contribute to a 529 Plan  A child with just $500 saved for their college education is three times more likely to attend college than a child with no college savings. A 529 Plan is a type of investment account similar to an IRA, but the money is earmarked to help cover future education expenses. Each state has a plan through the State Treasurer's Office or offers a different state's plan. Although you can use any state's plan, there may be state income tax benefits for using the plan belonging to your state of residence. Investing just $265 one-time for a 5-year-old child with a 5% annual rate of return would provide $500 for their college expenses when they reach age 18.   A powerful plan starts with reviewing your household's current financial situation and anticipated changes. By looking at your situation and comparing the options, you can determine what powerful plan options will work best for you and your family. The right plan may be only one of these options, but it also may combine everything I've discussed. Having your powerful plan in place before receiving the lump sums will ensure the money doesn't get spent on things you have not prioritized as important.  Haven't started filing your taxes yet? Don't wait! The United Way has a free tax tool for those with W-2s called  MyFreeTaxes . You can also locate a  Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program  in your area through the IRS. '\""}

{"text": " Using coupons can be a great way to stretch your grocery budget. Whether you save $2.00 or $25.00, that is money that you can put towards your financial goals. It's easy to get started, according to  The Krazy Coupon Lady .  What to Buy with Coupons  She suggests when you are starting out, focus your energy on the expensive items. These are things like laundry detergent, diapers and baby formula. Make sure you are only buying things you need. Don't be tempted to put items in your cart just because you have a coupon. Buying items that you will never use, no matter how much you save, is still a waste of money.  Where to Find Coupons  You can find inserts of coupons in the Sunday paper. The Krazy Coupon Lady suggests going to the local recycling center for these, or buying discounted Sunday papers on Monday. If you absolutely have to buy a paper on Sunday, try the dollar store. Paying for coupons can negate your savings.  You can also find coupons online. KCL's data base is a great place to start. There are also P&G coupons that you can bring. Using files or an accordion file is a great way to keep your coupons separated into categories so you can easily find the savings.  How to Use Your Coupons  To start saving, make a list of the items you need to buy. Then go through your coupons and find any that you can use for this list. Pay attention to requirements on the coupon. You may have to buy two, or there may be a certain size you have to buy in order to use the coupon. Also, check the expiration date. Make a note of this on your list so you don't have to go through the coupons and waste time while shopping.  Once you go to the checkout, hand the cashier your stack of coupons and start placing your items on the checkout counter. When the clerk is done, they should scan your coupons and you get to watch your bill go lower and lower! It's the best part.  Use Coupons to Grow Your Savings Account  When the clerk gives you your receipt, you should be able to see the \u201ctotal savings\u201d for that purchase. That is the amount of money you need to transfer to your savings account when you get home. You were going to spend it anyway, so you might as well move that money so that you can save it for something you really want.  It takes a little practice, and you have to get organized and find a system that works best for you, but it will be worth it once you start. '\""}
{"text": " The subscription industry is huge in our world today! The average person spent  $237.33/month on subscription services  in 2018. These services include internet, cell phone coverage, streaming services for video and music, food delivery, health and fitness apps, and more.  With the vast number of subscriptions you can sign up for and the large portion of your monthly budget that they can consume, it's important to keep track of all of your subscriptions. Be sure to cancel or pause any you aren't using to save yourself money.   While there are apps and websites to help you keep track of your subscriptions, sometimes for a fee, I think you can learn a lot by keeping track of them yourself. Not only can you do it for free, it also will give you better insight into what you are spending your money on and whether or not some of your services are worth it. There are two methods that I recommend to my clients when trying to keep track of all their subscriptions in our crazy world.  Build a Subscription Tracking Calendar  The first method is to create a subscription tracking calendar. Using the calendar app on your phone or your computer, create calendar notifications for each of your subscription services. If a subscription is monthly, create a notification each month on the day it is due. In the event name, include the service and the amount. If you don't have the subscription on auto pay, include a reminder a day or two before to be sure that you pay the bill. If the bill is annual, add a notification for the date each year that it renews. Again, add the amount and set a reminder for yourself so you can take the bill into consideration and adjust your budget. Give your subscription reminders all the same color so you can see at a glance when looking at your calendar when they are due.    This method of tracking subscriptions may seem a bit tedious. But if your subscriptions aren't automatically billed to a card or account, or you are finding yourself repeatedly with more month than money, this method can help you find areas to tighten your budget. It can also ensure you don't miss payments.  Create a Subscriptions Spreadsheet  If most of your subscriptions are automatically paid or you don't want to clutter up your calendar, I recommend building a subscriptions spreadsheet. You can do this in whatever spreadsheet software you regularly use. Key pieces of information to include in your spreadsheet are:  what the subscription is how much it costs the frequency that you are billed for it (monthly, quarterly, annually the payment due date what account the bill is paid from if it is paid automatically the web address for managing your subscription and (optionally) your login information  Update your spreadsheet whenever you sign up for a new subscription so that you have accurate information.  This method allows you to keep more information about your subscriptions and to track your spending over time. This can give you insight into your spending habits and allow you to reflect on your different services and how much use you get out of them.  No matter what method you choose, find one that will work for you and that you can maintain. It's also important to remember when trial periods end, and you will start paying for a subscription. This will allow you to cancel the service if you don't find yourself using it. In today's world, subscription services seem to be a fact of life. Developing a strategy for managing them that works for you and that you can maintain is key! '\""}

{"text": "What is your perspective about filing for bankruptcy in regards to saving for retirement?  Submitted by Chris C.  When it comes to any financial decision, everything affects everything. Kudos for thinking about the impact of bankruptcy on retirement planning. The decision to file bankruptcy is a big one, as it will impact your financial life for several years. I recommend checking out  this resource by NOLO Press  (my go-to source when I'm thinking about legal stuff) and consider the following issues:   How far are you away from retirement? If you have 10+ years left, you have more flexibility to pay down your debt and continue saving.  Do you have the financial resources to continue paying your debt  and  stay on track for retirement savings?  If retirement is near, what will your income be? Will it cover your debt payments if you decide not to file for bankruptcy?   All financial decisions are personal and there may not be a \u201cright\u201d answer \u2013 but that doesn't mean you should settle for anything less than the best answer  for your situation . I recommend that you check out the link above and then contact a credit counseling company (my fave is  Consumer Credit Counseling Service of San Francisco ). Talk about the options for debt repayment to make sure you consider all of the possibilities.  Retirement is an exciting time, and there are services and support to help you choose the best option for you. If you haven't already, try this  retirement calculator  to see if you are on track.

{"text": " Unemployment benefits are  taxable income . They are subject to federal and state taxes (if your state taxes income). You can choose to withhold 10% in federal taxes from your benefits by completing a  W-4V  and giving the form to your unemployment office. Some states automatically withhold taxes; some states do not. Go to your state's unemployment website to learn how they handle state taxes. You can also make an  estimated tax payment  to the IRS quarterly. Your state agency will give you a  1099-G  that will report unemployment income and taxes paid on your unemployment income.   Everyone's tax situation is different. But the rule of thumb is to have taxes withheld now, so it's taken out in small chunks. Otherwise, you may have to make a large tax payment next year. '\""}
{"text": " Things in our personal lives are changing at the speed of light right now. Each day there is new information. We are constantly learning how to navigate the changing landscape in which we find ourselves. For many, these changes can include a reduction or complete loss of income and benefits as job hours are reduced or eliminated.  One of the biggest benefits that you may lose is health insurance. Because nearly half of workers in the U.S. get their health insurance coverage through their employer, this can leave you wondering what to do. If your hours are cut or you lose your job entirely, it's important to maintain health insurance. There are several ways to do so.  Option 1: COBRA  If you have recently lost health insurance due to an employment change, one option is to apply for insurance through COBRA. Most employers in the U.S. with 20 or more employees offer COBRA to their employees and their families. The program allows you to extend your employer-sponsored health care for up to 18 months. And you have 60 days after losing coverage to apply for benefits under COBRA.  The one major drawback to COBRA is that it is usually expensive. Normally, with employer provided insurance coverage, the employer pays for a portion (on average around 80%) of the premium. On COBRA, however, you have to pay the entire premium yourself. You will also be responsible for the administrative fees that your employer paid on your behalf. Your employer should notify you of your eligibility for COBRA within 14 days of your job status changing. Then you can elect to have COBRA coverage before your 60-day window expires.  Option 2: Insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)  If maintaining your employer sponsored care through COBRA is cost-prohibitive, you should apply for health insurance on the health insurance exchange. Losing your health benefits is a qualifying event. It will allow you to apply for insurance on the exchange, even if the open enrollment period for the year is closed. Again, with this program, you have 60 days after losing your job to apply for benefits.   Many individuals and families with modified adjusted gross incomes less than 400% of the federal poverty level qualify for a federal subsidy to offset the cost of ACA insurance plans. This would mean $49,960 for a single person and $103,000 for a family of 4 in the continental US. California has added its own subsidies to reduce costs.  To apply for insurance under the ACA, make sure that you are going through the legitimate site. There are several that look similar, but sell non-compliant policies.  Start here  and it may then connect you to your state's health insurance exchange.  When you apply for health insurance through the exchange, you'll need to estimate your income for the calendar year. It can be difficult to do this when unemployed. Take into consideration all anticipated sources of income for yourself and your family members, including unemployment insurance, wages, and alimony.  Be sure to find a policy with benefits that are right for both your health and financial situation. Consider benefits, out-of-pocket costs, and your monthly deductible. Hopefully you can find a coverage option in your price range.  Option 3: Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)  If you expect your household income to be less than 138% of the federal poverty level, you may qualify for Medicaid. Medicaid offers free or low-cost health care. This would be $17,236 for a single person or $38,625 for a family of four. According to the federal government, low-income families, qualified pregnant women and children, and individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income may qualify.  Some states have expanded Medicaid to cover additional groups like:  individuals receiving home and community-based services children in foster care adults with income below a certain threshold  Free or low-cost health care coverage for pregnant women and children in households with slightly higher incomes may be available through your state's Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  How to Get Started  The variety of health insurance options available can be confusing. However, the good news is that you should be able to complete a single application and find out what support is available to you through the  health insurance exchange .  If you're struggling with the application process or understanding your options, you can get an appointment with a  Navigator or Certified Application Counselor affiliated with a local non-profit .  In these uncertain times, it's so important to take care of your own health and the health of your family. Even with job loss and situation changes, there are options to get and maintain health insurance coverage. Take time to research your options and understand the conditions you need to meet. Then find the best-fit coverage for you and your family. You can rest easier knowing that you are covered! '\""}
{"text": " It is important to consider any financial goal, including eliminating debt, in the context of your overall financial well-being. What are your priorities?  What is your financial picture now and in the future?  With a recession comes more uncertainty. What you choose to do will depend on your circumstances. Generally, the foundation for financial health is to get your financial house in order. This is not usually a linear process. It involves:  resolving any pressing financial issues making sure you can cover your essentials (e.g., housing, food, utilities) without going into debt having enough of an emergency fund to cover your living expenses should an emergency arise  Debt is and can feel like a huge burden. When you are in debt, your money is tied up and the debt is costing you interest and probably some stress. Normally, it makes a lot of sense to eliminate your debt as soon as possible. However, during (or pending) a recession, you may want to allocate your resources differently. Now is a good time to focus on stability with your cash flow and security with savings.  Of course, it is prudent to pay your bills in full and on time if you have the means to do so. Stay on track with your debt as best you can. But, now might not be the best time to concentrate on reducing debt due to further financial impacts of COVID-19. Stay in control of your finances during these uncertain times by holding steady with your debt, managing your cash flow, and buffering your savings. '\""}

Fortunately, there are several programs like Habitat For Humanity that can help you build a financial foundation (see what I did there?) and create a path to owning your own home.  There are a few basics steps that anyone seeking to purchase a home must complete. When money is tight and buying a home seems out of reach, a good first step is to learn about the homeownership programs in your immediate area (or in another locale if you are considering moving to a new city or town).  The Housing and Urban Development Office (HUD) has a list of  HUD-sponsored housing counseling services  across the U.S. A HUD housing counselor will be able to tell you about federal and local programs that are available and can often determine your eligibility by asking a few questions about your financial situation and family size.  It is easy to look at all of the steps and become overwhelmed or discouraged, so don't start with a list. Start with a call. Get the information that is relevant to your specific circumstance and learn what you would have to do to achieve your goal. With good planning and the support of a program like Habitat or others, your goal may be closer than you think. '\""}
{"text": " I'm sorry to hear that you lost your job and now must navigate the challenges of Unemployment Insurance. You may encounter busy phone lines, an inability to speak to a live person, and state unemployment website issues. This will depend on what state you live in and when you filed. Presently over 42 million are out of work and seeking unemployment, which exacerbates these problems.  Pandemic Unemployment Insurance (PUI) will likely replace most or all your earnings temporarily. However, it might take a month or more for funds to arrive. If you have become unemployed, I recommend that you immediately apply for Unemployment Insurance. Apply for the existing Regular Unemployment Insurance (UI) program, New Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, and the New Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program (an extra $600 per month under the CARES Act). Depending on your state, these program applications may be bundled together into a single application or separate. Either way, you apply for all of them via your state's UI Agency. Find your state's UI Agency at  this website .  It will likely take at least three weeks after your application is approved for your first payment to arrive. So apply in the first week that you are without work or have had your hours cut. Because of the many and significant changes to UI, you should forget what you thought you knew about the program.  Even if you have never qualified for UI before or think you are not going to qualify, go ahead and apply. '\""}
{"text": " A sinking fund is a way for corporations to put aside money at specific intervals in order to pay a bond or a debt that will be due at a later date.  You can use this same strategy to achieve your goals or pay for expenses that aren't due on a monthly basis. By planning and putting away a little bit each paycheck, big expenses can be less of a burden.    Let's say you pay your car insurance every six months, and that bill is $600 each time. Based on when the bill is due, you can figure out how long you have to save the full amount. For our example, let's say you have six months.    To calculate how much to save, take the total due and divide it by the number of months you have. In our example it's $600 divided by 6 which equals $100 per month. You would put your \u201csinking fund\u201d requirement right on your monthly budget for $100. Or if you're paid twice a month, you can even break it down further to $50 per paycheck.  I suggest moving the money for your sinking fund out of your checking account and into a savings account. Out of sight and out of mind! This can prevent you from spending the money on other things. Then, when the bill arrives, simply transfer the money back into your checking account and pay the bill.  The next month, start adding back to the sinking fund for the next time your insurance is due. '\""}
{"text": " My husband and I want to buy a house for first-time buyers. How can we fix our credit?  Submitted by Ferlenzia M.  Owning a home is a dream that many people have. To make that dream a reality, most people get a mortgage loan. To qualify for that type of loan, you need steady income, savings for upfront costs, low debt, and \u201cgood\u201d credit. The minimum credit score depends on the type of loan you are getting. For example, a conventional loan requires a credit score of least 620. Alternatively, a government-backed FHA loan allows for a minimum credit score of 580. Both types of loans are offered by most lenders.  If your credit score doesn't meet the threshold for the type of loan you are seeking, the first thing you should know is that raising your credit score takes time and a history of on-time payments \u2013 of at least six months.   Below are some tips for building your credit score:  Correct any inaccurate information  If you find a mistake on your credit report, follow the instructions provided to fix the mistake.  Pay bills on time  Your payment history, or track record of paying your bills on time, is the most significant factor of your credit score. Commit to making on-time payments by preparing and following a realistic spending plan and setting up bill payments systems that work for you.  Minimize outstanding debt  How much you owe is also an important factor of your credit score. Your debt load affects your ability to borrow and how much you can borrow. Keep your debt manageable by borrowing cautiously and keeping balances low on credit cards. If you have existing debt, make a plan to pay it off or down.  Re-establish credit  If you have had problems paying your bills on time, get and stay current on past due accounts. Open new accounts strategically and pay them on time to raise your score over the long term. Your options include:  A secured loan or credit card , where your savings acts as collateral if you do not make your payments. If you are considering a secured credit card, look for one with limited uses and a low interest rate. A loan with a co-signer  \u2013 someone who agrees to be responsible for the payments if you do not make them.  Whichever way you choose to re-establish your credit, it is critical that you make your payments in full and on time. With time and focused attention, you can get your credit score where it needs to be to realize your dream of homeownership. '\""}

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has a helpful website dedicated to helping you understand what  tax credits you may be eligible for and how to claim them . Did you earn less in 2020 than 2019? You could qualify for a bigger tax refund! Congress approved a new \u2018lookback rule' which means you can use either your 2019 or 2020 income on your taxes to get the biggest refund possible this year. Make sure you have your 2019 tax return available when you do your taxes this year. Read more about EITC , including some important changes this year and how your EITC may be impacted if you received unemployment benefits.  File Your Taxes to Receive Past Stimulus Payments  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal government has sent out two rounds of stimulus checks. If you should have been eligible but didn't receive either or both of the payments, the only way to get that money is by filing your taxes.   Have you received your stimulus payment as a debit card or check in the mail? If not, use the IRS's  Get My Payment tool  to check your status. If you didn't receive the full stimulus amount from either or both of the stimulus payments, it's not too late! You may be eligible for the  Recovery Rebate Credit . The stimulus payments were based on your 2019 income, so if you faced a loss in income in 2020, if you were newly independent in 2020, or if you had additional dependents in 2020, you may receive additional money when you file your 2020 tax return.

{"text": " It's difficult to create a solid financial plan when the economy is booming. Add an economic downturn and creating a financial plan can seem impossible. Here are eight tips for financial planning during a downturn that can help you stay the course.  1. Be Sure You're Thinking Clearly  It's easy to give in to panic during a downturn. In order to make good decisions though,  you need to think clearly . Give yourself a cooling off period before you make decisions to be sure you're making them with a level head. Wait a day or talk your worries over with someone. Just be sure when you make a decision you are coming from a place of logic and information, not a place of emotion.  2. Get Everyone on the Same Page  Take some time to  get your family on the same page about your finances . What are your short-term goals and priorities? What are you working towards in the long-term? If everyone knows the end goal, making small changes during a downturn can be less difficult.  3. Create A Bare-Bones Budget  A key step towards successful financial planning, no matter what the economy is doing, is knowing exactly how much you need to get by. A bare-bones budget can help. A bare-bones budget covers all of your needs. Once you know how much  your needs  cost, you can add back in wants if there is money left over. Having this lower limit will help you see exactly what your expenses are and how you can cover them. Listing out your expenses can also help you find ways to cut back if needed.  4. Re-Evaluate Your Priorities  As the economy changes, sometimes our goals and priorities have to change too. It is okay during a downturn to prioritize meeting your necessary expenses and paying down debt over other financial goals. Shifting money to these two areas can help you have peace of mind knowing your bills are covered. It can also help you save money by  paying down debts  so they will accrue less interest. Paying your debts can also free up money in the budget for other goals as you pay them off.  5. Take Advantage of Dollar Cost Averaging  Dollar cost averaging is an investing philosophy where you invest the same amount of money into a stock or fund at set intervals (monthly, semi-annually, or annually). It is nearly impossible to actually time the market and buy low and sell high. Staying consistent with dollar cost averaging allows you to buy more shares when the price is low and while you buy less when the price is high. This helps remove some of the variability of the market.    6. Think Long-Term  It can be hard during an economic downturn to plan for the future. When things feel so uncertain, the tendency can be to shut down. This is when it is helpful to remember long-term trends. The economy won't always be in a downturn and when things turn around, having plans in place to get where you want to go will be helpful. So be sure to keep the big picture in mind!  7. Stay Organized  It is always important to keep your financial life organized. But this is doubly important during an economic downturn. Knowing when money is coming in and when you have to pay bills is crucial to sticking to your budget. Track your income and expenses in a way that makes sense to you. But know where everything is and when it is due! Some tracking methods I've seen work well for people are budgeting apps or Excel or Google Sheets. If there are multiple people in your household managing money, I recommend a tracking method you can share to help you stay organized.  8. Never Stop Learning  One big thing you can do during a downturn, or anytime, to help your financial plan stay strong is to always keep learning. The more you know about personal finance and financial planning the better prepared you will be in good times and in bad. To keep the cost low for learning, check out personal finance books from your local library, listen to podcasts, or find blogs to read.    Even though it is hard during a downturn, you can still make a financial plan and work to stick to it. Stay calm and remember that progress comes from small actions repeated over time! '\""}
{"text": " I'm sorry to hear you are unemployed. I know for many people it has been very difficult to access unemployment benefits since the CARES Act was enacted in March 2020. On top of that, the extra $600 per month payout ended July 31, 2020. So, congratulations on breaking through the red tape. You finally have the money in your hands that you needed to pay your bills and possibly build some savings.   Whenever you have income and you want to control where your money is going, I recommend a financial plan. Set goals that are SMART: Specific Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-specific. To help achieve your smart goal(s) create a spending plan to understand what you have coming in (income) and going out (expenses). Pay yourself first at least 10% of the income and put it into building emergency savings. If you have more of a surplus after meeting your financial obligations, save even more. By using this method, you can meet your current monthly obligations and save for the future.  Hopefully, you can continue this strategy once you are re-employed sometime soon. I wish you nothing but the best in the future. '\""}
{"text": " As a parent, you want to do everything you can to set your child up for success.\\\\xa0And lately, the importance of helping them understand personal finance has become clear.\\\\xa0While you work with them on saving and living within their means, you may also want to talk to them about credit.\\\\xa0      You may even want to help them start  establishing good credit , which is a  cornerstone for financial independence .\\\\xa0One way that you can help your child establish credit is by adding them as an authorized user to one of your credit cards.\\\\xa0But before you add your child as an authorized user, it is important to understand what it means and how it will affect their credit and yours.  What Is an Authorized User on a Credit Card?  When you make someone an authorized user on your credit card, you are giving them the ability to charge things to your account.\\\\xa0They will get their own card in their name.\\\\xa0But all of the charges they make will be applied to your account, and you will be responsible for paying them.\\\\xa0It is important to understand that any charges your child makes on the card will ultimately be your responsibility.  Benefits of Making Your Child an Authorized User on Your Credit Card  Adding your child as an authorized user to your credit card can help them in several ways.\\\\xa0First, it can help them establish a credit history.\\\\xa0 Because the card is in their name, they will start building a credit file.\\\\xa0This helps them because it lengthens their credit history, which makes up 15% of their FICO credit score.\\\\xa0The age at which you can make your child an authorized user varies by card.\\\\xa0But it will be difficult for your child to get a credit card on their own until they are 21 (some cards can be obtained at 18 but with stricter application requirements).\\\\xa0Adding your child as an authorized user before they are 21 will give them a longer credit history.  Another benefit of adding your child to your credit card is that gives them a chance to learn more about credit.\\\\xa0You can teach them firsthand about responsible credit usage, never charging more than you can pay off, and always paying on time.\\\\xa0Teaching them these necessary lessons will help them maintain a better credit score throughout their life.  Drawbacks and Risks of Adding Your Child as an Authorized User on Your Credit Card  There are a few things to keep in mind when adding your child to your credit card as an authorized user.\\\\xa0First, it is important to remember that every charge they make is ultimately your responsibility.\\\\xa0Have conversations about credit limits and help them be aware of what they are spending.\\\\xa0Some parents add their child as an authorized user with the understanding their child will only charge gas, transportation, emergencies, or other certain expenses.  If you are adding them to your card to help them build their credit score, make sure that the card reports authorized users to the credit bureaus.\\\\xa0If they don't, having your child as an authorized user won't impact their credit score.\\\\xa0Your card's reporting policy should be included in their policy statement.  What your child does as an authorized user on the account will affect your credit score, and what you do will affect theirs.\\\\xa0So, if you're carrying a balance on the card due to either party's spending, both credit scores could suffer as a result.\\\\xa0This is because you will be using more of your available credit, causing your credit utilization ratio to be higher.  Final Thoughts on Authorized Users  Adding your child as an authorized user to your credit card is a good way to help them start to understand credit and build both credit and financial responsibility.\\\\xa0But it is important to remember that all charges they make, whether you approved them or not, are ultimately your responsibility to pay off.\\\\xa0If you decide to add them to your account, make sure that you also help them understand credit and learn to use it responsibly.\\\\xa0Having a good credit score is helpful in the real world and adding your child as an authorized user can help them on their path.

{"text": " Do you recommend credit consolidation to improve scores and decrease debt?  Submitted by Natasha P.  There are two parts to this question, so let's dig into them separately.  Improving Your Credit Score  Whenever a financial institution pulls your credit with the purpose of offering you a loan, your score may be affected. Closing a credit line, especially a well-established line, can also impact your score.  If you are consolidating a lot of credit cards or other debt into one or a couple of lines it can become more manageable and easier to not miss a payment, possibly improving your score. However, you could end up with a higher interest rate and the terms of consolidation often require you to close the other accounts. You can see that there are several things to consider.  Decreasing Your Debt  As for consolidating debt to decrease debt, consolidation doesn't make the amount you owe disappear. It may make it more manageable to pay off depending on your budget, interest rate, and what your monthly payment would be. I'd first take a look at your spending habits, create a budget, and see where you could possibly bring in more money to help pay off the debt. If the habits that got you into racking up this debt are still in place, you'd be hard-pressed to see much change with or without debt consolidation.  If you do decide to consolidate debt, you'll want to take three factors into consideration:  What is your primary objective?  Do you want to lower your interest rates overall, lower your monthly payments, or minimize the number of open accounts? Of course, the lower the rate, the less money you will pay in interest over the life of the loan. Most loans with collateral (ex. car, house, or savings account) will have a lower interest rate than unsecured loans. How much can you pay per month?  The more you can afford, the quicker the loan is paid, and less interest will accrue. What is your time frame to get out of debt?  By reorganizing debt and changing the type of debt and how much you owe per month, you can free up funds in your budget to pay off all of your debts quicker and maybe even jumpstart your savings.  Every situation is unique and debt consolidation is not always the right choice. Credit unions are my favorite resource for consolidation loans. By evaluating your current spending habits and considering the three questions mentioned above, you can come to the decision that will be best for you. '\""}
{"text": " When life happens and there's a big bill attached, we often scramble to figure out how to pay it. Ideally, an unexpected expense should be covered by your emergency savings account. If you don't have enough  savings, consider asking for a payment plan or delaying the bill until you get a tax return or bonus.  If those options don't work, as a last resort, you may be able to use your 401k plan. It's considered a last resort because the purpose of a 401k  is to save money you may need when you're older and possibly unable to work. There are two options to taking money out of a 401k while you are working: a hardship withdrawal or a 401k plan loan.  401k Hardship Withdrawals  You take money out of your 401k plan for a specific  IRS-approved hardship  (prevention of eviction, education expenses, etc.) and you're not returning the funds. Here are a few details you should be aware of:  With few exceptions, the amount you withdraw is taxed. You may also owe a 10% penalty if you remove the money before you are 59 \u00bd years of age. The amount withdrawn is restricted to what you need to cover the hardship. You will need documentation to prove your hardship and hardship amount. Many employers will not allow you to contribute to a 401k plan for about six months after your withdrawal. If you choose a 401k hardship withdrawal, you can have additional taxes taken out of the amount received. However, many find they still owe taxes or get a much smaller (or no) refund. Talk to a tax professional to make sure you withhold the correct amount of taxes. If you take out a 401k plan loan, your take-home pay will be less because the loan payments come directly out of your paycheck. Adjust your spending to account for the lower paycheck.   401k Loans  You borrow against your 401k plan and paying an interest rate given to you by your employer. The payments typically last 1-5 years. If you are using the money to buy a home, you may be able to take longer to pay. You pay yourself back through monthly payroll deductions.    Because it's a loan, you typically do not owe taxes, as long as you are making the payments. Some companies may restrict how much you can take out and how often you can request a 401k loan. Contact your 401k plan for more information. If you leave your job, your company may require you to pay the remaining loan balance back in full within a specific time frame. If you do not pay the money back or roll it over within a particular time frame, the remaining loan amount is typically taxable. You may also have to pay a 10% penalty on the remaining balance if you are under 59 \u00bd.  To avoid having to use your 401k plan for emergencies, open a savings account and start with an amount you can easily save (ideally through payroll deductions). If you get a 401k plan loan, once the loan payments end, consider having the former loan amount automatically deducted from your payroll into a savings account. These steps will go a long way into turning an unexpected expense from a crisis to a minor inconvenience. '\""}

{"text": " The last partof my morning routine goes like this:   Get in the car. Open Pandora (the free version, of course). Select the Nelly & St. Lunatics channel.  Open the Waze app. Select location labeled as Work.  Back out of my driveway; I'm on the way!  You might think that it's silly for me to use a navigation or GPS app to get to work every day. You may be wondering if I even know my way around where I live! A GPS app helps me overcome issues that arise while en route: traffic building up, accidents, flooding, or objects in the road. It alerts me to problems that are arising and suggests a different route if needed. It doesn't change the location I travel to, but it helps me adapt my path so that I arrive more quickly.  Your budget or your spending plan is your financial GPS .  What's Your Location?  In your budget, the location you're traveling toward is your  financial goal . Take the time to soul search and figure out what resonates for you. In my experience as an Accredited Financial Counselor, not having established goals is the biggest mistake I've seen when it comes to budgeting. Goals are motivational and exciting. They help keep you on track. Without goals, it's very difficult to follow your plan because you don't have anything set that you're working toward. Without financial goals, it's like taking a drive with nowhere to go.  You budget to reach the goals that are important to you. You budget so you have less stress, build memories on a family vacation, and spend time with your children when you buy an ice cream cone once a month. Every single one of those goals is important not only to you but to your family. This is what you're traveling toward in your budget and is the location you arrive at.  What's Your Route?  The route you travel is the budget or spending plan itself. When traffic is building up, a GPS helps to send you a slightly different path. In other words, your budget adapts to your circumstances. In order to be as effective as possible, these updates need to happen in real time. Your budget is something you need to revisit and revise regularly.  When you're first building your budget, you want to get as specific as possible to flesh out the details. Make a list of all of the bills you have to pay on a monthly basis. You and I both know that you have many more expenses to cover, so doing this only gets you part of the way there. What else do you pay for?  It's very difficult to fully understand where your money is going without looking in the past. Look over your bank, credit card, and payment apps (such as CashApp, Venmo, and PayPal) over a set period of time. Since we're in the month of May right now, I'd suggest looking at April 1 through April 30. Add up your variable expenses within categories \u2014 these are the expenses that fluctuate from month to month. Groceries, dining out, gas, and entertainment are some examples of variable expense categories. Repeat for at least one other month, for example, March 1 through 31. Create an average by adding the category totals and dividing by the number of months used in the spending review.   Here's an example of how you'd figure out your average monthly spending on groceries:  April groceries = $753.20 March groceries = $748.50 February groceries = $588.10 Grocery total for three months = $2,089.80 Average grocery cost (divide total cost by three) = $696.60  Now you need to ask yourself some questions.   Which of these need to stay the same? What categories cause you discomfort when you look at the numbers? Do you want to change those categories? What changes can you reasonably make given your family's needs and activities? Gas is a difficult variable expense to change in most cases because you need to get to work, drop your children off at daycare, and run other errands essential for your household. Other categories might make sense to change, though. Dining out and entertainment are often categories that can be trimmed back.  What expenses do you cover over the year? Back to school, holidays, birthdays, and property taxes are some of the big ones that come to my mind. It's wise to prepare over time; think of what your game plan will be in your budget. Some of these may even be the financial goals you're working toward. Remember, this is the location you're traveling toward, so allocating some of your income for these goals is key.  Do You Need to Reroute Your Path?  When there's an unexpected expense or change in income, sometimes our budget has to reroute us just as a GPS would guide us around a traffic build-up. It's okay if you can't save the $100 you planned this month because you can use your budget to save $25 extra over the next 4 months to make up for lost ground. The ability to change routes is the great part about using a budget!   You're still travelingto work, but you might use a different highway. Only now, you're not stuck inthat traffic jam for an hour; you're arriving on time. You might adapt a couplemonths of your budget, but you're still able build a sandcastle at the lakewith your daughter on your family vacation. '\""}
{"text": " It would be nice if we could have a simpler way to meet our tax obligations. But this is the system we have, and unfortunately errors are quite common. Let's review some common errors that you should look out for.  1. Data Entry Errors  The IRS provides a  list of common errors . The most common issue is data entry errors, such as:  inputting the wrong social security number entering incorrect W-2 info spelling a name wrong  Some of these will be rejected immediately if you're filing electronically. Some won't. If it passes through the initial screening, maybe your return will never be right, or maybe it will be flagged later. This can take weeks or months to fix. Perhaps the worst of the data entry errors is to put the wrong bank account number for a direct deposit. So be attentive when entering data into your tax software!  2. Choosing the Wrong Filing Status  The five filing statuses are:  Single Head of Household Qualifying Widow(er) Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately  Filing correctly ensures you aren't making a mistake that may cost thousands of dollars. There are cases when someone can be married and file as Head of Household, but the requirements are very specific. If you're married and don't meet those requirements, you must file either Married Filing Jointly or Married Filing Separate.  3. Incorrect Deductions  A friend may tell you that you can deduct something, and either you or they misunderstand the deduction. But somehow you make it fit into the tax software.  I had a client who deducted her car purchase ($27,000) as an itemized deduction because someone told her she could. She wasn't self employed or a business owner. There is a case that  if  you itemize and  if  you claim sales tax as a deduction instead of income taxes paid that you  may  be able to add the sales taxes paid for a car purchase to your sales tax deduction. That is two \u201cifs\u201d and a \u201cmay,\u201d and even so, it isn't the whole car purchase. My client owed the IRS over $2,000, plus penalties and interest. If a deduction sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If you don't understand the questions the software is asking or it doesn't look right, then it's time to  look for professional help .   4. Mistakenly Claiming or Not Claiming a Dependent  This one can be complicated. It comes up often when parents aren't married. But there are many other situations that involve this error as well. Read more about  when you can claim someone as a dependent . For more help, check out the IRS's  Interactive Tax Assistant .  I've covered four common types of errors, but there are many more possible errors. You can avoid them by making sure you or your tax professional are focused and careful in your tax return preparation.  '\""}
{"text": "Mo' money, mo' problems?  It's one thing for The Notorious B.I.G. to say, but if you're experiencing financial stress in your daily life, you're not likely to agree. When you feel like you can't make ends meet, it may seem like money is the cause of (and solution to) all your challenges.  Here are a few things you can do when money has you stressed out:  1. Stop and Breathe  I know breathing seems like a no-brainer, but think about how often you find yourself holding your breath when you're feeling stressed out. Attempting to find your way forward when you are feeling overwhelmed may actually hinder your progress. Developing a  healthier response to stress  can help you manage financial anxiety and more accurately assess your options.  2. Be Mindful  Notice when stress has a grip on you and increase activities that soothe or calm you. Meditation, playing music, or talking with trusted friends can give you the mental space and encouragement to treat yourself kindly. Think about how you would respond to a loved one who was struggling with money, and show yourself that same kindness. As always, there's an app for that, so if you need some support, check out  mindfulness apps  for your computer or phone.  3. Focus on the Future  Recognize that financial challenges are generally a combination of internal (things you can do) and external (economic or environmental) events. So place your attention on what you CAN control. Abusing yourself with thoughts of what you \u201cshoulda, woulda, coulda\u201d done is just a recipe for more anxiety. Remember the \u201cno shame zone\u201d and be gentle with yourself as you identify what actions you want to take.  Financial distress is one of the most common stressors, so learning how to deal with the stress is often the first step to finding your way to financial wellness. '\""}
{"text": "\u201cHi, I just completed a chapter 13 bankruptcy and would like to know if I can apply for a personal loan. Thank you.\u201d  Submitted by David N.  Thanks for your question about life (and credit) after bankruptcy. This is a common situation and the good news is that getting  Chapter 13 debt relief  is not fatal for your financial future.  Is a personal loan the right choice?  If you are planning to obtain a personal loan, consider the following before applying:   What's the point? What will getting the loan do for your situation? Will it help you pay higher interest debt? Do you need it to pay living expenses or other financial goals?  How will you manage the additional financial responsibility of the personal loan?  Are there other options? Can you increase your income, lower your expenses, or a combination of the two?  How will applying for a loan impact your credit score?   Applying for a personal loan  If you feel confident that getting a loan is the right financial choice, consider the following:   Be proactive \u2013 get your credit report so you know what the potential lender will see.  Create a budget based on your current situation so you know exactly what you can repay. You likely did this step during the Chapter 13 process. Has anything changed since then?  Shop around and consider all of your potential lenders:  Credit unions (they tend to be more willing to look at your entire situation, not just the bankruptcy)  Online peer lenders  Avoid predatory lenders    What interest rates are being offered?  Are the repayments (of the new loan) manageable considering your Chapter 13 repayment plan?  What time frame is best for repayment? How will that impact your other financial goals?   Getting a personal loan is not a substitute for building a money management strategy to stabilize your financial situation. But if it can help you reduce the \u201ccost of money\u201d by lowering the interest rate on existing debt, it may be a good move. '\""}

Does that feel right? Could you make changes to your earning and spending habits to set more money aside?  Consider your overall financial picture  If you have a significant amount of debt, are having trouble making ends meet, or are in the middle of a financial crisis, taking care of those situations should take precedence over saving for future goals. Once your financial situation has stabilized, think about starting to save for an emergency fund to provide a safety net if your car breaks down or you lose your job.

{"text": "If you need money for the short or long term, it's important to remember that not all loans are created equal \u2013 and the price you pay for that money (in fees and interest) may vary dramatically.  What do you need?  Before shopping around for loans, you should know how much money you're looking to borrow! You'll want to make sure you're only borrowing what you need. If you're clear on how much you actually need, you won't feel as tempted to accept an offer that is beyond your needs.  I learned this the hard way. When I was in college, I was approved for a loan that was much larger than I needed to pay my expenses. The idea of all that extra money was so enticing that I didn't think about the long-term impacts of taking more money than I needed. But those loans haunted me during repayment. Ultimately, I had to remember the \u201cno shame zone\u201d and forgive myself.  Before  you apply for a loan, consider how much time you'll need to repay the loan as well as well as what your repayment plan will be.  What's your credit score?  When you apply for a loan, the lender will run a credit check. But if you know your score ahead of time, you'll know what to expect going in to the conversation. If you know that your credit score is low, consider improving your credit before applying so that you can get a lower interest rate. This might be tough if you need the money soon, but talk to a  reputable credit counselor  to learn about your options.  If your credit score isn't as high as you'd like it to be, you could ask someone to cosign the loan with you to get a better rate. Check that the person cosigning your loan has a better credit score than yours, and make sure you don't make any late payments, because that will harm your cosigner.  What are your options?  I recommend getting multiple loan offers so that you can compare the terms and make sure you're getting the best deal. But beware! Shopping around for a loan can impact your credit. The good news is that  FICO Scores  understand that people may request loans from multiple companies even if they're only looking for one. FICO will ignore mortgage, auto, and student loan inquiries made in the 30 days prior to scoring.  Once you have multiple options,  evaluate them  based on the terms, interest rates, payments, and the  total  interest that you'll pay over the course of the loan. Many lenders will try to get you to focus on the payment. That is certainly a factor you should consider, but it's not the most important factor.  Where are your limits?  Be honest with yourself. If you don't have a budget already, work out how you will handle the payments and make sure you know how you'll fit this new debt into your financial plan. '\""}
{"text": " Submitted by Sara K.  A Debt Management Plan (DMP) that is offered by a non-profit credit counseling agency can be an excellent tool for getting out of debt. Anyone can use these plans, whether they have poor credit or great credit. Credit cards, collections, and medical debt are eligible for these programs.  How a Debt Management Plan works  Every month, you make a payment to the agency, and then the agency in turn sends a payment to each of your creditors. That means that every 30 days, the creditor is getting a payment.  Because you are working with a DMP and not going to a debt settlement company or filing for bankruptcy, your creditors are motivated to work with you. Often, they will either lower the monthly payment they are requesting, lower the interest rate, or both! Each creditor tells the plan what they are willing to do.  You are paying back the full amount of principal, but with a lowered interest rate. That makes it easier to tackle this debt much more quickly. By law, each credit card must be paid in full in 60 months.  How a Debt Management Plan can affect your credit  The DMP does not report to the three major credit bureaus. However,  because the debt remains with your creditors, they continue to report the payment every 30 days. This can build your credit history.    If you are already behind when you come into the plan, some of the creditors will even age up the account once they have received two to four payments. This is basically a fresh start, as they will no longer report you as late. If the card isn't eligible for a re-age, you are encouraged to slowly make up the past due amount by paying a little extra each month. The late fees stop when your credit card is enrolled in the program, so paying $10-$20 month will make a difference.   Your credit cards will be closed when they go into the plan. You might see a small dip in your credit score because of this. But because you are continuing to make a monthly payment you can afford, you are building a great credit history. And because the interest rate is lower and you're paying back so much more of the amount you borrowed, your credit score will most likely rebound and improve. Payment history and amount owed make up 65% of the calculation for your credit score. A DMP helps in both of these areas.  How much does a Debt Management Plan cost?  There is a small fee associated with plan. The state you live in will determine that fee. These plans are administered by non-profit agencies, but they do have to keep the lights on! The savings of interest on the credit cards will likely cover the cost. Plus, the counselor you work with will be able to disclose this information to you before you enter the program.  If you're interested, find a  non-profit Debt Management Plan administrator in your area .    '\""}
{"text": "We've heard so much great feedback from the SaverLife Community on money hacks they use to stretch their dollars and meet their savings goals.  Let's take a look at some of the top money-saving strategies that Savers have shared:  1. Negotiating with Bill Companies  \u201cFor our medical bills, we got payments reduced by hospital and have monthly payment plans. I always call the company when I can't pay a full bill, I work with them.\u201d  Credit cards companies and other creditors want to get paid and keep you as a customer, so it is in their best interest to negotiate with you \u2013 but they won't do it if you don't ask!  Brush up on your negotiation strategies  before you contact them, take a look at your budget, and only offer what you can reasonably pay. Once the hardship passes, revisit your budget and revise your payment plans to reduce the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan.  2. Collecting Unemployment  \u201cI collect unemployment while I'm on break. I pay minimum balances on things and pay it back later.\u201d  I have coached many people who are uncomfortable about applying for public benefits. Social supports like unemployment and food and rental assistance exist to help you through hard times. If you are facing financial challenges, check into\\\\xa0 eligibility for benefits \\\\xa0to help you get back on track.  3. Taking It One Day at a Time  \u201cI take it one day at a time. I like being creative. I try to figure it out because I always have in the past.\u201d  Great advice! A mindful approach to dealing with a shortfall may reveal options you overlook if you react to the emotions or try to tackle everything at once. If you have options other than your savings that is great, but if using your savings is the best choice to deal with the situation, do what you must and rebuild when you are financially stable again.  4. Doing Odd Jobs  \u201cWe're always getting by. We haven't lost anything but we struggle sometimes. We do other odd jobs, brainstorm how to help each other open our own businesses. Soon my son will be in 1st grade, so I could get a full-time job.

Relying on Support Networks and Savings  \u201cIn a low period of income, we count on my girls or borrow from my parents. In a high period, we set aside money as savings.\u201d  Family\\\\xa0or community support is often the best way to handle a short-term cash flow problem.

{"text": "    When you are working hard to build your credit score, it's important to do things that will help your score go up. But it's equally important to understand what will hurt your score. When you understand what can hurt your credit score, you can change your behavior and take steps to avoid certain actions so that your score continues to grow. Here are four things that can hurt your credit score. Keep these in mind as you manage your money.  1. Paying Late or Missing Payments  Your payment history makes up 35% of your FICO credit score. Making your payments late or missing payments altogether will hurt your credit score. This factor is the largest single portion of your credit score, so each payment you make or miss can have a big impact. Missing your payments also signals to lenders that you are a risky borrower and might have more debt than you can manage.  To avoid missing and late payments that drag down your score, be sure to only put charges on your credit card that you can pay off. Also, do not borrow money unless you can make the payments. If something happens and you are unable to make a payment on time, reach out to your lender or creditor. They may be able to adjust your due date so you can pay on time and maintain your credit score.  2. Using Too Much of Your Credit  Your credit usage accounts for 30% of your FICO score and using too much of your available credit can hurt your score. Creditors look at your credit utilization ratio, or how much of your credit that you are using compared to how much credit you have, to determine if you are a risky borrower. Ideally, creditors want to see you use less than 30% of your available credit.  To keep your credit usage from negatively impacting your credit score, aim to use less than 30% of your available credit. So, if you have two credit cards, each with a $500 limit, you have a total available credit of $1,000. Do your best to keep your total usage below $300 to keep your credit usage from hurting your credit score.  3. Opening Too Many New Accounts  Another thing that can lower your credit score is opening too many new accounts in a short period of time. New accounts make up 10% of your FICO credit score. Opening too many accounts at once causes lenders to worry that you may be taking on too much debt and causes your score to drop.  Instead of opening several accounts all at once, just open new accounts when you actually need them. And be sure that you have a plan in place to make your payments. This will help keep your credit score higher.  4. Closing Credit Cards  While it may seem counterintuitive, closing credit card accounts can actually hurt your credit score. Fifteen percent of your FICO credit score comes from your length of credit history. If you close your older credit cards because you aren't using them anymore, this actually shortens the length of your credit history, and hurts your score. Closing a credit card also decreases your available credit, which can in turn increase the percentage of your total credit you use.  Remember, you want to keep your credit usage under 30%, so closing a card can hurt your credit score in this area as well.  Instead of closing a credit card, just don't use it. You can put it in a drawer or another safe place and hold on to it. This will keep your credit history length intact and also will not increase your credit utilization ratio. This will help keep your credit score up.  Managing Your Credit Score  It's important to understand what can hurt your credit score and how you can protect yourself. By paying your bills on time, managing how much credit you use and how many accounts you open, and by keeping your cards open even if you don't use them, you will be well on your way to building good credit. Credit is a great tool to have on your personal finance journey. And using your credit responsibly can help you as you work towards your financial goals.

{"text": " I've worked hard to get my credit score into the excellent range using only one credit card .  I pay monthly before the due date. Why do credit sites like Credit Karma and Credit Sesame keep suggesting I get another credit card to improve my score even more? What is the impact on a credit score when applying for a new card?  Submitted by Rick D.  Congratulations! You have very positive habits around your credit and debt management. I'm impressed that you pay your bills on time, and many times ahead of the due date. Plus, you only have one credit card and you pay it off every month.  You have maintained excellent credit history (35% of the credit score) and a low credit card utilization rate* (30% of your credit score). Clearly this is sufficient to maintain a high credit score. Length of credit makes up another 15% of your score. Plus, types of credit and inquiries represent 10% of the score each. If you apply for credit, it's possible that your credit score may dip if you have too many inquiries in the last two years. (Two years is the most inquiries can stay on your credit report by law.)  Don't feel pressured to apply for credit if you don't need it. Most lenders advertise to get more loans out to build their loan portfolios. They often use sites like Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, and others to market their loan products. When I was a loan manager at a credit union, my job was to find platforms to sell our loan products. However, it appears your credit and debt are under control. As you indicated, you work hard to maintain that control. So I advise you to continue practicing positive financial behavior and habits!  *Credit utilization rate is the amount of money you owe divided by your total credit limit for those credit cards. Example: You owe $30 and you have a $100 credit limit. That equals a 30% utilization rate. '\""}

{"text": " I own a home that I bought only two years ago. In five years, I would like to relocate to Nevada. I'd like to rent out my existing home to have some net income, but I also would like to purchase another home in Nevada. I have no savings for a down payment for the new home. What would be my best option?  Submitted by Lisa C.  Congratulations on thinking ahead to your future goals and building the wealth to achieve them! Five years is a great timeline to set up a S.M.A.R.T goal.  What is a SMART Goal?  Those letters stand for: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound. Use this as a guide to planning out your goal:  What do you specifically want to do? How will you measure that you're doing it? Is this goal achievable and realistic for where you are currently? Will you be able to achieve it in the time frame you want?  Crunch the Numbers  Start by doing a little research to figure out how much you may need for a down payment on a new home.  Take the amount you want to save for a down payment and divide it by 5. This will give you an amount to save each year. Then take that amount and divide by 12. This will give you an amount to save each month.  Determine if you can realistically save this amount each month to help cover the down payment. If the amount is too high, start thinking of creative ways to earn extra money so you can reach your goal. Or, set a price range for the future home that gives you flexibility in how much to save.  Research the Rental Market  Next, research to find out if the current rental market will bring enough revenue to cover the mortgage payment on your current home. If so, you may want to rent it now for six months to a year to see if you really want to be a landlord. Being a landlord has its pros and cons. Having a \u201clandlord\u201d experience before you move could help you decide if you want to be a long-distance landlord.  Finally, over the next five years, watch the housing market in Nevada and the rental market in your current area to see how the prices fluctuate and determine how any changes will affect your plan.

{"text": "What gets in the way of accomplishing financial goals?  Picture this : you're chugging right along making all the right moves to achieve your financial goals then\u2026 BAM! Something happens (A car accident? A root canal?) and you must come up with some cash to deal with it. You need  emergency savings  to handle unexpected situations and expenses. Otherwise, a little problem can turn into a big setback.  How much do I need in my emergency fund?  Don't know how much should be in your emergency fund? That's okay. Start with a simple solution (that is sure to help you sleep better at night).  Our friends at Nerdwallet have an  easy calculator  to help you figure out a target emergency fund based on your monthly expenses. Now, if that amount makes you scream and toss your computer across the room (don't do that), you can always start with this approach: add up the amount of all your insurance deductibles (medical, car, renters/homeowners) and set that as your baseline for your emergency savings account. Having the money to cover your deductibles means that, in the event of a serious emergency like a car accident or injury, you can cover the deductible without going into debt.  Being able to cover your deductibles is a great start. With this approach, you'll be able to deal with the most common financial emergencies. An emergency fund of just $500 will help you feel more prepared and less panicked if an emergency hits. '\""}
{"text": " How much should I save monthly if I am in debt? Or what percentage of my income should I save if I am in debt?  Submitted by LaTisha V.  When we have debt, our priorities can change completely.  To start, we have to remember that not paying our debt will negatively impact our credit history and therefore take away other opportunities in the future.  In your situation, your income not only needs to cover your basic needs, but also your monthly debt payments. This means your savings capability will be reduced. However, this does  not  mean that it totally disappears. Saving is (almost always) possible.  Let's start with the fact that there is no such thing as an ideal distribution of our income. Our needs are subjective and therefore we cannot answer this question with a mathematical formula. We all earn different amounts, we have different consumption habits, and our preferences change all the time. Even though experts recommend that we should aim to save 10% of our monthly income, you need to adapt this rule to your lifestyle. If you can do more, that's great! On the other hand, if you can only save a few dollars a month, that is also great!  Anything you can save is better than nothing.  You can always start with something small and grow from there. Saving is more about consistency than quantity. Get in the habit and the numbers will follow. And if you have debt and your savings capability is diminished, it's good to remember that the money you use to pay your debt can eventually be reallocated to savings once your debt is repaid.  So, how do you see your panorama now? Are your savings goals realistic? Or do you have to change them? How much can you start saving today?  Everyone must find their own financial balance. '\""}

{"text": " Hooray to anyone willing to teach their children about budgeting for special events!  Successful money managers don't become that way overnight. It's a skill that needs to be taught and practiced from an early age. By teaching our children while they are under the safety of our roof, we can guide them through mistakes and help them learn.  Money management principles are the same at any age. The best way to teach children is to keep things at their level of understanding and make it fun.   Start With a Goal  Talk to your child and help them determine how much they need for the special event or purchase. Do some research with them. Spending time and discussing options can be fun. Talking about different ways to achieve the same result can build a skill that will be very useful later on in their life.    Take the goal of saving for a Disney trip or for a Mickey Mouse doll. Do some research online with your child. Discuss the difference in price for the different sizes of dolls. They may decide to go with a smaller, less expensive version once they see how expensive the larger dolls are. At a minimum, this research will help your child determine how much they need to save to get what they want.  Build the Plan  You will need to teach your children that slow and steady will win the race.  Take the amount of money needed and divide it by the number of allowances the child will receive over the time they'll be saving. Tell them that is the amount of money they need to put away each time. They can keep it in a bank account, a jar, or an envelope. Just make sure they keep it separate from their spending money. One fun idea is to draw a thermometer and track the savings by coloring in the savings as it grows. Keep it on the refrigerator or the wall in your child's room. This visual will help them see the progress and keep them motivated.  Be Encouraging  We all know that saving can become tedious. This is even true for adults, so children will need a lot of encouragement. When they start to waiver, remind them of the goal they set and help them to envision that final day when they reach the goal and have the money they want for the special event or purchase. A simple reminder that every candy bar they don't buy will move them closer to getting what they really want can do the trick.    On the other hand, sometimes we have to allow our children to learn from their mistakes. This is the hardest thing to do as a parent. We want to rescue our children when they are hurting. But, if we teach our children at an early age, with the little things, that they have choices and will suffer the consequences of those choices, we can save them from making the big mistakes in adulthood.  Celebrate Success!  Once your child has reached the goal, celebrate! Put on some music and dance around the room. Post their success on social media (if they're comfortable with it). This is a huge deal and should be treated as such. This will also reinforce the actions they took to get to this achievement which will encourage them the next time they have a financial goal.  For more information about teaching kids, Dave Ramsey has a series of children's books that teach money management principles. Junior learns about work, saving, spending, and giving. All are excellent books to read to or with your children. '\""}
{"text": " Saving money is important. Saving might seem difficult, especially if you are struggling to make ends meet or if you are in debt. However, everyone can create a savings plan. Even as you work toward paying off debt, saving is necessary and possible. If you put all of your money toward debt, you won't be able to handle everyday financial challenges. No matter your circumstances, saving for your future should be a priority.  Why Should I Save?  People create savings plans for different reasons. Here are some common reasons why people save even if they're in debt:  Emergencies  \u2013 Emergencies are those unexpected expenses that, without a savings plan, can be detrimental to your finances. A car or household appliance may need repairs; you or someone in your household may need medical treatment. In times like these, having some money already set aside in an emergency fund is a big help. Your emergency fund may start out small, with a goal of $300 \u2013 $500. Once you reach that goal, you can increase your goal to $1,000.  Loss of income  \u2013 Sometimes unexpected events occur that result in a loss of income. Someone in your household may get laid off, or a job where income fluctuates may go through a low period. In this case, it's helpful to have a reserve fund set aside. Try to set aside enough money to be able to cover a few months of expenses to give yourself time to regain a source of income.  Monthly or annual expenses \u2013 You may also benefit from saving for recurring expenses. Monthly expenses like utility bills or rent, and annual expenses like school supplies or holiday shopping, can be included in your savings plan. In these cases, the money you set aside will  only  go to these specific expenses that you expect to recur every month, year, or quarter. Personal goals  \u2013 It is great to strive toward personal goals. You may be eyeing a new television or car, or a family trip. Even if you can't make those big purchases right away, setting money aside will help you make those purchases in the future.  How to Save   There can be obstacles to saving. You do not have to set aside large amounts of money at a time. You can start small and add to your savings as time goes on. It's important to get into a habit of saving.!  Save a percentage of every dollar that comes into your household. This will add up in the long run.  Decrease your spending. Lower your cable service. Lower your phone service. Cancel a membership or subscription to a service that you do not use often. Eat out less. Choose less expensive brands of products. You can then set aside the money that used to go to these other costs. Increase your income. You may be able to get a second job or work some overtime. Sometimes extra income is unexpected. For example, you may get a bonus at work or a large tax refund. Instead of using the extra income as extra spending money, or even putting all of the money toward your debt, it is a good idea to set aside some of the money in an emergency or reserve fund.  Where to Save  Once you have money to save, it is a good idea to designate a place to put that money. I recommend storing your savings separate from your spending money so you are not tempted to spend it. You can open a savings account with your bank or even a separate bank. You can have separate accounts for emergencies, expenses, and personal goals. Make sure you know your bank's policies and possible fees associated with a new account. Some people put their savings onto a prepaid card. Again, carefully read your card's policies and fees if you choose this option.   Even though it may seem difficult, setting money aside for the future is important and possible. There are many reasons and methods when it comes to saving. Find what works best for you. Despite the obstacles, start saving for your future.   With hard work andcommitment, you can live debt-free! '\""}
