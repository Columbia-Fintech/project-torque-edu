{"prompt":"How much should I put in my 401(k)?","completion":" If you’re fortunate enough to have an employer who offers a 401(k), you should seriously consider participating. A 401(k) allows you to lower your tax bill and potentially build wealth through the stock market. Here’s how to figure out how much you should contribute.  The power of the employer match  You should contribute at least enough to fully take advantage of your employer match if you are offered one. If you don’t do that, you are simply leaving money on the table! For instance, your employer may match 100% of your contributions up to 5% of your salary. That means if you make $40,000 and contribute 5% of your salary ($2,000), your employer will contribute an additional $2,000. You are effectively doubling your money before anything happens in the stock market. If I came up to you and guaranteed that I would double your money if you invested with me, would you take me up on that?  Reasons to contribute more than the employer match amount  Should you stop there or contribute more than your employer match amount? Well, that depends on how much you have already saved. A good rule of thumb is to have one times your salary saved by age 30, three times by 40, and six times by 50 for retirement readiness. If you are running behind, you should probably try to contribute more than the employer match amount. Another important factor to consider is your goals. At what age do you want to retire? What type of lifestyle do you want in retirement? It may be necessary to increase your 401(k) contributions to reach your goals.   Small contributions can make a big difference   Contributing to your 401(k) and foregoing that money from your paycheck can seem tough. However, it’s important to contribute whatever you can, especially if you are young and have plenty of time to experience compound investment returns. For instance, based on the historical average of stock market earnings, contributing just $50 a month would grow to an estimated $100,000 in 30 years ($200,000 if those contributions were matched by the employer)! You should consider increasing your contributions as you get older and your income increases. A good rule of thumb is to start by contributing the employer match amount and then increase your contributions by one percent a year.  A 401(k) can be a powerful tool to save for retirement. If you’re not sure how much to contribute, don’t get frozen with indecision and miss out. Just go with your gut and see how it goes; you can always make adjustments later if necessary.  "} 
{"prompt":"Does the New $300 Cares Act Charitable Contribution Deduction Help Me With My Taxes?","completion":" Spoiler alert: Like many things in personal finance and taxes the answer is  it depends . And even when it does help, it won’t be much help for most of us.  First, some background on deducting charitable contributions.  Before the CARES Act was passed this year (2020), taxpayers generally had one option to deduct charitable contributions. They had to itemize instead of taking the  standard deduction . Most of us take the standard deduction because it gives us a bigger deduction than itemizing. A bigger deduction can mean less taxes paid and often a bigger refund.   The CARES Act permits eligible individuals to deduct $300 of qualified charitable contributions as an “above-the-line” deduction. So you can take this deduction without itemizing. To be eligible, these must be cash contributions (cash, check, debit, or credit). And the contributions must be to an organization that the IRS recognizes as eligible for deductible contributions, typically a charitable organization. This deduction applies to Federal taxes and continues after 2020.  What documentation or proof do I need to deduct charitable giving?  If you give $250 or more to one entity, you must receive and keep documentation from the organization acknowledging your contribution. Even if it’s less than $250, the IRS still says you should have documentation. But things like bank records and credit card records can suffice.  But will donations to charity help my tax situation?   For many, it will not help. You shouldn’t give money just to get a tax deduction. If you are at the 10% marginal tax rate, giving $300 at best saves $30 in taxes. That is not a good return. The reason to give should be that it is the right thing for you to do and you can afford it.  Every tax situation is different. If your tax situation includes receiving Earned Income Tax Credit and Additional Child Tax Credit, this may not help reduce your taxes or increase your refund. Here is one example: if you are married, not anyone else’s dependent, and file a joint tax return and your household gross income for 2020 is $24,800 a year or less– this deduction does not help you. You have already maxed your deductions for the year simply by being married and receiving the 2020 standard deduction of $24,800.   What if I’m not sure if it will help?  If you aren’t sure and have someone who prepares your taxes, then ask them. My guess is they’ll say the same thing I am going to say. And that is when you give money, keep the receipts and proof (the proof we talked about above). And then when you go to do your tax returns either bring it with you to your tax professional (or send it) or make sure you enter it in your tax software. Better to provide more information than less when it may help your tax situation.   If you would like to read more about the $300 charitable contribution deduction, I suggest going to  IRS.gov  and reading their tax tips.   Update and Clarification : The IRS has clarified that when filing a Married Filing Separate (MFS) tax return, the maximum charitable contribution deduction for non-itemizers is $150 for 2020. For other individuals and for Married Filing Jointly it is $300 for 2020. Also, for 2021 the Consolidated Appropriations Act increased this charitable contribution deduction for 2021 and later to $600 maximum for those filing Married Filing Joint tax returns. "} 
{"prompt":"What Is Interest?","completion":"The good, the bad, and the confusing! Interest can be your best friend (if you are earning it) or your worst enemy (if you are paying it). Interest is “the cost of money” you pay when you borrow (debt), or you earn when you lend (deposit money in a bank) money.  Of course, our deposits don’t earn nearly what we PAY in interest when we use credit or take out a loan, which is how financial institutions make money. They borrow from us (our deposits) and loan it to others (who pay interest on the loan). "} 
{"prompt":"The 4 Most Common Tax Errors You Should Watch Out For","completion":" It would be nice if we could have a simpler way to meet our tax obligations. But this is the system we have, and unfortunately errors are quite common. Let’s review some common errors that you should look out for.  1. Data Entry Errors  The IRS provides a  list of common errors . The most common issue is data entry errors, such as:  inputting the wrong social security number entering incorrect W-2 info spelling a name wrong  Some of these will be rejected immediately if you’re filing electronically. Some won’t. If it passes through the initial screening, maybe your return will never be right, or maybe it will be flagged later. This can take weeks or months to fix. Perhaps the worst of the data entry errors is to put the wrong bank account number for a direct deposit. So be attentive when entering data into your tax software!  2. Choosing the Wrong Filing Status  The five filing statuses are:  Single Head of Household Qualifying Widow(er) Married Filing Jointly Married Filing Separately  Filing correctly ensures you aren’t making a mistake that may cost thousands of dollars. There are cases when someone can be married and file as Head of Household, but the requirements are very specific. If you’re married and don’t meet those requirements, you must file either Married Filing Jointly or Married Filing Separate.  3. Incorrect Deductions  A friend may tell you that you can deduct something, and either you or they misunderstand the deduction. But somehow you make it fit into the tax software.  I had a client who deducted her car purchase ($27,000) as an itemized deduction because someone told her she could. She wasn’t self employed or a business owner. There is a case that  if  you itemize and  if  you claim sales tax as a deduction instead of income taxes paid that you  may  be able to add the sales taxes paid for a car purchase to your sales tax deduction. That is two “ifs” and a “may,” and even so, it isn’t the whole car purchase. My client owed the IRS over $2,000, plus penalties and interest. If a deduction sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If you don’t understand the questions the software is asking or it doesn’t look right, then it’s time to  look for professional help .   4. Mistakenly Claiming or Not Claiming a Dependent  This one can be complicated. It comes up often when parents aren’t married. But there are many other situations that involve this error as well. Read more about  when you can claim someone as a dependent . For more help, check out the IRS’s  Interactive Tax Assistant .  I’ve covered four common types of errors, but there are many more possible errors. You can avoid them by making sure you or your tax professional are focused and careful in your tax return preparation.  "} 
{"prompt":"How to Improve Your Credit","completion":" Improving your credit score won’t happen overnight, but you can make a difference over time by taking certain actions.  Step 1: Check for Errors  To start with, pull your credit report from from all three credit bureaus using  AnnualCreditReport.com . Normally, you get to do this once a year for free, but because of the pandemic, you can do it once a week for free! Review each item on all reports to make sure they’re complete and accurate. If you find any errors, you have the right to  dispute them directly  with the credit bureau. The bureau must research the matter and get back to you with an answer in 60 days. If the information is correct according to the bureau, they will leave it on your report.  What most people don’t know is that you have the right to put a 100-word explanation on your report. If you believe the report is incorrect, you can explain your side of the story. It won’t change your credit score, but it may make a difference to the person who is reviewing your credit bureau when you apply for your next loan.  Step 2: Pay Your Bills on Time  The most powerful way to improve your credit score is to pay every bill on time every month, month after month. Your payment history makes up 35% of your credit score. There is no way to go back and change history, but moving forward, pay on time. This will eventually improve your score, but it will take time.  Step 3: Pay Down Your Credit Card Balance  The next area that makes up 30% of your credit score is the balance that is carry on each of your credit cards. Did you know that if the balance you owe is more than one third of the credit limit, this hurts your credit score?For instance, if you have a credit card with a $3,000 limit, try not to use more than $1,000. Once the balance owed goes over $1,000, it starts to lower your credit score. If you have cards with high balances, review your budget and find some extra money to pay down these cards. The faster you get those balances down, the faster your credit score will go up.  Step 4: It Takes Time!  There are three other areas that make up the rest of your credit score: credit mix (10%), length of credit history (15%), and new credit (10%). You want to have a mix of credit accounts such as a mortgage, credit cards, and a car loan. Have you had credit for years or are you new to having credit? And lastly, if you have many new inquiries on your credit in a short amount of time, that will lower your credit score.   "} 
{"prompt":"How much income is enough?","completion":" How much income is enough?  Submitted by Charles A.  We would all like to know this! What is the income we need to lead a happy life? To find the true answer to this question, let’s take a tour of our personal habits.  Enough? For who? Where? With what lifestyle? Will it be enough forever or will it change? How do we achieve this?  Lifestyle Inflation  Numerous studies indicate that the more income we have,  the more we are willing to spend . Thus, if someone loves to buy jeans and increases their income, they will spend more money either buying a more expensive brand, more pants, or both. Does this sound familiar?  The real question we should ask ourselves is: to what extent will I let an increase in income become a new expense? If we experience a sudden increase in income and we increase in equal proportion our expenses, we will have a new standard of what is necessary to live. The problem with this vicious cycle is that it’s easy to acquire a new spending habit but a lot harder to abandon it. At the same time, we also can’t guarantee that we will always maintain our “higher” income.  Income is One Piece of the Puzzle  The question becomes more psychological than financial. While being human gives us the ability to adapt to changes, the process is rarely simple. For example, we can always sell our vehicle and travel by public transportation, but this may make us spend more time getting from Point A to Point B and cause stress for various other reasons.    Finding a balance between our income and our expenses determines our financial success. We have to differentiate between what we want and what we need to live. We may not have enough income for everything we want in life, but can almost certainly say that we’ll have enough to satisfy our needs.   There’s no mathematical equation or magic response that can answer the question of how much income you need. Common sense must reign in each of our decisions. So now, what is your next move?

{"prompt":"Something I ordered online was sent to the wrong address. What can I do?","completion":" I ordered stuff on Amazon and it was sent to a wrong address. I made a dispute with my bank, but they closed the dispute. They want me to pay to have this taken off my credit card statement. But I don’t believe that I owe them. What can I do?  Submitted by Richie B.  I’m really sorry this happened to you! Ordering merchandise over the internet can be very convenient and cost effective. But sometimes, as you stated in your question, it can be tricky! Not only was your merchandise sent to the wrong address, but also your bank refused to remove the charge on your credit card as you requested.  I recommend you try two avenues of recourse that may help rectify your situation.  Step 1: Contact the merchant  Try to reach the merchant by calling, emailing, or contacting them through social media accounts. Hopefully you can get in touch with someone at the company who can resolve your problem. Since they shipped your merchandise to the wrong address, they may be willing to redirect to the correct address or refund your money.  Step 2: Take it up with your credit card company  If you used your credit card, you have additional legal rights under the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA). The FCBA protects consumers from unfair billing practices. It provide a mechanisms for addressing billing errors in “open end” credit accounts. It states that a consumer must contact their credit card company within 60 days of a statement. The credit card company must then either correct your account or send you a written statement justifying the accuracy of the billing.  ***  Between calling the shipper and utilizing the (FCBA) consumer laws, you can either get your merchandise or your money refunded soon.

{"prompt":"Should I Give My Child an Allowance? How Much Should I Give Them?","completion":" It’s never too early to teach your kids about money.  I wish I had learned about the ins and out of money at a much younger age. Growing up, my parents never talked about money in front of me. It was one of those subjects you didn’t talk about with anyone. I had to learn most of my money lessons the hard way.  There are two major schools of thought on paying your children an allowance; there is paying for chores and not paying for basic chores. Let’s do a deeper dive into those options.  Option 1: Pay Allowance for Chores  Paying an allowance when children complete chores teaches that we all work for money. If you don’t do the work, then you don’t get paid. This does teach a real-world lesson. However, the flip side is that many believe you are paying kids to do chores that they should be doing anyway. What happens if your child decides they don’t need the money this week and won’t do chores? I don’t want this to add stress to your life.  Option 2: Pay a Flat Allowance Each Week  The second school of thought is to pay a flat allowance each week. This requires that basic chores be done as a part of the family. This gives children the security of real money each week. However, many believe it teaches children to be entitled because they have money handed to them without work.  Option 3: A Middle Ground  There is a third option that is a combination of the two approaches. You pick and choose the best parts of both options for your family. You can build a plan like basic chores are required with a set allowance, but children have the option to earn extra money by doing extra chores.  Sit down as a family and create a list of extra chores. Here are some ideas: washing the dog, raking leaves, washing windows. Then, when your kids want to earn a little extra money, they can choose an extra chore from the list. Make sure you let your kids know what chores you expect them to do and make sure you keep having the conversation as they get older. This also gives you a reason to continue the money conversation. Make sure you don’t use allowance as a punishment. This is their first experience with money, and we want it to be a positive one.  How Much Money Should I Give for Allowance?  The last part of the conversation about allowance is how much is appropriate. Some experts say $1 for each year of age, but this is a very personal decision based on your financial situation. When you are setting an amount, try to stick to that amount and pay your children in cash so they get used to handling money.  When you start giving your children cash, this is the perfect time to start the discussion of saving, sharing, and spending. Talk with them about saving for a special item, and about putting some of their money away for sharing with others, maybe they have a special organization they would like to help. I love the idea of three different containers so they can see the money inside, and watch it grow which is something we all love to see.  More Resources to Help You Talk to Your Kids About Money  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website has  Money As You Grow activities  to help you start the money conversation with your children, starting at age three. They have great games and activities to help you make learning fun and educational. You can print games and get ideas for starting the conversation based on your children’s ages. With small children, you can start by identifying different coins. With teenagers, you’ll think about buying a car and understanding credit cards. It is all free! "} 
{"prompt":"Can I transfer my HSA to another financial institution?","completion":" I have a HSA through my company. I don’t like their services and investing options. Can I transfer some of the funds I have to a new account at another financial institution?  Submitted by Sudawan K.  Take a moment and pat yourself on the back for planning ahead for your medical expenses. Not everyone does, so I want to acknowledge that you are doing it. Congratulations! I was talking about your question with my #MoneyBuddy  Brandy Baxter , and being the money nerd she is, she got all excited and started rattling off ideas. So here we go!  Tax Benefits of an HSA  First, the money you contribute to your HSA is a tax-planning power play. You contribute money with pre-tax dollars, which lowers your tax liability. Plus, the money earns interest tax-free, and is tax-free when you use it for qualifying medical expenses. This is a great benefit if you or your family  tend to have lots of medical expenses not covered by insurance. Another benefit is the balance of your account rolls over year after year, so you don’t lose any of the money you’re saving.  Finding a New Bank  My first question for you: have you found another bank that has better investment options? If you haven’t, that’s okay. But be sure to do that before making any moves. When you decide to move your funds to another account, they can easily be transferred to another bank as long as the new bank also offers HSA accounts.  Funds Rollover Versus Trustee to Trustee Transfer  This next point is important, so take notes. There are two types of transfers you can do with your HSA: a funds rollover and a trustee to trustee transfer.  We went straight to the  IRS website  to get the lowdown on this topic. A funds rollover occurs when your current HSA account holder sends you a check and you deposit the amount into your new account. Failure to make the deposit into a qualifying HSA account within 60 days of receiving the check will result in a penalty. Yikes! Please don’t make this mistake.  A trustee to trustee transfer is when you authorize your HSA provider to transfer the funds directly to your new HSA provider. This is important, because the money never comes to you in this type of transaction. This means no penalties (or the danger of missing a deadline). Simply ask your new provider to give you a trustee to trustee form. After completing, you’re all set and on your way to earn more money on your investment! "} 
{"prompt":"I own a home, but I would like to move and rent out my home. What’s my best option?","completion":" I own a home that I bought only two years ago. In five years, I would like to relocate to Nevada. I’d like to rent out my existing home to have some net income, but I also would like to purchase another home in Nevada. I have no savings for a down payment for the new home. What would be my best option?  Submitted by Lisa C.  Congratulations on thinking ahead to your future goals and building the wealth to achieve them! Five years is a great timeline to set up a S.M.A.R.T goal.  What is a SMART Goal?  Those letters stand for: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound. Use this as a guide to planning out your goal:  What do you specifically want to do? How will you measure that you’re doing it? Is this goal achievable and realistic for where you are currently? Will you be able to achieve it in the time frame you want?  Crunch the Numbers  Start by doing a little research to figure out how much you may need for a down payment on a new home.  Take the amount you want to save for a down payment and divide it by 5. This will give you an amount to save each year. Then take that amount and divide by 12. This will give you an amount to save each month.  Determine if you can realistically save this amount each month to help cover the down payment. If the amount is too high, start thinking of creative ways to earn extra money so you can reach your goal. Or, set a price range for the future home that gives you flexibility in how much to save.  Research the Rental Market  Next, research to find out if the current rental market will bring enough revenue to cover the mortgage payment on your current home. If so, you may want to rent it now for six months to a year to see if you really want to be a landlord. Being a landlord has its pros and cons. Having a “landlord” experience before you move could help you decide if you want to be a long-distance landlord.  Finally, over the next five years, watch the housing market in Nevada and the rental market in your current area to see how the prices fluctuate and determine how any changes will affect your plan.

{"prompt":"What apps do you recommend to track your spending habits?","completion":"This is the interface of You Need a Budget, one of the budgeting apps I’m trying out currently.     What free or low-cost software/apps do you recommend to track your spending habits? There are so many out there to choose from and some are overly complicated and others require too much work.  Submitted by Brittany.  Let’s check out a few of them and talk about how to choose.  Your Credit Union or Bank  Your credit union or bank probably has an app that allows you to create a budget and track your spending. The challenge, which is true for most apps, is that getting set up can be time consuming. If most of your transactions are electronic, like cards or automatic transfers, this may be the best choice for you since most of your income and expenses will be captured.  Mint  If you use a lot of cash or other cards, Mint might be a better option. Mint is one of the most well known apps and it’s owned by Intuit. One of the strengths of Mint is that it allows you to aggregate all of your accounts (including your bank, credit, investments, and even the value of your other assets), so you have a built-in balance sheet. Mint is still free, but they try to sell products, so beware of that if you choose this app.  You Need a Budget (YNAB)  I’m checking out You Need A Budget, affectionately called YNAB,  again  for the 34 day trial. There is some setup (6 “easy” steps) and it is NOT free, but the cost may be worth it if you are willing to “give every dollar a job” and consult the app BEFORE you make a purchase. This is actually the real value of YNAB: being able to easily check your budget before you spend.  What’s right for you?  So, how do you decide? First of all, it is great that there are many good apps to help you track your spending – but the  best  app is the one that works for you. Check out the few we have talked about here and choose one to try. If you find that in 60 days you aren’t satisfied, try another one (think of it as a “Plan B”) and remember that the point is to find a system that  works for you .  Be gentle with yourself during the set up. It doesn’t have to be perfect to be helpful. Start with your living expenses (what you  must  pay) and add your lifestyle expenses (what you  choose  to spend) over a month or two. Keep in mind that you are building new habits and that can take time. Practice makes better.  Let me know which one(s) you choose to try. If you are joining me on the YNAB trial period, let me know what you think and I’ll do the same at the end of my 34 day trial. "}

{"prompt":"How can I fix my credit to buy a house for the first time?","completion":" My husband and I want to buy a house for first-time buyers. How can we fix our credit?  Submitted by Ferlenzia M.  Owning a home is a dream that many people have. To make that dream a reality, most people get a mortgage loan. To qualify for that type of loan, you need steady income, savings for upfront costs, low debt, and “good” credit. The minimum credit score depends on the type of loan you are getting. For example, a conventional loan requires a credit score of least 620. Alternatively, a government-backed FHA loan allows for a minimum credit score of 580. Both types of loans are offered by most lenders.  If your credit score doesn’t meet the threshold for the type of loan you are seeking, the first thing you should know is that raising your credit score takes time and a history of on-time payments – of at least six months.   Below are some tips for building your credit score:  Correct any inaccurate information  If you find a mistake on your credit report, follow the instructions provided to fix the mistake.  Pay bills on time  Your payment history, or track record of paying your bills on time, is the most significant factor of your credit score. Commit to making on-time payments by preparing and following a realistic spending plan and setting up bill payments systems that work for you.  Minimize outstanding debt  How much you owe is also an important factor of your credit score. Your debt load affects your ability to borrow and how much you can borrow. Keep your debt manageable by borrowing cautiously and keeping balances low on credit cards. If you have existing debt, make a plan to pay it off or down.  Re-establish credit  If you have had problems paying your bills on time, get and stay current on past due accounts. Open new accounts strategically and pay them on time to raise your score over the long term. Your options include:  A secured loan or credit card , where your savings acts as collateral if you do not make your payments. If you are considering a secured credit card, look for one with limited uses and a low interest rate. A loan with a co-signer  – someone who agrees to be responsible for the payments if you do not make them.  Whichever way you choose to re-establish your credit, it is critical that you make your payments in full and on time. With time and focused attention, you can get your credit score where it needs to be to realize your dream of homeownership. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Get Back on Track After a Financial Emergency","completion":"Let’s talk about what to do when the emergency hits. We aren’t trying to bum you out, but the fact is, we are all likely to have a financial shock.  What happens when you have to use your emergency fund?  First, pat yourself on the back for having the funds, and then strategize. Using your emergency fund is not a financial death sentence. You saved it so you would be ready when a financial upset occurs. The key here is to stay motivated. Becoming discouraged about using the money you saved for the very thing you planned is like being upset about eating your birthday cake ON YOUR BIRTHDAY! Who does that?  So, if (or when) you use your emergency fund, remember this:   How did it feel to have the money to deal with the emergency?  What would you have done if you didn’t have the emergency fund?   Then, do this:   Start again  – if necessary, put “emergency fund” back on your list of financial priorities and set aside money each month to get back to your target.  Jumpstart your savings  by practicing a  stretch goal . Even a small amount will remind you of how you felt when you were building your fund.  Just in case : if your emergency need is bigger than your emergency fund and you need a loan, check out your  local credit union  to see if you qualify for a small dollar loan. You will usually find better interest rates and terms than at other financial institutions.  "} 
{"prompt":"Four Tips for What to Do With Your Tax Refund","completion":" Many of us dread filing our taxes, yet we look forward to receiving a tax refund. Those of us with families often use those funds to provide for them.  However, besides paying bills, buying necessities, and using it as fun money, I’d like you to consider using some or all of your refund to improve your long-term financial health.  1. Make extra debt payments  Having debt reduces your options. Paying off your debt allows you to enjoy your tax refund every month of the year! You’ll have more room in your budget for your other financial priorities. And using that money for debt may be a jump start on the path of  becoming debt-free .   2. Boost your savings  Maybe you could use some more money in your emergency fund. Maybe you need to save for your next car.  If you struggle with spending money that is sitting in your bank account, there is another option. When you file your Federal tax return, you can choose to apply your refund or a portion of your refund to US Savings Bonds, I bonds. The I bonds have some inflation protection and the portion of the refund designated for the savings bonds won’t pass through your bank account. Note that you can’t cash in I bonds for the first year and there is an interest penalty if cashed in before 5 years. Your tax software or tax professional may offer this option. If they don’t, look for or ask for Form 8888 to direct some of your refund to I bonds. You can also use Form 8888 to direct your refund to multiple accounts. For example, you can direct some of your refund directly to your savings account and send the money you plan to spend to your checking account.   3. Boost your retirement investing  Your future self will thank you if you contribute to your retirement fund! I still haven’t met anyone who said they saved too much for retirement, but if this is you, please let me know.   4. Bonus – Plan for your taxes next year  You may be able to lower your tax refund by reducing your tax withholding during the year. This could result in more take-home money each paycheck. This may help you manage your monthly bills or savings. You do this by adjusting your W-4 with your employer.

{"prompt":"What’s the difference between a bank and a credit union?","completion":"What is the difference between a bank and a credit union?  Submitted by anonymous.  Banks and credit unions serve similar roles in our financial system. Both hold our deposits and make investments to raise money to lend to businesses and individuals.  In general, banks are for-profit businesses. Their profits benefit their shareholders. This is one of the main differences between the two types of institutions. Credit unions are nonprofit entities where you become a “member” (actually a shareholder) when you open an account. While they offer the same services as most banks, they often offer lower fees and higher interest rates on accounts.  I am a fan of banking in your own community (that’s how we use our dollars to create the community we want) and generally recommend credit unions or community banks. "} 
{"prompt":"What Is a Mortgage?","completion":"A mortgage is a loan to purchase a home or land. When you begin planning to buy a home, shopping for mortgages is one of the steps you can take to find out how much you can afford. Mortgages are offered by banks or credit unions and the loan is secured (guaranteed) by the property you purchase.  The process can seem overwhelming, but with good planning and the right help, getting a mortgage for your home purchase may be easier than you think. Check out this  short video  on how mortgages work. "} 
{"prompt":"Why do credit sites recommend I get another credit card?","completion":" I’ve worked hard to get my credit score into the excellent range using only one credit card .  I pay monthly before the due date. Why do credit sites like Credit Karma and Credit Sesame keep suggesting I get another credit card to improve my score even more? What is the impact on a credit score when applying for a new card?  Submitted by Rick D.  Congratulations! You have very positive habits around your credit and debt management. I’m impressed that you pay your bills on time, and many times ahead of the due date. Plus, you only have one credit card and you pay it off every month.  You have maintained excellent credit history (35% of the credit score) and a low credit card utilization rate* (30% of your credit score). Clearly this is sufficient to maintain a high credit score. Length of credit makes up another 15% of your score. Plus, types of credit and inquiries represent 10% of the score each. If you apply for credit, it’s possible that your credit score may dip if you have too many inquiries in the last two years. (Two years is the most inquiries can stay on your credit report by law.)  Don’t feel pressured to apply for credit if you don’t need it. Most lenders advertise to get more loans out to build their loan portfolios. They often use sites like Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, and others to market their loan products. When I was a loan manager at a credit union, my job was to find platforms to sell our loan products. However, it appears your credit and debt are under control. As you indicated, you work hard to maintain that control. So I advise you to continue practicing positive financial behavior and habits!  *Credit utilization rate is the amount of money you owe divided by your total credit limit for those credit cards. Example: You owe $30 and you have a $100 credit limit. That equals a 30% utilization rate. "}

{"prompt":"Forget resolutions – it’s time for a financial New Year’s revolution!","completion":"It’s New Year’s resolution season! Even though many resolutions don’t make it until the end of winter, it can still be a helpful exercise for many people.  Many years ago, I decided to begin each year with a financial  revolution ! Check out how  Merriam Webster  defines revolution:   the action by a celestial body of going round in an orbit or elliptical course (not this one… that might leave me back where I started!)  a sudden, radical or complete change (ah…getting closer. I like it but when I try radical change I sometimes can’t keep it up, so…)  a fundamental change in the way of thinking about or visualizing something (Bingo! This is it!)   Thinking about what you want to do differently can help you align your values with your actions. So, where do we begin?  How was 2018?  Let’s start with what you already know: how was 2018 for you? Reflect on last year and ask yourself:   What worked for you?  What didn’t work?   This is a good starting point for figuring out what you want to change in the new year.  Making measurable resolutions for 2019  With your 2018 finances and financial behaviors in mind, what do you want to do differently this year?  Make sure your goals are measurable. For example, instead of resolving to “save more,” define what that means to you  and  what is important about saving. Do you want to save $20 or $100 a month? Or do you want to save up a specific amount by the end of the year?  A financial goal is usually more effective if we make it SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound). So try something like this:  S : I want to complete the 52 week saving challenge this year  M : I will do this by following the saving plan each week by putting the money in a savings account  A : I can achieve this goal by paying myself first each time I received regular or unexpected income  R : This is important to me because I worry when I don’t have emergency savings.  T : My milestones will be a weekly deposit (on Saturday) and the end goal is $1,378 by December 15th.  Decide how you’ll check your progress. Is there an app you use to measure your savings, or will you check the balance in your savings account regularly?  How will you make it happen?  Now that you know what, when, and how you want this change to happen, it’s time to make a plan and execute! Include check-in points to evaluate your progress and adjust your goals. If there are any resources you need, like an accountability partner or a separate savings account, get that in place as well.  Be realistic with yourself to make sure you’re setting yourself up for success. Doing something differently with money can be challenging, so think about how you’re going to maintain momentum. I’m confident that creating a solid plan to achieve your revolution will improve your chances of following through!  Bonus: Your financial book club!  I certainly know what one of my resolutions is this year: to read and educate myself even more about finances and different perspectives. If you want to join me in this resolution, there are two books that I think everyone should read:   The Richest Man in Babylon  by George Clausen  Mind Over Money  by Brad Klontz   In the spirit of saving, check these out from your local library!     Photo by  Martin Hauenstein  from  Pexels "} 
{"prompt":"Four Myths about Personal Finance","completion":"There are a lot of financial myths out there that simply aren’t true! Making good financial decisions starts with having the correct information you need to make those decisions. I’m going to go through four common myths about personal finance to get to the bottom of those misconceptions.  1. “Paying rent is throwing away money.”  Paying rent is a living expense just like food, clothes, gas, or other transportation costs. This myth is usually coupled with “homeownership is the ONLY surefire investment” (which is also not true). Think about it: the point of paying rent is to have a place to live, right? So, if what you are paying for (a place to live) is getting you what you need, that is by definition NOT throwing away money. Owning a home is a big commitment and it isn’t for everyone. There are lots of  pros and cons to this decision , so be realistic about your needs and which approach best meets those needs.  2. “Bad credit takes forever to rebuild.”  Good credit is an asset! Having bad credit can feel like a hopeless situation. There are some things that take longer to correct on your credit report, but that is not the same as hopeless. There are  a few things you can do right away  to put yourself on track to a higher credit score.  3. “I’m young – I have plenty of time to save for retirement!”  Being young is definitely a major advantage for retirement planning and the fact is, you do have plenty of time. The challenge is that you have no idea what that time will bring (both ups and downs), so the earlier you prepare, the less you will need to save as you get older. Check out this  retirement calculator  to see how much of a perk being young is when it comes to retirement planning.  4. “I’m old – it’s too late to save for retirement”  Every day is a new day. Although you can’t change the choices you made in the past (if you figure this one out, let me know, okay?), focus on what you can do now to prepare for life in retirement. This may mean making some adjustments to the traditional ideas of retirement – that can mean anything and you get to decide what it means for you. I changed careers at when I was over 40 because I simply wasn’t going to have enough to retire in my 60s. If retirement age is approaching fast and you feel like you’re running tight on time, start where you are now.  Get a clear picture of your current situation and then design your “encore” years. Once you know where you are going, you can create a plan to get there. I simply LOVE  this woman’s approach  to dealing with the shift in her retirement reality. "} 
{"prompt":"Create a Spending and Saving Plan: The 80/20 Strategy","completion":"It takes guts to take charge of your money situation and we know you can do it.  Let’s get to work.  How many of us have a budget?  Check this out: we ALL have a budget. Yup, it’s true. We all HAVE a budget; we might not know what it is, but we have one. Money comes in and money goes out – that cash flow IS our budget. You are already spending your money and you are probably spending it on the things you need AND some of the things you want.  The question is, are you happy with the amount you are saving? Not really? We think you might be happier if you decide on a specific amount to save BEFORE spending. Let’s try the 80/20 spending and saving plan.  80/20 Spending and Saving Plan  Divide your income like this:   80% for living expenses (rent, debt, food, clothing, gasoline)  20% for savings (you can break down your savings by categories)  10% for long term goals (retirement/work optional lifestyle)  5% for emergencies ( you know about this, right? )  5% for specific short term goals (vacations, major purchases)     With this  Budget Builder , you can see how your monthly spending compares to recommended estimates in your area.  Remember, you are the boss. Some of us have to spend 90% on living expenses. That’s okay, you’ll just need to adjust your saving amount. The bottom line here is that YOU are in control. Give every dollar you earn a “job.”  For more about the 80/20 rule and making your money work for you,  check out this video . "} 
{"prompt":"4 IRS Tools You Should Know About to Help You File Your Taxes","completion":" Let’s take a look at IRS.gov for some tools you may find helpful as you file your taxes!  Where’s My Tax Refund?  You can check your refund status on  irs.gov  to know whether the IRS has received your refund and is processing it. You can also read more about  how to track your refund .  Download Tax Records or Transcripts  The IRS website can provide your tax records or transcripts. Note that this isn’t a photocopy of your return. If you want that, you have to mail in  Form 4506 . There is a fee for a copy of your actual tax return. Fortunately, tax transcripts are often free (for the most recent ones) and most of us can get them online. There are several different versions, so if you aren’t sure which version you need for a particular year I recommend downloading or printing all of them that are available for the year in question. If you can’t get original tax documents, the wage and income transcript is the one that is most often needed to fix a prior year tax return or to file a return for a year that was missed.  The thing to remember about this transcript is that for many documents, such as W-2s, it only shows the information that is pertinent to the Federal government. So it may not have all the information you would need for a state return. Also, note that the Wage and Income transcript for the current year tax information may not be available until July. So a 2020 W-2 that is required to be filed in 2021 may not be shown on a transcript until July of 2021. You can  request tax transcripts and get more information .  Get Answers to Your Tax Questions with the Interactive Tax Assistant  The IRS has provided the  Interactive Tax Assistant  to help answer tax questions for your particular situation. You can search for your question or choose from the list of common questions. One example is: Is my Tip Income Taxable? Most of the topics take about 15 minutes to go through the assistant, with you answering guiding questions to determine the answer for you.  The Interactive Tax Assistant is a good way to check if what someone tells you is true or if what you are doing on your tax return is right. But it isn’t foolproof, so consult IRS publications and instructions or consult a tax professional if there is any doubt.  Tax Publications and Instructions  I know most of us don’t like digging into tax code to figure out how to fill out forms, but sometimes that is the best place to find your answer. IRS.gov provides a huge number of forms, publications, and instructions in pdf and html format for free. You can also order printed copies if you prefer.  See all IRS Forms, Instructions, and Publications.  IRS.gov is full of information you may find useful. There is even tax news if you’d like to read it! Often going straight to this source will give you the most accurate information, so don’t be afraid to use it. After all, your taxes paid for it. "} 
{"prompt":"Can I file taxes if my income was only SS and SSI?","completion":" Submitted by Veronica C.  Living on only social security income tells me that you are resourceful and doing a good job managing your money. (SS is the benefit that you pay into during your working years and  SSI  is supplemental income designed to provide additional support for specific situations.) This question is tricky because I’m not a tax professional and this falls in the area of tax planning. A tax professional is the right person to tell you exactly what to do. But that doesn’t mean I won’t give you my best thinking on resources! So here goes.  You may or may not be required to file taxes if social security benefits were your only source of income.  Form 703  on the IRS website gives you an idea if you need to pay taxes on your SSI.  The other tricky part is  some of your SSI may be taxable  if your income is above the limits set by the IRS. This is definitely a conversation to have with a tax professional or a  taxpayer advocate .  Visit the website, download the form, and arm yourself with information before you seek out the info you need.  Remember that if you’re eligible for SSI, you can use VITA or TCE for all of your tax preparation. They are trained professionals and it is free! Go get ‘em! "} 
{"prompt":"What can I do when there is an ongoing medical emergency?","completion":"What happens when an emergency is ongoing? My husband had a stroke, and a) can no longer work; and b) now has high medical bills. We’re drowning financially, and it is going to be an ongoing issue.  Submitted by Amy A.  First, we are so sorry your family is going through this difficult time. The first step is applying for benefits to provide some relief as you plan for a new financial reality. If you haven’t already done so, start with the  Social Security Administration . This  checklist  can help you gather the information you need to get started.  Once you have taken this step, you can begin to look into other supports and resources:   Visit  211.org  or call 211 to find organizations near you that provide support.  Savings or other assets in excess of $2,000 can impact your eligibility for some benefits, so it may be advantageous to get the support of a financial coach to help you manage any existing resources in order to stabilize your housing and other necessities.  Visit the  CFPB website  or the  Financial Empowerment Center  network to see if there is a financial coach in your area. Seek coaching or counseling services from a reputable organization that provides services  at no cost to you .   This adjustment will be challenging so be prepared to take the first steps, then assess what you need going forward. It will be necessary to reframe your perspective from “emergency” to “new normal” and take care of yourself during this process. You may have to make some difficult decisions around how to prioritize payments to creditors to ensure your situation doesn’t get worse. This is where having an objective support system (a coach or counselor) can help you make the decisions that are best for your family in the long term.  Self care is crucial. There are many organizations that can provide emotional support (again, 211) as you rise up to the new challenges you are facing. We too are in your corner, wishing you and your husband the very best. "} 
{"prompt":"4 Ways to Protect Yourself from Financial Abuse","completion":"Even if you are doing all you can to manage your money, we know there are some circumstances where your bank, job, or landlord may be taking advantage of you. These situations can be financial land mines, so it’s crucial to know your rights and get help if you need it.  Let’s take a look at some common abusive practices that can hinder your best efforts to achieve financial security.  1. Where You Bank  We don’t have to look very far to see abusive practices in our financial systems. Payday lenders, for example, charge outrageous interest rates that create cycles of financial destruction. These practices are unfortunately quite common, but we only hear about the abusive practices of more mainstream financial institutions when there is a big incident affecting lots of people.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has an extensive database of complaints that you can check. While not all banking practices are abusive, it’s worth your attention to make sure you aren’t inadvertently giving away your hard-earned money. Check out the  CFPB website  to learn what to do if you have common issues like unauthorized transactions or hidden fees.  2. Where You Work  The  “gig” economy  provides lots of opportunities to bridge financial gaps and generate income to meet basic financial needs. Unfortunately, this way of working has a downside if you’re working with or for an employer that treats you like a consultant to avoid paying taxes or benefits. There aren’t hard and fast rules and each situation is different, but generally, if your boss can decide when, where, and how you work, you are an employee. Being a consultant has some benefits and you can  start here  to learn more about the difference between being an employee or a contractor, and what to do if you are misclassified.  You can also get info on how to manage your taxes as a contractor at the  Self-Employed Tax Center , so you can include payments to your uncle (Sam) in your pricing and budgeting.  3. Where You Live  Evictions, lock outs, and disagreements over security deposits are some of the most common disputes between tenants and landlords. Fortunately, if you’re renting, you can get support from local and federal government agencies. The first thing you’ll notice when you check out the  tenant’s rights page  at the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) webpage is that each state has its own rules, so start at the source and be sure to get information from reputable organizations like  HUD Housing Counseling  in your area. The website also has resources for legal support, housing advocates, and rent stabilization boards or councils.  4. Recognizing Financial Abuse  Financial abuse can take many forms ( domestic/partner ,  senior ) and the first step to address the situation to recognize is to write down what you are experiencing (don’t worry about trying to figure out the solution), identify a trusted resource to help you look at it objectively, and then decide on the best course of action to protect yourself.

{"prompt":"How to Break the Paycheck-to-Paycheck Cycle","completion":" It can be so frustrating when you have more month than money! Everything is a battle and a challenge, just living day to day. The trick to getting out of that cycle is to make a plan for every single dollar. If you decide where you will spend your money before you receive it, you can make better choices and alleviate some of the stress.  Start With a Budget  Add up all of your income for the month. Next, subtract all your expenses. If you are unsure what those are, you need to do a little investigating. Start by going to your bank statement and pulling 30 days’ worth of spending. Then categorize every purchase. You will have food, eating out, snacks and drinks, gas for your car, and any other category you find.    After you have recorded the entire 30 days, add up each column.  Now you know what to put in each expense of your budget. You will want to put your fixed expenses as well. Those are the ones that are the same every month, like rent and car payment. When you subtract all of your expenses from all of your income, do you have a negative number? If you live paycheck-to-paycheck, you probably do.  That means you need to review every line on your budget and determine if what you are spending money on is moving you in a direction you want to go. Sometimes, those small purchases day after day are what keep us from financial security. Is that cup of coffee from the coffee shop making you feel secure or would brewing a cup at home and saving the money make you feel better? Only you can answer that question.  Focus on Your Spending  Then you can find the extra money you need to start saving. Even if you can only save $5 a month, every little bit helps. Having a savings account to fall back on when a disaster strikes will keep you off the paycheck-to-paycheck merry-go-round.  If you are absolutely watching every dollar and still don’t have enough to cover all your necessities, the other option is to add income. There are options other than a part time job (which of course would also help). Think about cleaning a friend’s home twice a month, getting a roommate, or cleaning out that storage shed and having a sale. Brainstorm and come up with an idea that works for you. Think outside the box!  The choice is up to you. You are in control of your situation; you just have to be willing to make the necessary changes and make the hard choices. The good news is, this won’t be forever. As you practice your money management skills and start to master them, you can get out of the paycheck-to-paycheck rut. "} 
{"prompt":"“Sharing is Caring” – Does that Apply to Bank Accounts?","completion":"Ah, opening a joint bank account or credit card – so easy to do, yet so hard to untangle if things don’t go as planned.  Once you open a joint account, the money that was “yours” is now “ours.” That’s a big step for any relationship. Make sure you’re on the same page about how you will manage money as a couple.  Pitfalls of Joint Accounts  Like any financial decision, opening a joint account has risks and rewards. Co-owners of an account can legally spend, give away, or transfer funds to other accounts. They don’t need consent or knowledge of other account holders. This leaves you with relatively little protection.  Before you take this step, make sure you’re confident with your reasons for opening a joint account. What are your goals? Are there other ways to achieve those goals?  Financial Infidelity  As you think about opening a joint account, consider your views on financial privacy and “financial infidelity.” Do you think you or your partner should be allowed to keep some aspects of your financial lives separate and private? The National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE) reports that  over 40% of American adults who combine finances with a partner commit financial deceptions  against their significant other. Plus, 75% of adults say financial deceit has affected their relationship.  Watch Your Credit Score  Joint credit cards can impact your credit score negatively, but they can also improve your credit score! If one partner uses credit beyond their means to pay, this can create financial hardship and conflict.  Check Your Money Values  Understanding how your financial values differ from those of your partner is key to managing money together.  NEFE’s LifeValues quiz  can help you identify the values that drive your financial decisions. I encourage you to take the quiz and compare results with your partner.  If you come out with different results, that’s okay! Use that as a starting point to talk about how you’ll manage different perspectives, behaviors, and values.  Benefits of Joint Accounts  Managing money together can be beneficial for both parties. It’s an opportunity to learn about each other’s money personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. It can also allow someone with lower credit to get more favorable credit terms (lower interest rates, higher credit limits) and improve their credit.  The key is communication. If you can’t talk openly about the pros and cons of opening a joint account, it might be better to manage your money separately until you’re on the same page. "} 
{"prompt":"The 3 Most Common Tax Myths","completion":" Our Federal tax code is complicated. One thing this causes is misunderstandings of tax law. I like to call these misunderstandings “tax myths.” Like many myths, tax myths often have some truth in them. Let’s look at three common tax myths.  1. I Don’t Want to Go Up to a New Tax Bracket  Sometimes people think that if they go up a Federal tax bracket, all of their income will be taxed at the higher rate. This is not true. Let’s look at the first two brackets for filing single in 2020. If your taxable income (after deductions) is $9,875 or less, your tax rate is 10% on this money. But if your taxable income goes up to $20,875, then you are squarely in the 12% tax bracket. That means that $9,875 is subject to the 10% tax rate. The extra $11,000 is subject to the 12% tax rate.  Also, tax credits can lower your effective tax rate, even down to zero. Higher income can cause your taxes to go up and can reduce some tax credits. But if you make more money, you will have more money!  2. Don’t Worry, I’ll Deduct It  This statement implies that your expense won’t actually cost you anything. That is rarely the case. If your marginal tax rate is 12%, then in most cases if you spend $100 that is deductible, you will only get $12 of it “back” through your tax return. And that is assuming it is really deductible.  In the gig economy, many of us have self-employed income. If you have self-employed or business income, you can deduct qualifying expenses. The key is the word “qualifying.” You should know if something is deductible or not before deducting it, or better yet before the spending. Also, if you aren’t self-employed and you aren’t in the position to itemize, meaning you take the standard deduction instead of adding up Schedule A deductions, then most likely you can’t deduct more than the  new $300 charitable contribution  above the line deduction ($600 for MFJ filers for tax year 2021 and beyond).   3. I’ll Buy a House to Reduce Taxes  Most realtors are great people. They help other people realize their dreams. But every year I sit down with clients who are excited about getting the tax benefit for the house they bought. And for most of those clients I have to tell them that the house isn’t going to help them with their taxes. Many say, “But my realtor said I would save on taxes!” That is true only if you are in the position to itemize on the Schedule A and if itemizing will get you higher than the standard deduction. You can either itemize or take the standard deduction. The most typical things people itemize on a Federal return are:   Mortgage interest paid Real estate taxes State and local taxes Charitable contributions There are more, but they are less common  For filing head of household in 2020, those would have to add up to more than $18,650. It would be $24,800 for Married Filing Jointly. Most of us aren’t in the position to itemize that much. So most of us shouldn’t be buying a house to “save on taxes.”  ***  Please leave this article with this recommendation: if someone tells you something about taxes, make sure it is correct before making a decision based on that information. You need to figure out whether it’s relevant for you and your situation. If you have access to a tax professional, then consult them. If you don’t,  IRS.gov  has loads of information organized into tax topics and in their publications.  "} 
{"prompt":"What is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)? How Does Unemployment Income Impact It?","completion":" Sign up for SaverLife  to take the Tax Time Pledge and enter to win cash prizes.  The Federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) exists to help working Americans of modest income. In 2019, 25 million taxpayers received a total of $63 billion in EITC funds. The average amount a family received was just over $2,400. It’s a good chunk of money, and many families count on it to make ends meet.  How the EITC is different this year  Did you earn less in 2020 than 2019? You could qualify for a bigger tax refund! Congress approved a new “lookback rule” which means you can use either your 2019 or 2020 income on your taxes to get the biggest refund possible this year. Make sure you have your 2019 tax return available when you do your taxes this year.  If you receive the EITC, how does unemployment income impact that credit?   You may have heard me say this before regarding many personal finance questions, but the answer is:  It depends.  In 2020, a lot of Americans received unemployment, particularly after the CARES Act extended unemployment benefits.   Note : This discussion assumes you are qualified to receive EITC.  Explore whether or not you are qualified.  Here’s the bad news. Unemployment income will not increase the EITC you receive, because the tax code does not recognize unemployment income as earned income. And if you have received unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic, you may owe taxes on that income. Check with your tax preparer to make sure.  Being unemployed in 2020 may reduce the EITC you receive. Knowing exactly how unemployment income will affect your EITC depends upon your specific circumstances.  How to calculate your exact EITC  To calculate precise numbers, use the  IRS EITC Assistant . To use this tool, you’ll need to know your income and your tax withholding or taxes paid. You’ll also have to know any expenses or adjustments to your income that may occur. Having your prior year tax return available may be helpful.  Another option is to find a 2020 EITC calculator online. Just be aware, not all calculators differentiate between different types of income. So if you do have earned income and unemployment, they may not give an accurate number, depending on what side of the EITC “curve” you are on.  It’s a lot of information, and there are many nuances, but knowing these details will help you maximize your tax return. Knowing helps planning, and planning helps you have better finances.

{"prompt":"Why isn’t my credit score improving?","completion":" I’ve been paying my bills every month on time and nothing changes on Credit Karma. I feel like I’m stalking the app. What should I do?  Submitted by Michelle S.  Congrats on paying your bills on time! Can we just celebrate that for a moment?  What Impacts Your Credit Score  Paying your bills will not reflect your credit score unless those bills are payments on your loans. Utility bills are not reported on a credit report unless you don’t pay for a long time and they get sent to collections.  Improving your credit score can take time, so determine if checking frequently is good for you emotionally. Each credit bureau has their “secret sauce” of how they calculate your credit score, taking in multiple factors (not just payment) to reach the final number.   How to Use Credit Karma  Credit Karma is a tool to help you monitor your score and items that are reported to Transunion and Equifax. The credit reporting agencies ultimately are the companies that lenders report to, and how they do so affects your score.  Credit Karma may offer suggestions for banking products that could help you, but be careful with these. The products they refer are their way of getting paid. That’s how the app is free for members (if an app is free, you are the product). If you want to use the information that Credit Karma gives you to improve your credit and FICO score, check out  these tips .  History Matters Too  It is equally important, or even more important, to show good history on your report. When you establish a pattern of paying what you owe, financial institutions take this into consideration regardless of your score.  Your credit score drives your interest rate, but your history will ultimately determine if a financial institution will approve you for a loan. If your report is clean and accurate, your score will rise as you pay your credit accounts on time.

{"prompt":"The Saver’s Credit: Are You Double Dipping on Tax Savings?","completion":" How Do Tax-Advantaged Accounts Work?  When you contribute to a retirement account like an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) or a qualified employer-sponsored retirement plan (like a 401K), you receive a tax advantage. If the account is a traditional account, you may be able to reduce your taxable income for the current year. However, you’ll pay taxes when you withdraw them in retirement. If the account is a Roth, you won’t be taxed on those funds when you withdraw them in retirement. Both types of accounts can grow tax free. And for both accounts, withdrawing funds “early” (before retirement if they aren’t qualified withdrawals) can result in a tax penalty.  The tax advantages of these accounts can really be helpful in building up money for retirement. Which of these accounts is best for you depends on your specific tax and income situation, and your personal preferences.   What is the Retirement Savings Contribution Credit?  For some of us, we can actually double dip on tax savings for retirement. Not only can we get the tax advantages, but we can get the Saver’s Credit as well. This credit is called the “Retirement Savings Contributions Credit.” It’s designed to encourage people to invest money into retirement accounts. You may be able to take this credit for making eligible contributions to your IRA or employer-sponsored retirement plan.  See If You Qualify for the Retirement Savings Contribution Credit  If you use tax software and contribute to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, it should be checking if you qualify. Just make sure you enter the letters and numbers from Box 12 of your W-2 in the software. The more money you earn, the less you get for this credit until it phases out entirely. The maximum credit is $2,000 for Married Filing Joint and $1,000 for all other filers. The maximum contribution that can be used in the calculation is $4,000 for Married Filing Jointly and $2,000 for all other filers. Whether or not you qualify is based on your Adjusted Gross Income, as shown in the chart below for tax year 2020. Also, you must be 18 years of age or older, not a student (generally speaking), and not someone else’s dependent.  2020 Retirement Savings Contribution Credit Amounts   *Single, married filing separately, or qualifying widow(er)  An Example of the Retirement Savings Contribution Credit  If you are single with an Adjusted Gross Income of $20,000 and you contributed $2,000 to your employer sponsored 401K, your credit would be 20% of $2,000. So you would receive a tax credit of $400. Please note that this credit is not refundable. This means if you’ve already reduced your tax liability to zero through deductions and other credits, you won’t receive the benefit of this credit.   There aren’t many opportunities for “double dipping” tax savings in our tax code. If you can take advantage of this one, it can help you improve your finances. But just like other credits and deductions that you may take, make sure that it fits both your financial and tax situation before investing to get this credit.

{"prompt":"What is the Rule of 72?","completion":" Are you considering investing money? If so, you should know about the Rule of 72. It helps you determine how long it will take for your money to grow a certain amount. The Rule of 72 allows you to figure out how long it will take for an investment to double at a given annual rate of return. You can also use it to determine the interest rate you need to find on your investment to have your money double in a certain period of time.  How to Use the Rule of 72  The formula for the Rule of 72 is:    Time = 72/ Interest Rate  In this formula:  Time is the years for the investment to double Interest Rate is the annual rate of return  Rule of 72 Examples  Here is an example of how to apply the Rule of 72. You want to invest $500 at a 6% interest rate. So, it will take your $500 twelve years to double and reach $1,000.  Time = 72 / 6 Time = 12 years  Now let’s look at using the Rule of 72 to determine the interest rate you would need to find in order for your investment to double in a certain time.  You want your investment to double five years from now.  What interest rate does your investment need to earn to make this happen?  5 = 72/Interest Rate Interest Rate = 72 / 5 Interest Rate = 14.4%  Your investment would need to grow at 14.4% annually to reach your goal of doubling in five years.  When to Use the Rule of 72  There are many different calculators and Excel operations that allow you to determine the time it will take for an investment to grow to a certain level. The Rule of 72 is still good to know. It offers a simple way for determining how long it will take an investment to double.  And the neat thing about the Rule of 72 is that it can be used in other areas of personal finance as well. You can use it to find out how often the cost of something is doubling if the cost increases at a constant annual rate. You can also use it to determine how quickly inflation will decrease the value of your savings by half. The Rule of 72 is both simple and useful and allows you to think about changes in your investments and costs in a more concrete way.

{"prompt":"What is private mortgage insurance?","completion":" If you get a conventional loan and make a down payment of less than 20 percent of the home price, you are required to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI). PMI protects the lender (not you) in case you fail to make your mortgage payments.  Banks, savings associations, credit unions, and mortgage companies make conventional loans to creditworthy borrowers at interest rates based on market conditions. The federal government does not insure these loans.  It’s important to note that PMI pays for losses that a lender has because of foreclosure. It protects the lender in case you default on the loan. It will not pay your mortgage loan payments.  How does private mortgage insurance work?  PMI has an annual premium. This premium is divided by 12 in the form of a monthly charge added to your mortgage payment of principal, interest, (property) taxes, and (property) insurance (PITI). Even though you’re the one paying, PMI is protection for the lender in case you default on the loan.  How much does private mortgage insurance cost?  The cost of PMI varies. Generally, borrowers who are a higher credit risk (lower credit score) pay higher fees for private mortgage insurance.  When can I stop paying for private mortgage insurance?  PMI is automatically canceled when your mortgage balance reaches 78 percent of the original value of the house. However, there are exceptions. If you have a high-risk loan, have not been current on your payments, or have other liens on your property, your PMI may continue. You can also cancel your PMI through written request – with the exceptions listed above – when you reach 20% equity in your home based on the original property value.

{"prompt":"The Three C’s of Credit","completion":" When applying for a loan, it’s helpful to know what your Loan Officer will be looking at when making his or her decision. There are three areas they will review: Capacity, Collateral, and Character.  Capacity  Capacity is simply your ability to repay the loan. They will review your monthly income and expenses to determine if you can afford to make the monthly payments. They will consider open lines of credit as well. If you were to max out all the lines of credit available to you, would you still be able to make the payment or would you be over-extended?  Collateral  Next is collateral. Do you have something of value that you can use as collateral? Essentially you would be saying, “If I don’t pay this loan, you can take this piece of property and sell it to pay off the remaining balance.” For example, for a mortgage loan, your home is the collateral, and for a car loan, your car is the collateral. The lender may determine the amount they are willing to lend you based on what they think the collateral is worth. In other words, you can’t borrow $200,000 on a house valued at $75,000.  An un-secured loan is a loan without collateral. The lender is offering the loan strictly on the value of your good name.    Character  Third is character. The lender will review your credit history to see how you’ve handled debts in the past. Did you pay on time every month and pay the debt in full? Or did you settle any of the debt or declare bankruptcy? These questions aid in revealing how you are likely to handle debt in the future.  Keep these three C’s in mind if you plan on doing any borrowing in the future.  You will want to present your best self to your loan officer. "}

{"prompt":"How do you balance debt and savings? Here’s what our research found.","completion":"If you’re paying down debt, saving money may be a low priority for you. After all, you’re probably paying interest on your debt every month, so paying off your debt more quickly means keeping more money in your pocket long-term.  It’s harder to save when you have debt  Our research found that Savers with a very good or excellent credit score (the two highest categories) were more likely to save at least $20/month than Savers with lower credit scores. Savers who had no debt or a manageable amount of debt were also more likely to save.   What do the experts say?  Many experts believe that maintaining or building a small emergency fund is crucial even if you have debt. SaverLife’s Financial Coach Saundra Davis agrees. She says many people ask her, “Should I save or pay down my debt?” Her recommendation is  a balanced approach . Focus on paying down debt, but don’t eliminate saving entirely. "}
{"prompt":"Allison’s Story: No Such Thing as Over-Prepared","completion":" Meet Allison, a Data Analyst who lives in Winooski, Vermont with her three roommates.  What do you do?  I am the Manager of Data Analytics for a home health and hospice agency. I’ve been here for a year and a half, and really love my job. I have a lot of autonomy, and I get to make a lot of my own decisions and am treated with respect.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My parents divorced when I was in second grade, so I essentially grew up in two different households. I was seeing one method from my mother and nothing from my father. What I saw from my mother was what I thought was good at the time because the lights never went out and we always had cable. As I got older, I realized she was juggling bills. She was paying only some bills every month and was barely keeping things afloat. This meant we rarely had extra money.  A byproduct of this is that when we did have extra money, we thought, “We should do something with this.”  When I was on my own financially, I didn’t know it was bad practice to not have money the day before payday. I always thought it was okay to be right down to the penny before you got paid the next day. It’s taken a lot of work to get away from that. Things like buying an extra pair of shoes or going out one last time right before my next paycheck hit my bank account seemed normal.  What is your proudest financial achievement?  I was gifted $5,000 in 2011 that I used as a down payment on a condo, which cost $87,000. Given that I had just graduated from grad school, this was a blessing. I spent the next six years living there and slowly fixing it. I was able to sell it for a $75,000 profit. It wasn’t just that I bought it at the right time at 2011 and sold in 2017 at top of market. I also made smart choices when I was renovating it. The condo needed new paint flooring and countertops, but there were no issues with the furnace or plumbing. I was able to take the money I earned from my fixer upper project and buy a house. I was able to get many, many returns on that initial gift.  Allison receiving the keys to her condo  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  It’s cliché, but “live within your means.” More specifically, look at where you’re spending. Figure out what you’re spending versus what you’re bringing in.  How do you apply that financial advice to your life?  I like to budget. I usually keep a one-page monthly calendar of what I need to pay. Sometimes I still struggle paycheck to paycheck, so I look at my payday dates and make sure that I’m paying all my bills. Then I look at what optional spending I might have at any given time. I forecast out my budget for a year at a time. I look at what regular bills I have and what other expenses I can anticipate, and that allows me to see if and when I’m going to be short on cash. It allows me to plan projects for my house as well. I find that when I have a plan for money, I do better with my money than when I don’t.  How do you juggle your multiple incomes?  I own the house and I have roommates who pay me monthly. One roommate pays bi-weekly, which works best for them. I also have a side job  doing billing for a physical therapy practice. I take those hours and trade them in for a massage. It’s a great deal!  What are your goals for the future?  In the short term, I have some medical bills that I’m trying to pay off. My end goal is to have a reserve that could help me cover $2,000 or more in case of things like medical bills. I want to be better prepared to handle those kinds of situations.  I also want to learn how to be better at saving. I’m good at it when there’s something I’m saving for like a dress, but I’m really bad at saving money long-term.  I still have student loans that I’m trying to pay off. I use the app EarnUp for my mortgage, car loan, and student loan because it pays you bi-weekly instead of once a month. It’s helping me pay off my loans faster.  My ultimate goal is to be debt free and just live on cash. I also hope to pay my car off with EarnUp and put that money in a bank. It means I’ll be buying a good second-hand car that will get me to where I need to go. I also want to continue to not have credit card debt.   Allison participated in SaverLife through a partnership with the United Way of NW Vermont and local employers. This pilot project was possible thanks to funding from the FINRA Foundation. "}

{"prompt":"How to Figure Out Your Voting Plan","completion":" Your vote matters. Candidates you elect support policies and laws — and sometimes, help dismantle systemic barriers — that directly impact your financial security. Voting is one of the most important ways you can influence policies and laws and help determine who represents your interests in government.   Your vote is just as powerful as any billionaire’s. Especially in a time when there’s so much at stake, your vote doesn’t just work — it matters.      But your vote only counts if you manage to vote! Once you’ve registered to vote, you need a voting plan. Studies have shown that people who plan out their voting day in advance are more likely to take action and cast their vote.   Read on for a quick outline of what your plan should include.  1. Where is your polling place?  If you’re planning to cast your vote in person, you’ll need to know where your local polling place is located. Every registered voter in the U.S. has an assigned physical polling place, and that location can change from year to year.  To find your assigned polling place, check the Vote.org list of state polling place locators below. Once you choose your state, you may have to enter some personal information in order to receive polling place details.  Check my polling place  Alternately, call your state or local election office.  Find your election office here.  2. What are your polling place’s hours?  Don’t assume your polling place will be open when it’s convenient for you to go. Check the voting hours at your specific polling place. Then make a plan for when you’re going to get there on Election Day. Will you vote on your way to work in the morning? On your lunch break? After you pick up the kids at school? And importantly, do you need to ask for time off in advance in order to make it to your polling place?  3. How are you going to get to the polls?  Knowing how you’re going to get to your polling place is an important piece of the puzzle. If you have a reliable car and plan to drive, great. If you can walk, take public transportation, ride a bike, or skateboard, that’s great too.   But if none of these alternatives are options for you, you’ll need another plan. Here are a few suggestions:  If you’re in a major city with ridesharing options, note that  Lyft ,  Uber , and  Lime  are all planning initiatives to support voters getting to the polls.  Carpool with neighbors, perhaps by connecting on a service link  NextDoor . This is also a great way to encourage others to vote! Certain local organizations and volunteer services make a point to mobilize and help voters in need get to the polls. Look for information in your local newspaper or via a Google search.  4. What are you going to bring?  Voter ID laws vary from state to state. Some states require you to show a valid photo I.D. from a list of official options. Others will accept a bill with your name and address on it, and some don’t require any ID at all. Make sure you know what’s expected at your polling place.   Check your ID requirements  5. Who and what are you going to vote for?  Here’s the hardest part. How will you vote?   It’s tough to find nonpartisan information these days. One resource is BallotReady, which explains every candidate and referendum in as objective terms as possible.   By entering your street address, you can see a full breakdown of which candidates you’ll be able to vote for in the next election. By drilling down to a particular candidate, you’ll see that person’s credentials, as well as their voting record and stance on issues such as abortion, civil rights, criminal justice, healthcare, housing immigration — and even coronavirus.   See voting options  6. What else can happen?  Having a plan for Election Day is so important. But what if something goes wrong? What if you get to the polls in time, but there’s a long line, and the poll is scheduled to close before you get  to the front? What if you experience intimidation or harassment at your polling place — or you’re told that you’re not on the voter roll, even though you’re sure you registered to vote?  Vote.org has a great resource on  Election Protection . It addresses all of these scenarios and more. If you have a smartphone you plan to take with you to the polls, consider bookmarking the page. Alternatively, review the information in advance and either print it out or commit to memory.

{"prompt":"Tiffany’s Story: Leaving a Legacy for her Family","completion":" Meet Tiffany, a multi-business entrepreneur who lives in New York.   Tell me about the work you do.  Well, I’m disabled, but I don’t let that get the best of me. In fact, right now I run four businesses: childcare services, Legalshield, Herbalife, and Blast Ave with my business partner, Helen.   I want to buy a house and leave a legacy for my family, and that’s why I’m working so hard.  What does a day in your life currently look like?   It changes day-by-day, but today I was busy driving around New York running errands: going to doctor’s appointments, picking up my grandkids, checking in on my Legalshield business, taking care of my pets, and going to meetings. It’s usually late by the time I get home.   I always have something to do. For example, I’m helping a friend get her business off the ground.   Have you received any or all of the stimulus payments?  I don’t remember receiving the first one, but the second and third ones went toward paying my bills for those months.    What do budgeting and saving look like for you?  I know how to pay myself first. Every time I receive my paycheck, I try to save at least $100 in my savings account. Actually, the only reason I got to that amount was because of the  Race to $100 .  The  Race to $100 savings challenge  motivates me and keeps me coming back to SaverLife. If I make more money in a given month, I try to put that toward my savings goal.   I read all the  Money 101 articles , too. They’re short and sweet and keep me informed.   Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  My biggest achievement was when I was able to finally pay off my bills. I was so excited not to have any debt!   And at my lowest, my kids crashed the car that I had just paid off, and I had to finance a new car.   How did you find SaverLife?  I found SaverLife through Dress for Success! They had a class and helped me with finding business clothes for work, and they shared SaverLife as well. As I looked more into the program, I discovered just how much SaverLife had to offer.  "}
{"prompt":"Josh’s Story: Trouble Affording the Basic Necessities","completion":" Meet Josh, who’s currently disabled and living with his wife in Oregon City, Oregon.  Where do you live?  I live in Oregon City in a low-income apartment. Compared to when I first moved in, nothing has really changed except now the economy is different.  In our email communication, you mentioned that you’re disabled. Has the coronavirus impacted your everyday life?   My wife stays at home and I do the shopping. I call her when I’m at the store, then send pictures of what’s available. Depending on how much I have to pick up, I take my foldable cart.   Personally, I fall in the “at risk” category because I’m Type 2 diabetic and disabled. I feel cheated out when I go to the stores and try to buy things for my household. Because my wife and I don’t have a car, I have to walk to the stores. The three closest grocery stores within walking distance are the Grocery Outlet, Safeway, and Frey Meyers.  It’s harder for people with no car. Most places here you need a car because buses don’t cut it. For instance, you can’t even get fast food because they only do drive through. It kind of seems discriminatory. I honestly feel discriminated against that I can’t do things like that, even more so now because of coronavirus.  What’s your financial situation been like recently?  We had to borrow some money. We’re lucky enough that we were able to borrow the money or we’d be out of luck. My wife and I have been doing online shopping on Walmart because they offer free shipping on orders $35 or more. The only downside is the stores aren’t keeping up with the demand and nothing is being restocked in time.  It was really hard for my wife to find work even before this whole coronavirus thing. In this time of crisis, there’s no way to save. I only get $783 a month from disability. Thank goodness I only pay $127 a month for rent. I also get food stamps, which helps. But every time my disability paycheck goes up, my food stamps go down.  Have you notice any significant changes when trying to purchase items online?  I noticed someone was selling cans of Lysol for over $500 on eBay. This is how I’m learning how hard the virus has hit the US. The prices online are racked up because they’re essentials. I’ve even seen a single can of Lysol going for $50. Luckily enough, I bought a 144oz container of Pine-Sol a while back. I looked online recently, and it was out of stock.  What’s it like being on food stamps at a time like this?  I get them on the 2nd of every month, but I’ve still got to fork out cash for us to last until next month.  Do you think your life will be different when the pandemic is over?  I don’t know if it’ll be significantly different, but I imagine that I’d be able to find things on the shelves. Right now, by the time I get paid, it’s gone.  Life could be more normal right now if we had better policies in place such as not being allowed to hoard things or setting a maximum that you’re allowed to buy of some items. Stores have to be stricter with these things. They need to have the national guard in these stores to make sure people are getting what they’re supposed to be getting. Everybody needs something. If you’ve got all the soap, how are other people supposed to wash up?  It makes me tear up to hear stores opening up an hour early for elderly and immunocompromised to get stuff they need. When I go there, it’s empty. Also, our truck drivers are busting their butts to get us what we need, but people keep hoarding it. "}
{"prompt":"Christy’s Story: Grandparents are the Gifts That Keep on Giving","completion":" Meet Christy, the director of nursing at a nursing home who lives with her husband and three daughters in South Carolina.  What’s your household like these days?  With daughters, it’s tears and laughter and glitter 24/7. Things have certainly been different since the girls started virtual school, but we’re getting used to it.   On a typical day, I wake up at 6am and get the girls up and fed. By 7:50am they’re online doing virtual school, and that’s around the time I head to work. My husband works nights, so I make sure he’s situated before I leave for the day. Depending on the day, I usually work 8-10 hours, maybe go home to eat lunch with my family, go back to work, and then I come home for supper. Then I go to bed and start over again the next day.  My girls are in kindergarten, third grade, and fourth grade. It’s been a learning curve for all of us for sure. With my oldest daughter, school isn’t her forte, but there are less distractions at home so she can concentrate more. My middle child is what I like to call the “little mother” because she helps our youngest with anything she needs. My husband and I have done our best to be proactive and help our kids learn, and we’re in constant communication with their teachers.  We’re also lucky that their great grandmother is still in our lives. She loves teaching the girls new skills just as much as they love learning from her.   It sounds like your grandparents are a big part of your life. Could you tell me more about them?   They’re 81 and 85 years old. They helped me make my way through my nursing school. My grandma was kind enough to help me study and I like to joke that she should’ve gotten a degree in nursing alongside me. She’s also taught one of my daughters how to knit and another one how to cook.   My grandpa loves music. He’s trying to get each of the girls to pick an instrument they want to play. He recently bought them an electric keyboard.   I don’t know what I would do or where I would be without them.  What do you and your family do to relax?   We’re really trying to unplug more. When I’m home, we try to do outdoor activities. For example, my girls wanted to plant a garden this year. We failed miserably, but there’s always next time. All my daughters like to read, so we’re reading  Charlotte’s Web  at the moment.   What’s it like with you working during the day and your husband working at night?  We make it work. My husband was unemployed for about five months after the COVID-19 pandemic hit. There were a lot of jobs he was supposed to do that just got postponed or canceled.    As for me, my job is more demanding and difficult than ever. We’re busier and stretched thinner these days. There are more precautions we’re taking like screening everyone who comes in, taking their temperatures, and wearing masks. I used to work in a long-term care facility before this. It’s especially tough for the residents because the facility isn’t allowing visitors.  Are you shopping during this holiday season?   We’re shopping for immediate family only this year. Trying to plan what holiday gatherings will look like this year has been hectic, but we’re lucky that the majority of my family lives in town. We did a virtual Thanksgiving with my cousin in New York, and hopefully him and his wife can quarantine themselves and join us for Christmas this year. We’re still playing it by ear.  I’ve talked with my girls about what gifts might look like this year. It’ll be tighter than normal but we’ll make it work. They’ve been really wanting Nerf guns, and my husband and I may have to splurge and get two for ourselves so we can join in on the fun, too.   What does saving money look like?  We had a house fire a couple years ago that we’re still trying to build back from. It was a big ordeal. We eliminated our savings trying to recover from that. In the last couple of years, we managed to build our savings a little, but after my husband lost his job earlier this year, we had to use what savings we had left in our emergency fund to stay afloat. Right now, I’m just trying to re-establish our savings. I’m hoping we won’t have to spend money to repair our car within the next five years.  Recently, I set up an Acorns account and tried to squirrel away a bit of money there.   What would you like to do when things get better?  I think that we’d all really enjoy a trip out of state. My grandparents really want to go to California. We’ve never traveled outside of the South, so that’d be a fun vacation to take.  Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  Not going bankrupt when my husband lost his job and managing to keep out of the red as best I could. You have to appreciate where you are. Without understanding what trials you’ve had, you can’t fully enjoy your triumph.  My goal is to have a nice retirement account and set up a fund for my girls’ college expenses.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I was on Google searching for resources to help us when my husband was unemployed and that’s how I found SaverLife. SaverLife introduced me to Steady, too. I love the articles and I’ve enjoyed  earning points for doing activities . I even  won $5 once  which was really exciting! I think SaverLife is a wonderful resource for anybody that  doesn’t know where to start with saving or is struggling with saving . Right now, people need help in a loving and kind way. "}
{"prompt":"Destiny’s Story: Prioritizing Her Family’s Financial Security","completion":" Meet Destiny, a customer service representative who lives with her four children in Virginia.   How’s it been sheltering in place?  It’s just me and my four boys here at home. Sheltering in place was much harder when it first began. Now that things are starting to reopen and I’m going back to work, it’s becoming a little easier. It can get overwhelming at times, but we’re making it through.  What does a day in your life currently look like?  I wake up, get ready for work, get the kids ready for daycare, work for six hours, pick the kids up, come home and cook dinner, put the kids to bed, then go to sleep and start all over again the next day.  What’s your profession?  I just started as a customer service representative at a call center in July. It’s been good so far, and I’m glad to be at work. Sitting at home every day wasn’t great for me and my boys.  My hours changed just a bit, but I’m lucky that I got to pick when I work. I work 9am to 3pm, so I schedule what I have to do for my kids outside my working hours.  How are your kids attending school this year?   I have two kids that are school-aged and two that go to daycare. The two that are in school are doing virtual learning. It’s the first time they’re learning this way, so it’s going to be an interesting school year. It’s a lot different compared to what we’re used to.  I can already tell it’s going to be tough having the kids at home 24/7 and being their teacher while working full-time as well. Even though it’s a challenge, it’s nothing I can’t handle. Hopefully, we can get into the groove of things and get some type of routine going.   Any long-term savings goals?  My main thing is saving for a house. Besides that, I’m saving for a rainy day. You never know what’s going to happen.  How do you envision your family’s future?  I want to buy a house for myself and my kids. I’d like to have a car that’s paid for that I’m not making payments on. I want to have something that I own that I don’t have to worry about being taken away. Eventually, I want to get married. Lastly, I just want my family to be financially stable and have a career.  I don’t want my kids to have to want for anything. Most of the time, I’m living paycheck-to-paycheck, but I want to build financial security for my family.   What does financial security mean to you?  It means having a well-funded savings account. A lot of times, I’ve had to ask my family members for money to pay for things or get gas, and I want to be able to provide for my kids without asking for help.  Do you talk to your kids about money?  They have to do chores in order to earn their allowance. I want them to grow up and understand the value of money. If I just give them money, they’ll keep expecting it without having earned it. I don’t want them thinking people are entitled to have money given to them.  I don’t think I had much guidance when it came to money management growing up, so a lot of what I’ve had to do and learn, I taught myself. I just want to make sure I teach my boys everything about finances so it’s not difficult for them growing up.  What would you like to do after this is all over?  I want to take my kids on a vacation. It’s something we try to do every year, and because of COVID-19, we weren’t able to this year. I just want for them to see and explore new places.  Going to the beach first would be my priority. My 4-year-old has been talking about the beach for some time now, and I really want to be able to take him there. That’s something he’s looking forward to.   What does saving and budgeting look like for you?  I haven’t actually been saving lately. Before I started working again in July, I had to count dimes and watch my family’s spending. Since I’m back to work now, I want to start saving $30 per paycheck.   When I put my budget together, I prefer to write it out using pen and paper. I like to see the amounts in front of me. Nothing against the mobile apps, I just prefer to do budgeting myself.   Writing it down makes me feel like I’ll remember it better, too.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I love it! I try to get on the site at least once a week. The  forums  and  articles  are really helpful since I’m working on my financial security.  "}

{"prompt":"How do you use your tax refund?","completion":"Every month, part of your paycheck is sent straight to the government to pay your taxes. But at the end of the year, most people owe less than they’ve already paid – so they get money back from the government. These tax refunds are a huge influx of money for many American families.  If you’re struggling to save every month, your tax refund can be a great way to get started. After all, without knowing it, you’ve been putting away money every month that you can’t touch! Even if you already have a plan for your tax refund, putting some of it into savings can go a long way.  How Savers Used Their Refunds  SaverLife Savers received an average of $3,464 in refunds in 2018. Here’s how they said they used that money:   As you may have noticed, these numbers add up to more than 100%. Savers often told us they used their refunds for multiple goals.  One Saver named Rocio told us, “My tax refund is a blessing because I can tell my son that I am able to pay his school classes and education.” Another Saver named Cortney said, “I wanted to save my tax refund, but I had to have some car repairs done, so most of my tax refund went toward that.” "}
{"prompt":"What does saving mean to you?","completion":"At SaverLife, we talk a lot about how important it is to save. But defining what it means to save is surprisingly difficult!  Consider this scenario: You transfer $5 from your checking to savings account every week all year. At the end of the year, your car needs some repairs. You withdraw all the money you’ve saved to pay for car repairs. It’s a necessary expense, but it’s still depleted your savings. Have you saved this year?  There is no right answer to this. Some people say yes, this is saving because you had the  habit  of saving money. But other people say no, this is not saving because the  balance  in your savings account is the same as it was a year ago.  It comes down to this: Is saving a behavior or a balance?  Saving for Soon  Earlier this year, we ran a campaign called Savers Win, where SaverLife members pledged to save their tax refunds and won prizes. If you participated in Savers Win, you may have answered a survey from us about whether you actually did save your refund.  When we looked at at your answers, we noticed that people were describing the same behavior in different ways. For example, one Saver told us that she saved her tax refund to pay for an updated glasses prescription. Another Saver told us that she ended up not being able to save her refund – because she bought new glasses!   If you’re trying to start saving, how do you define saving? How do you know whether you’ve been successful at saving this month – your savings balance or the behavior of saving regularly? "}

{"prompt":"Meet Derkisha, SaverLife’s $5,000 Grand Prize Winner","completion":" Derkisha is a SaverLife member, a nursing school student, and a mother of five. She was one of over 45,000 people who pledged to save their tax refunds with SaverLife, collectively pledging to save more than $60 million.  The SaverLife team traveled to Texas to surprise Derkisha with the news that she was our Grand Prize winner and won $5,000. See what happened!     Right now, Derkisha and her children are living in a temporary home. “I’ve made it our home and it looks like ours,” she says, “but it’s not permanent. That’s what I want for my kids and myself.”  “I’ve had my ups and downs,” Derkisha says. “But I’m proud of how much I’ve grown. I want to work to improve myself and my life.”  Derkisha is currently getting her degree in nursing. When she graduates and starts working, her goal is to buy some land and build her “forever home” – a home where her kids can play and be safe, and come back to when they are older. The $5,000 will go straight into savings so that she can make that dream a reality. "}
{"prompt":"Michelle’s Story: Happiness Is Contagious","completion":" Meet Michelle, a former health insurance agent who lives with her two granddaughters in Wisconsin.  What’s it like where you live?  I grew up in Wisconsin and I’ve been here for 52 years. I have a 33-year-old son who doesn’t live with me, but I’m taking care of my two teenage granddaughters, so that’s who’s in my house. The youngest has been with me for eight years, and her older sister has lived with us on and off for the last three years. It’s nice getting to raise kids again!  Do you currently have a profession?  Right now, I’m not working. I’m waiting to receive disability benefits. When I was in the workforce, I sold health insurance for 25 years.  What does a day in your life currently look like during the COVID-19 shelter-in-place?   I’m constantly running errands because I take care of my mom and my aunt, who both have onset dementia. They’re always asking questions like, “Where are we going?” or “Are we there yet?” They’re a handful. These days, I have to take them to their various appointments while also balancing homeschooling my two grandchildren. I’ve also had my physical therapy appointments canceled on top of all of that.  I have a full-time schedule taking care of my mom, aunt, and two grandchildren. My sister has bronchitis and pneumonia, so I drop off groceries to her house when I can. Plus, I have three dogs that I take care of. They keep me busy. They always want to go outside to play fetch, and they love to go in and out of the house every ten minutes.  Has your life changed in the past few weeks?  Our town is on lockdown like everywhere else. Only the essential places are open, like grocery stores. The stores are even limiting the amount of people who can go in. We live in the city, and all the big businesses and malls around us are closed. It’s very strange.   Most of our normal doctors’ appointments have been canceled, and everything has been put on hold. I had a surgery that was supposed to happen, but it’s been postponed.   I try to order carry out from a local restaurant for my mom and my aunt when I can, and I only run errands for them once a week to help them out. The local restaurants offer a limited menu these days, and some are only open for three to four hours for carry out. I want to help support our community since most of the restaurants and bars around us are run by small business owners.  How have your finances been these past weeks?  At this point, they’re pretty bad. I just terminated my lease for my vehicle. I’ve also been trying to file for disability since 2016. I previously filed, but I needed to redo it, and it’s a lengthy process. Since I haven’t been able to work, I’ve been living off my retirement money, but I’ve had to pay 35% in withdrawal fees since I’m not of age to withdraw without penalties. Since my granddaughters live with me, I get $500 from kinship, but it’s not much. During the summer, I have rummage sales to make ends meet. I’ve sold my pool table, my boat—everything I’ve worked for. Anything I could sell, I did.  Nowadays, I take surveys and participate in online research groups to make money and get my bills paid. I use Energy Assistance to help me with my energy bill, and it’s been turned off in the summer before. I’m also on the Food Share Program, which has helped a bit. At this point, everything is month to month, and I pay down whatever I can come up with.  On top of all that, I can’t afford to pay my credit cards off. I have three liens against me. It costs $2,500 to file for bankruptcy, and I can’t even afford to do that.   Are you hoping disability pay could bring some financial relief?  If I could receive the amount my case managers estimated, that would really help. In addition to the disability pay, if I could also receive my social security award letter, I could imagine myself getting by financially.   I was told recently that because the social security offices are closed, everything is on hold. They’re not going to take my new case since it was re-filed in February. Most likely, my case managers said that I probably won’t get back pay. It’s all up in the air right now. It might not be until the end of the year that I hear anything back.    Are you also financially supporting my mom and aunt?  Fortunately, they receive their social security checks since they’re both older now.   How are you feeling about your situation right now?  I try not to stress about things too much. I’ll get random checks in the mail from either a class action lawsuit cases from seven years ago or rebates from items I’ve previously purchased. I pray that a higher power keeps me afloat until I can get back on track. I’m always taking care of everyone else. I’d have so much more money if I only had to worry about myself. I try not to let it get to me.  Usually, my tax refund will be around $2,000. I divide that by 12 months, and that money each month helps me pay off my bills.   What would you like to do once things go back to normal?  I’m actually peaceful and I enjoy not having to run, run, run all the time. It’s nice to not have my days super filled with errands all day long. I don’t get to do much anyways since I don’t have the money in the first place.  However, I am looking forward to going to state and county fairs and festivals again because they’re inexpensive to attend. I’m not too anxious to go into the rat race of a world just yet. I enjoy having this time to myself.   Earlier this week, I was just talking to someone else about things shutting down. I think about my mom and aunt who can’t leave their rooms, the elderly, single people living alone—they have it much worse. At least I can do dishes on my own or go in my backyard.   I hope this is a big wake up call for all of us. We need to understand what’s superficial and what’s important in life. We’re all in this together.   I just want to be around positive energy these days. Negativity is draining. If you’re smiling and laughing, you get through life so much better.   How do you feel about SaverLife?  It’s a nice incentive. Getting little deposits here and there helps when you are struggling. Every bit helps. "}
{"prompt":"Tax refunds are used for bills, healthcare, and – yes – having some fun!","completion":"Last month, we talked about  how Savers used their 2017 tax refunds . This month, we’re diving deeper into how saving and spending changed after Savers got their refunds.  Refunds are used to play catch-up  In the months leading up to tax season, many people have to put off bills or delay healthcare. We learned that Savers used their refunds to cover those delayed expenses, like medical bills, government expenses (like renewing a DMV license or paying a parking ticket), credit card payments, and utilities.  Here’s how people’s spending changed in February (after receiving tax refunds) compared to the prior three months.   One Saver named Sanjay told us that his tax refund “helped me clear a major chunk of my credit card debt.”  Refunds allow people to enjoy some well-earned fun  Savers also used their refunds to have fun! For some, this was going to the movies or a museum; for others, this was investing in their health with a gym membership.   It’s important to put some of your money toward things that you enjoy and that are meaningful to you. And even though discretionary spending increased in February, it still accounts for only around 1% of spending.  People are also saving their refunds!  People who received a tax refund in February increased the amount of money they transferred to a savings account by 191%.  On average, this comes out to $1,296 saved per person, meaning that people are saving almost  half  of their refunds. Way to go, Savers! "}
{"prompt":"Aaliyah’s Story: A Pharmacy Technician in the Making","completion":" Meet Aaliyah, a single mother of three who’s studying to become a pharmacy technician and nail technician and lives in North Carolina.  How do you like living in Raleigh?  I’ve been back here for about four years. I’m originally from Portsmouth, Virginia.   I moved to Raleigh when I was little, then I went to Virginia because I had friends down there. I found my way back to North Carolina when my family moved back. I just wanted to be closer to family.   Right now, it’s just me and my three children. They’re five months, seven, and eight.  What’s your profession?  I’m going to school to become a pharmacy technician. I also want to be a nail technician, so I’m going to school for both. My classes are all online, but I haven’t registered for fall classes just yet.  Are you working outside of going to school?  I’m employed with Etic Labor, and I do temporary work, housekeeping, warehouse work—things like that. The job I’m doing isn’t a career-building job; it’s just a job to make money.  How is your family coping with what’s going on?  Since the lockdowns started, I’m pretty much at home with the kids either cooking or cleaning. I keep them in the house, away from the virus.   My daughter likes karaoke and watching TikTok videos, and my son is into playing PlayStation games.   How are your kids going to be attending school in the fall?  I’m a little bit nervous that my kids are going to be going to school from home. I’m not too good at teaching. I don’t feel like I’m patient enough to do it, but I feel like it’s the safer thing to do, away from other kids. The kids at school aren’t washing their hands as much as they need to.  Neither my daughter or son are happy about the situation. They don’t understand why they can’t physically go back to school. My daughter is missing her friends and her teacher. I think this is going to become the new normal because of this virus.  What would you like to do after this is all over?  I’m taking my kids on a vacation because I know they’re tired of being cooped up in the house all day. Though it’s hard to say right now where we’d go. It’s hard to plan future trips when you don’t know how things are going to be after all this.  Are you saving for anything in the long-term?  I want to start my own nail tech business. Also, I’m looking to buy a home and I want somewhere stable for my kids to be—somewhere they can call their own. I’ve been looking at homes in North Carolina since it’s so close to family.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  Yes, a lot more than usual. I have a real hard time saving. And even when I save, I find something to spend the money on. I think about all the times I should’ve saved but spent money on unnecessary things like clothes, nails, lashes, or wigs.  What does saving mean to you in your life?  It means saving in case a rainy day comes. But you should save anyway because that’s the better thing to do. With me, I have kids, and I want to be prepared for anything that comes our way. "}

{"prompt":"JoTerrica’s Story: Veteran, Student, and Mother","completion":" Meet JoTerrica, a disabled veteran who is working on her Master’s in Social Work. She lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico with her children and partner.  What do you do?  I am a full-time student, I am a mother, and I am a Recreation Aide at my local VA. I served in the military from 2005 until March 2015. When I was 17 and a junior in high school, I started off as an enlisted soldier. In 2011 I graduated from the US Military Academy as a Second Lieutenant with a Bachelor’s in Management with a Systems Engineering track.  I’m working on a Master’s in Social Work and am on track to graduate December 2020. I can’t wait, I’m so excited. I want to work with other military members, both current and veterans, either on my base or at the VA.   My partner is also a disabled veteran who is an entrepreneur in the Information Technology field. He is looking into going back to school or into the civilian sector.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  Not much. When I enlisted, that was my first job and where I got my first paycheck. I learned how to file taxes using the many online resources available. At the US Military Academy, I learned about saving because we as cadets had an automatic savings account created once we became enrolled.  In our junior year, we get what’s called a “Cow Loan,” which is a Career Starter Loan– a loan to help cadets get started in life upon graduation. A lot of cadets buy a car. I purchased a car and opened an IRA account and a personal savings account and helped my family with the family trucking business.  Now that I’m a mom of three, all my kids have their own savings account and a college fund. If anything happens, they’ll have funds. My oldest child is even able to access her account so that if there’s an emergency, she can take care of the issue.  I bank with Navy Federal, and when I lived in Tennessee, I lived near a bank branch that had the capability of depositing change directly into one’s account. I liked this and I would take my oldest every couple weeks to deposit any spare change she had collected directly into her savings.  What’s your lowest financial point?  I am currently at my lowest financial point in life. This past year, I left my job to go back to school. My family and I are living off my disability income and my income from my position as a Recreation Aide and we are making it work. Things are tight and I had to take out a loan against my vehicle, but I was able to pay it back.  What’s your highest financial point?  My time in the military. I was paid two times a month and I didn’t have to worry about paying bills or putting food on my family’s table. Also, my most recent employment after the military these past few years. I purchased my first home that will be my forever home.  So really, this past year has been both my highest and lowest point financially.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  When I was leaving the military, my counselor found out I was going to be a government employee. He suggested I invest in the thrift savings plan (TSP) at the highest amount. My employer matched my monthly contributions. It helped that it was an automatic withdrawal, so I did not see the money or worry about it coming out of my account.  What are your goals for the future?  I want to enjoy each day and make sure my family has enough financial security to ensure we have a roof over our head and food on the table.   What does money mean to you in your life?  To me, money is the way to get the expensive things in life if you want it. I live a very frugal life, but if I want to do something big, I need to save and plan.  What financial advice you would give others?  Start saving! If you have children, open a savings account for them and put in a few dollars, even just $5 dollars. Slowly increase it so you have financial security no matter what happens. "}
{"prompt":"Relying on Credit Cards to Get Through the COVID-19 Pandemic","completion":" In 2020, SaverLife members have been withdrawing money from their savings more often than they did in 2019. And compared to last year, people are relying more on credit cards to feed their families. For people living in households earning less than $50,000 a year, credit card balances have increased by 38% from last year.  During these difficult times, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion are offering  FREE weekly credit reports  until  April 2021 . And if you’re wondering how to create a family-friendly budget during the COVID-19 pandemic, SaverLife CFP Tania Brown has some  tips just for you .    Credit card debt   A third of SaverLife members are also reporting an increase in credit card balances. If you’re struggling to save money while you’re in debt, here’s  how to start an emergency fund .  “I’m also on the Food Share Program, which has helped a bit. At this point, everything is month to month, and I pay down whatever I can come up with. On top of all that,  I can’t afford to pay my credit cards off . I have three liens against me.  It costs $2,500 to file for bankruptcy, and I can’t even afford to do that. ” – Michelle , SaverLife member "}
{"prompt":"Catching Up With Derkisha, Our 2019 Story Contest Winner","completion":" “ When I think about the future, I feel strong and empowered. “  We recently had the opportunity to catch up with  Derkisha , our 2019 $5,000 Tax Time Grand Prize Winner. She had some big news to share! Here’s what she had to say:  When I think about the future, I feel strong and empowered. It wasn’t always this way though. I found myself feeling alone and overwhelmed throughout my life as a young single mom, like the weight of the world was on my shoulders. Before I went back to school, there were times when I felt like I didn’t have any worth. I didn’t really have an identity, but being a student, I saw myself in a different light. It’s been so helpful for me feeling like I can do whatever I set my mind to. I’m so proud of myself for believing in my abilities.  I’d like to think my children will be inspired to go to college because they saw me going to college.  Going back to college as a single parent in my 30s wasn’t always easy, especially as a non-traditional student ( Chemistry almost took me out! ). I thought I was going to lose my mind because here was this opportunity, and because of the COVID-19 lockdowns, now I had to decide whether I could keep going or stop because I had no way to make sure my children were taken care of.  I knew I had to put on a brave face for my children, who were also struggling with this huge shift in all of our lives, but there’s nothing like knowing you can’t survive without school to keep you in school . My big kids really stepped up in helping me around the house and caring for their younger siblings. The support of all my family and friends made a big difference, too. I’m extremely grateful for my friends at SaverLife and will never forget the blessing I received through their support.   I can’t even describe what earning my degree means to me. I know it’s just an Associate’s degree, but  this degree means that I can go out and continue to change the circumstances of my family . It means I can continue in my schooling, get a higher education degree, and become a better, productive person of society. I want to be able to take care of my needs and without having to rely on others to help me.   My next steps are to attend Texas A&M University of Commerce, complete my prerequisites, take the TEAS, and apply to their nursing program.  For me, being a nurse is more than a paycheck — it’s a calling and a passion . Passion is the energy that keeps us going, that keeps us filled with meaning, and happiness, and excitement, and anticipation. Passion is a powerful force in accomplishing anything you set your mind to, and in experiencing work and life to the fullest extent possible. Ultimately, passion is the driving force behind success and happiness that allows us all to live better lives, and all those things are truly all the things I desire for myself and my children: a happy, meaningful, exciting and successful life. As Harriet Tubman once so simply, but profoundly, put it, “Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.”  "}

{"prompt":"Celebrating 500,000 SaverLife Members: Our Chief Impact Officer’s Letter to You","completion":" When I joined SaverLife in 2017, we had 30,000 members. When our CEO, Leigh, told me that her goal was to reach 1 million members by 2022, I felt hesitant.  Can SaverLife really reach one million people ?   Four years later, we’re well on our way.   This month, we are celebrating the huge milestone of reaching  500,000 members  across the country. Our growth has come from a relentless pursuit of a single goal: helping people save. We do this not by pushing our preconceived notions on people, but by designing products that meet people where they are.   In the past four years, we have transformed our platform from a matched-savings program reaching 6,000 San Francisco residents to a prize-linked savings program that reaches half a million people across the country. As our President and CEO, Leigh, said before going on parental leave last month, “In the last 12 months, we’ve grown our membership by nearly 300%. If there was ever a proof point that showed the value of what we do, that [is it].”  As we look to the future, we’re focused on personalizing the savings experience on our platform to reach even more people. We will continue using technology to have an impact at scale. Here’s to the next 500,000 SaverLife members.   David Chief Impact Officer, SaverLife "}
{"prompt":"Margaret and Tom’s Story: Giving All They Can During the Coronavirus Lockdown","completion":" Meet Margaret and Tom, East Coast natives who live in Connecticut.    What do you both do for work?  Margaret : I’ve been a United Way food pantry manager for the past 14 years. Normally, I order food for pickup, help people shop, and take inventory. It’s only open certain times a day to limit the foot traffic. My boss helps keep track of the stats for who’s coming in: age, race, and gender. We used to get a lot of kids coming through, but now those kids are grown up. These days, we’re getting a lot of people in the 45-80 age group.  Before this job, I worked at phone company for 20 years. When I finished my time at the phone company, I spent a year trying to find something to do. For nine months, I was searching for a job. Then, I ended up getting a job at the food pantry. I’ve been here ever since.  My husband, Tom, is on disability, and he worked part-time until last year. He worked at a temporary transitional housing program, where he worked with tenants’ case managers on finding appropriate housing, helping them go shopping for groceries, and making sure they followed the program’s rules. Tom also did a great job in helping raise our son.  What does a day in your lives currently look like?   Margaret : Tom and I spend a lot of time together once I’m off from work. We didn’t have the empty nester syndrome when our son moved last May because he only moved a mile away from us. In addition to working as a police dispatcher, he’s an EMT. We haven’t been going out as much. I tell people, “We’ll have the best-looking yard when all of this is done.”  Tom : I worked in the yard, clean the house, and go on social media. We enjoy being home and taking care of the home. When our son moved out, our utilities bill decreased by 40%. Our water and gas company even called to ask if anything was wrong with our meter, which is funny because they never called when the bill was higher than average! Our son’s moving out made a difference in our bills over the last nine months.  What does budgeting look like for you two these days?  Tom : We’ve learned to go through all the groceries we have before going out again as well as pinch pennies more often.  Margaret : We have a jar of babysitting money that we save for a rainy day. It’s there if something small comes up. Tom is also saving a penny a day this year. We want to take a three-day trip somewhere. We haven’t gone away for a vacation in 34 years. It would be really nice to either go to Niagara Falls or Acadia National Park, Maine.   What do you envision for your family’s future?  Margaret : We’re trying to stay focusing on saving up for our trip. Tom’s never been to Niagara Falls, and I thought that it would be something nice to do. I haven’t been there since I was a teenager in my high school’s 4-H program.   We had to file for bankruptcy four years ago because of medical bills. Ever since then, we focused on paying down what we owe.    Tom : The Quicken Loan people we work with are very nice. We pay over the phone. They work with us to figure out what we’re able to pay each month.   How do you feel about the shelter-in-place mandate?  Margaret : It’s weird. There’s a hill we typically drive on that’s usually so busy you can see the traffic for two miles down the road. These days, you almost forget you’re driving on that same road because no one is around you. At the food pantry that I help manage, we have a shelter connected to our building. We have businesses all around us making food for the community. Then it’s posted on Facebook and other social media. We also try to do take out once a week to support local businesses. I’m still able to work, so I’m grateful for that.  It’s scary to think of New York, where the number of people dying from the coronavirus is staggering.  Tom : It’s like fighting an invisible enemy. At this point, I’m worried a lot about the economy. It’s not like the New Deal where jobs were made. Nowadays, people have jobs, but they just can’t go back to them. I also worry about my wife going to work and getting exposed to the coronavirus. Her job is right next to a homeless shelter, and I don’t know where those individuals go all day.  How do your finances look these days?  Margaret : We’re saving what we can. Surprisingly, the gas in our car lasted us two weeks. Though it makes sense because we’re not going out as much. Normally, I’d go to my mom’s once a week. But she’s 89-years old, and all of our jobs (my son’s and mine) include dealing with the public. She doesn’t really understand, and we have to keep explaining to her, “We don’t want to get you sick.”   How do you feel about SaverLife?  Margaret : I read on your site how important it is to pay yourself first. Now we do that, and we’re able to stay on top of things.  "}
{"prompt":"Kimberly’s Story: Securing a Future for her Kids","completion":" Meet Kimberly, a car assembly plant employee who lives with her four children (and fur child) in Ohio.   What’s it like where you live?  I’ve lived in Cincinnati for about 22 years now, but I’m originally from Kansas City, Missouri. The weather is weird, but other than that we live a pretty typical suburban life. In my house, it’s my four kids, me, and our cat.  Can you tell me a little bit about your profession?  For the past two and a half years, I’ve worked on an assembly line making car parts such as alternators. I like it’s because it’s something different. Before this job, I had customer service roles. I made the change to my current job right after I had my son, and I’ve been here ever since.  How’s your work schedule?  We have rotating schedules, which is different compared to many other jobs. It changes every three to four weeks. Right now, I work the 4pm – 2:30am shift. Sometimes, I’ll have to make lunch and dinner for my kids before I leave to go to work for the evening.  What does a day in your life currently look like?   By the time I wake up in the morning, my youngest is already wide awake and ready to say, “Hey world!” An hour or two later, my other kids get up. I make lunch and dinner for them and put those meals in the fridge. We play outside for a while so they can get all their energy out.   After work, I get home around 3 am. By that time, my son is still awake. Actually, three out of my four kids are awake. Around 4 – 4:40am is when they finally go to sleep. It’s rough, but it’s my life.   In your June Journaling post, you mentioned that your savings were drained due to reduced hours and you had to really budget. Could you tell me more about that?  So with my savings drained, we had to live almost paycheck to paycheck again. When we go grocery shopping, if we don’t need it, we don’t get it. I write everything down and then cross it off the list to make sure we get what we need and don’t spend more than we need to. The Kroger’s app is really helpful because it helps me keep track of how much I’m spending at the store. In addition to using that grocery shopping app, we use a lot of coupons or wait until items are on sale. I also don’t buy anything full price.  How are you feeling about your situation right now?  To be honest, I’m very overwhelmed. It’s a lot for me and my children.   My oldest daughter, who’s ten years old, is a social butterfly, and she misses her friends and cheerleading. And my youngest daughter has special needs, so she doesn’t understand what’s going on. We have a huge yard, which I’m grateful for, and I try to do my best to keep them happy.   My son loves playing in water, and my other daughter loves chalk and bubbles. Altogether, they all just love being outside.   What would you like to do after this is all over?  I want to go on a family vacation with all five of us. Maybe I’ll take them to the beach or something. I never really went on a vacation with them, so that would be nice.  What are you saving for?  Our future, honestly. I’m saving for a future for my kids. With my daughter being special needs, I don’t know what the future is going to hold for her, but I just want to make sure she’s secure.  In the short-term, I want to save up for a house. Right now, I’m just working on building my credit.  What does money mean to you right now?  It means being able to live. Even though we’re in a pandemic, the bills didn’t stop—nothing stopped. I wanted to make sure we had everything we needed: a roof over our heads, diapers, clothes, and food. As bad as it is, money rules the world.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I never heard about it until a few months ago, but I was so grateful to find you guys. I read the  Money 101  articles, and they’re so informative. Also, SaverLife introduced me to TrustPlus financial coaching and that was really helpful. You guys helped me out with my savings. I actually told my friends about the program, too. "}
{"prompt":"Paige’s Story: A School Counselor in the Making","completion":" Meet Paige, a full-time graduate student who lives with her family in Enfield, Connecticut.   What are you studying in graduate school?  My concentration is in school counseling and I’m super excited to finally graduate this May. After I earn my Master’s, I either want to work in either a Connecticut- or Massachusetts-based school district.  Walk me through a day in your life.   Right now, everything from my classes to my internship is virtual. It was tough to adjust to at first, but now I think I have it all figured out.   On a typical day, I wake up, work out, hop on Microsoft Teams to meet with my students and supervisors from 8am-3pm, then I have a break until my evening class, which is from 4-6:30pm. Some days I have to physically go into work, too.  What kind of work do you do in-person?  I’m a nanny and I help out a local family. Additionally, I’m also a behavior technician and help kids who have autism. When I’m not busy with either of those two jobs, I work at the local YMCA. We’re not doing much at the center these days with COVID-19 precautions and all that.  What does paying your student loans look like right now?  I have both private and federal loans. For the latter, the interest is still at 0%, which I’m really grateful for. However, I still have to make payments on my private student loans. Since I’m a full-time student, I only have to pay the interest on my private student loans.  When COVID-19 restrictions caused businesses to shut down, I couldn’t work and needed help paying my student loans. My mom would help me out every once in a while. I’ll be honest, I’m nervous about what my payment plan is going to look like when I’ll be required to pay both my private and federal student loans at the same time.   Did you receive either stimulus check last year?  I didn’t receive the $1,200 or $600 stimulus checks because my mom still claims me as a dependent. I really wish I did receive them though because it’s not like I don’t also have bills to pay.   You won $250 from our Savings Boost challenge  last year. What was your reaction to winning and how did you use the cash prize?  I used the money to pay off some of my student loans! Obviously, I was very grateful and shocked when I got an email saying that I won a cash prize. It just so happened that I was checking my inbox before work one day and opened that email in particular. I was so excited that I immediately called my mom and shared the good news with her. It was the first time I had won something from SaverLife.  What does budgeting and saving look like for you this year?  I actually started a savings challenge this past January 2021. I took a deck of 52 cards and wrote $1 – $52 on each of them. Once a week, I pull a random card and that’s what I save that week. I even got my mom to join! So that’s what I’ve been doing to help me stay motivated to save.  Overall, I’m also trying to increase my savings so I can be a bit more prepared to pay off my student loans when my repayment plan starts up again.  And as far as budgeting, I use Google Sheets to help me track my income, fixed expenses like bills, and varying expenses like dining out and shopping. It’s great because the Google Sheet automatically calculates how much money I have leftover after I’m done inputting my expenses for the month.   What would you like to do when things get better?  I’m honestly just looking forward to being able to hang out with all of my friends again. I miss them so much. It’s tough because we’re all living in different places now that we’re out of college.   Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  I did a little bit, but I was also able to qualify for unemployment. Once I found out through my job that I was able to apply for unemployment, the process was pretty easy.  Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  I’d definitely say paying off my car last July has been my biggest achievement to date. My car was my first “big girl purchase.” When I signed the loan paperwork, I was on a six-year repayment plan. But I was able to pay off my car in four years instead.   How’d you find out about SaverLife?  I discovered SaverLife through a financial planning program through The Village of Children and Family. During a regular meeting, I received a flyer about the ALICE Saves program and signed up from there.  I love the SaverLife website and the different  savings challenges . I just noticed that SaverLife added  savings levels and badges  as well. Those are really motivating and remind me of my Apple Watch, where you can earn a badge if you meet all of your goals. "}
{"prompt":"Gabriel’s Story: Freelancing His Way to Financial Security","completion":" Meet Gabriel, a freelancer and college student who’s living with his family in Alabama until his college campus reopens for in-person classes.  What are you studying at college?  I’m entering my sophomore year at college, studying engineering at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. I personally call it the “Canada” of Alabama due to the colder winter weather and our signature sport: hockey. The school is very technology focused. It has the most engineers as well as ties to the space race.   What does a day in your life look like right now?   My day is mostly centered around freelancing. The first thing I do is look at my emails; I need to be caught up with them on the daily. Then, I’ll check my social media accounts, especially LinkedIn and Instagram. After, I’ll check out postings on UpWork—that’s where I get the most clients for my freelancing job. Recently, I’ve worked with different companies from real estate to small mom and pop shops to political campaigns.   Could you tell me more about your family?  I’m a first-generation American. My dad came from Venezuela and worked hard to get me where I am today. I want to be able to continue working hard like he did. Like most people, I want to make my dad proud.   What’s it like to live legally blind in your town?  Right now, I’m living with my parents in a small town called Tarrant, Alabama. It’s next to Birmingham, which is the closest big city. The downtown area is accessible by car, and there’s only one bus route to downtown and back. The thing is, it’s scheduled for 5am four days a week, so it’s not easy for someone like me who’s legally blind to schedule my day around using public transportation. I have to plan out whole days if I’m going out. It’s definitely a process.   Huntsville isn’t a mecca when it comes to public transportation. On Fridays, I can go get my groceries and make a trip to the mall as well as my university, but that’s about it. When I get my degree and my first post-college job, I want to live in a place where I have access to good public transportation.  It’s no secret that Uber is expensive, and on top of that, we don’t have the Uber pool option here. In fact, it’s twice as expensive where I live. For example, from Tarrant to inner city Birmingham, it’s $15. And that’s just one way. I used to use Uber twice a week to get to work and back. So that was $30 for transportation right off the bat.  One time when I was 17, I was planning a trip to see my girlfriend who lives in Tennessee. I knew I needed to save up for that trip, so that’s when I started freelancing. It was then that I realized I could make money and work remotely as well.  Tell me more about your experience with freelancing.   I’m a software developer. That’s my main position. I help people build websites. Also, I translate documents from English to Spanish and vice versa, and do some voice acting as well. I realized that all I needed was a laptop, good internet connection, and grit. Freelancing has made me understand that being your own boss is a hassle, but the freedom you get from freelancing is worth the cost.   It wasn’t easy at first. I wondered, “How will people want me as a client? How will I stand out?” I somehow managed to do it and eventually build a whole client base. With the money I earn from freelancing, I’m trying to pay for college. The great thing about being a freelancer is the work experience that I’m gaining. It’s great to have on a resume in addition to part-time jobs and internships.   I will say that the one downside of freelance work is the taxes! They’re way different compared to the taxes that people with regular, full-time jobs have to fill out. That being said, I’m glad the  IRS offers Free File  for those who make $65K or below. That’s come in handy. In my community, we also have this organization called United Way that helps people file their taxes.     In addition to participating in SaverLife’s savings program, Gabriel received a grant through the SaverLife  Emergency Response Fund .  Could you tell me more about your financial situation?  I talk to people about how to build credit. My mom told me not to pick up a credit card, but I believe that if you know how to use them correctly, they can work in your favor. And if you know how to play by the rules, you’ll get ahead. Money shouldn’t be a taboo thing to talk about.   I also believe that if you have grit, merit, and you’re willing to work hard, you deserve to go to college. Sometimes I feel like an outlier. I’m legally blind, but the reason I get to study computer science is because I’ve been blessed with scholarships. Other people should have that opportunity as well.   What are you saving for right now?  Besides saving up to pay for college, I’d really like to buy a house. The homes in my immediate area go for about $10,000, but the neighborhood isn’t that good. That’s why I’m looking to move to Huntsville, where my college is located. The going rate for homes is about $100,000, but if I figured if I can muster $27,000 a year for school, I could afford a home one day. It also doesn’t hurt that there are so many nice people in Huntsville. I would consider buying a home a personal achievement because I’ll know how hard I worked to get there.   Has COVID-19 impacted you?  I would say so. From a social perspective, Venezuelan people are known to be fantastic party goers and social butterflies. Not being able to be as outgoing has really been a bummer. Everyone is on WhatsUp messaging each other things like, “I miss you guys.” Going out to eat or making a trip downtown to grab coffee—all the small luxuries of life are gone.   When it came to my academics, it was definitely a culture shock. Online classes work in my favor, but it’s a hit or miss when it comes to the professors teaching the class. With the transition to online classes, it’s made a lot of students rethink, “Maybe college shouldn’t cost $27K in the fall.”   What would you like to do after COVID-19 has passed?  Truth be told, I can’t wait to get back to my college campus in the fall. I really do miss my friends and our late night trips to Waffle House.   Have you picked up any new hobbies recently?  Actually, I’ve been getting into cooking. I’ve gotta up my cooking game. That’s what’s pushed me to discover healthier dishes. Recently, I cooked grilled chicken with tomatoes and zucchini. The last couple of dishes I’ve made were definitely not like the usual college diet.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I feel like SaverLife is a one-of-a-kind organization. As somebody who relies on assistance for things, I’ve run into organizations that talk more about what they do than actually doing anything. I’m glad that SaverLife actually commits to doing what it set out to do.  I found SaverLife through the Steady app. My first thought was, “This is fantastic!”  I really like that you have a platform for people to share their  stories  and  experiences with money . I like that people can collectively talk about things like taxes and building wealth. It’s great that you all are helping people with managing their money.   Do you have anything else you’d like to add?  I’ll be honest, jumping into freelancing at 17 was a blind leap of faith (pun intended), but I have no regrets in doing it. It’s taught me a lot of valuable skills that I hope to use once I graduate college. I encourage the SaverLife community to look into it as a potential option for taking control of their financial future.    "}
{"prompt":"Do ups and downs in income make it hard for you to save?","completion":"Last month , our research showed that 70% of SaverLife Savers experience ups and downs in income. These fluctuations can make it harder to budget and save. After all, how can you plan for your financial goals when you don’t know how your income will change every month?  We were shocked to learn how frequent and how intense these monthly income changes are for our Savers.  The typical Saver experiences income volatility 3 out of every 4 months.  On average, this works out to a whopping 9 months of the year when your income is at least 25% higher or lower than your average income.  Income swings are significant and frequent  Contrary to what many people think, income volatility can also involve spikes in income. In fact, over half of volatility events are increases in income. The median monthly dip is $1,208 and the median monthly spike is $1,346.   Even in months when Savers have more income to work with, they tell us that it may still be difficult to save. They’re still juggling income and expenses, and they sometimes have to catch up on bills and other expenses that they’ve put off during months of lower income.  Joey, a Saver from California, told us, “The income ups and downs have a huge impact. I have to watch everything I buy and be extremely frugal. Medical expenses are pretty big; because of the ACA I’m able to see basic doctors, but I have to pay for specialists out of pocket.” "}
{"prompt":"Thank You.","completion":" This has been the most challenging year. SaverLife strives to help families prepare for financial emergencies, but we never imagined a crisis of the magnitude or reach of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope the health crisis will decrease in the spring, but the economic consequences will be long lasting.   The impact on SaverLife members has been especially devastating.  Our latest research  found that 73% of you are unemployed or have lost hours at work as a result of the pandemic. Credit card balances are 56% higher than the same time period last year, and grocery store spending remains elevated. Saving money has never been more difficult.   One thing that has stayed constant in these difficult times is the resilience of SaverLife members—all 460,000 of you. SaverLife has always been a savings platform, but this is the year it truly became a community—because of you. From words of encouragement in the forums, to strangers sharing SaverLife resources on Facebook, SaverLife members are supporting each other like never before.   In 2020, we were honored to share the stories of people like  Heather , a hospice nurse recovering from an unexpected layoff, and  Monica , a mother who struggled to save money after her rent was increased, but still found a way to give back to her neighborhood. Your stories of hope and resilience are the reason we come to work every day, and we will keep fighting for you.   As we look to 2021, I remain committed to advocating for you and providing help whenever we can. Until then, thank you for all you bring to our community and know that, no matter what your circumstances, you are not alone.  "}
{"prompt":"Sherell’s Story: Overachieving on Saving","completion":" Meet Sherell, a born and raised Delaware native and mother of two teenage sons.    What do you do?  I just finished working at UPS because of health issues. I’m not working at the moment, but I’m currently looking for more work. I think the next move might be to something in the customer service field. I’m good in that department. Warehouse work really took a toll on me—especially on my back. Especially not working at the moment, I’ve had to tap into some reserves.   What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My upbringing taught me how to save. I found that it’s hard to save for things that you need, not want. I was also taught to keep up with the bills.   Do you have any financial lessons you’d like to pass onto your sons?  My oldest boy just started working. We’re working on budgeting. I taught him to take $5-$10 out of every paycheck and save it for his future. Who knows? He may want to get his own apartment or car soon. My oldest just got money for Christmas. He doesn’t want to spend it.  My youngest boy also has his own account. He has a bank in his room that he keeps his money in.   Did you reach a financial goal you set for yourself this year?  This year I reached $2,500 in my savings, which I’ve never done before. That was a goal for me because I wanted to save money. My original goal was $1,500 and I overdid it. With tax time coming up, I plan on saving even more because I want to get a new house.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  My father always told me “don’t think twice about saving. Just take your money and put it in your savings account.” I still follow this today. If I think about it too long, then it’s an issue. Normally, what I do is take it out of my savings account, so I don’t have to worry or be tempted to withdraw it later. That way it’s easier for me to save.  What are your goals for the future?  I would say to get a car because I don’t have one right now. I’m looking to buy one used to drive my son around. Of course, there are buses around, but when it gets cold, it’s a drag not having a car.   What does money mean to you in your life?  Money, to me, means supplying my needs. "}

{"prompt":"How Voting Affects Your Financial Future","completion":" SaverLife’s mission is to create prosperity by helping you save and invest in your future. As you start to build your savings, it’s important to acknowledge that there are policies, laws, and other systemic barriers that impact your financial security.  That’s why we were excited to learn that  85%  of SaverLife members plan to vote this November.     Voting is one of the most important ways you can influence those policies and laws that affect your financial future. How you vote helps determine who represents your interests in government and how they will support policies that make it harder or easier for you and your family to get by — and reach your dreams.  In fact, you could say that voting is a critical part of saving for your future.  We believe it’s important to vote, both in national elections (like the presidential election in November) as well as those in your town and state. The decisions you make and the leaders you elect have an impact on your life, so creating the future you want begins with a vote.  But if you’re new to the process, you haven’t voted in a while, you’ve moved, or your circumstances have changed, you may not know exactly how to cast your vote in the next election. And that’s okay. We’re all in this together to navigate the challenge of voting safely during a pandemic.  To get you started, we’ve created resources for you to draw upon to make your vote count.

{"prompt":"Ramona’s Story: Fostering Change in Her Community","completion":" Meet Ramona, a full-time small business owner who lives in South Bronx, New York.   Tell me about yourself.   I’m a first-generation graduate with a Master’s degree. Right now, it’s just myself and my pets and we live in public housing. I’ve been living in public housing for four and a half years now.   When the $1,200 federal stimulus came in last year, it really helped. The additional money I received from self-employed unemployment also helped me establish my savings, which I haven’t been able to in years.   How did  Ojala  start and what are your goals for your company?   Prior to my nephew being born, I had spent ten years living in Hawaii, connecting with my indigenous background. I fully immersed myself in the Hawaiian culture and the symbolism. When I was living in Hawaii, I bought him these unique tops with culturally inspired drawings and sayings.   One day, I was changing him when I realized that all his clothes looked the same. I remember Googling “onesies for Hispanic babies,” but was so appalled when I saw a onesie that read “Bad Hombre”—that was  not  okay. It was so inappropriate.   That’s when I got to talking when a Hawaiian friend of mine, Jim, about starting a clothing business for Hispanic culture inspired clothing. He’s still my mentor to this day. We started meeting once a month, and after nine months, the business was incorporated. In addition to making our brand culturally conscious, I also wanted to have our products be environmentally friendly.   All of our designs very boldly say, “I’m indigenous and I’m Hispanic.” I try to incorporate a sense of who we are as a community with every piece of clothing. When I see my babies wearing my designs, it’s almost a protest. There’s nothing bolder than putting on those clothes. ABC7 recently featured us for Hispanic Heritage Month, too.   Prior to starting my company, I had always worked in government. I already knew that there were a ton of resources out there to help me get started. I started working with different programs like Start Small, Think Big to help me get my vision off the ground. Start Small, Think Big is a mentorship program from Columbia University that partners with small businesses like mine. In addition to helping me create my brand, they helped me get a better picture of my current financial situation and set up Google ads for a few months.     I am a member of SaverLife, social entrepreneur and founder of  Ojala Threads Inc.  We design premium baby onesies inspired by indigenous Hispanic heritage. Our Sales Support advocacy work focused on criminal justice reform, public housing, and public transportation in the South Bronx. To learn more about our story and impact on our community visit  www.ojalathreads.com   Could you tell me more about the impact your business has on your community?  We have a huge social responsibility agenda. It’s so important to me that my company is an asset to my community. Where I live, more than 50% of the people live below the poverty level. 75% of the people that go to Rikers are from three neighborhoods in my city. The same way it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to lose them.   I’ve lived in public housing for the last five years, and my *grandmother’s been here as well for the last 29 years. When I moved back from Hawaii to New York, I wanted to be with my *grandmother and spend her golden years with her.   To me, this is one of the last places you can thrive. While your rent is 30% of your income, the living conditions are deplorable. For example, the elevators have been out 80% of time for the last two months. Public housing is being threatened where I live, and Ojala is trying to foster those necessary community conversations. We have meetings every week and facilitate conversations about the privatization of our public housing.   I’d love to have the Ojala staff to do community responsibility work. I love what I’ve created, but I think once the designs are made, eventually I want people to take on some of the responsibilities. All my jobs have been related to outreach and community development.   Ojala has redefined what success means to me. I don’t know if I could do what I do if I didn’t feel the responsibility to do it.   How have your sales been like during the COVID-19 pandemic?   It’s really been a struggle these last couple of months. 80% of our sales used to come in through pop-up shops, but since March we’ve had to pivot and turn our in-person shops into an online platform. It’s an investment to host a website. I have an intern who helps with graphics and expanding the catalog, but it’s still a lot of work. We got $50 in sales last August, and in September and October, we got about $70 in sales. If it weren’t for the grants to keep us afloat, we wouldn’t be able to go on.   How do you feel about SaverLife?   I found out about SaverLife when I received an Emergency Response Fund grant last spring. When I received that money, I was able to use it to pay down my credit card debt.   Also, the financial coach I met through SaverLife told me about Disability Discharge, which really helped me with my student loans.   *After we interviewed Ramona last year, her grandmother passed away shortly after on December 29, 2020 due to complications associated with COVID-19. Ramona and her family are in our thoughts and this Saver Story is dedicated to her grandmother.  "}

{"prompt":"Nastassia’s Story: I See Brightness in My Future","completion":" Meet Nastassia, a mother of five and an immigrant from Jamaica who has been living in New York since 2009.  What do you do?  Right now I’m not working. I had an injury when I was pregnant with my last child, so I’m at home. My fiancé just started at a new job at a warehouse.  I was injured at a store near my home. The injury makes my life so much more difficult. I go to physical therapy, but it’s still an issue. It’s not getting worse, but it’s not getting better either. I’m not able to do a lot of things because of the pain.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I’ve always been the person who saves. Especially coming from Jamaica, things are so different. There is so little opportunity there and so little resources.  When I got money from my parents for lunch at school, I would often save it. There would be weeks at a time when I didn’t have lunch. But I had great friends who shared their lunch with me because they knew what I was saving for. I didn’t tell my family I was saving my lunch money because I didn’t want them to worry about me. I wanted to be able to buy the things that I needed without asking them.  What’s your highest financial point?  The highest was when it was just me and my kids in Florida. We had better credit and it was more comfortable. When we were living in Florida, I had two jobs to make sure I could give my kids a good life. I never want them to see me struggle or suffer.  What’s your lowest financial point?  Before my fiancé got a job was the lowest point. It’s still a challenging time because we’re struggling with rent and bills.  It’s always been up and down. I want a future where we don’t have to struggle so much.  I am just trying to stay positive. I have to be positive for my kids. If anything were to happen, it would be fine as long as I was still around. If I had to have three jobs to support my kids, I would.  What are your goals for the future?  I see brightness in my future, if I keep saving. Some people want flashy things. And that’s not me. I’m not the kind of person who wants to buy this or that and show off to the world.  I want my kids to continue in school obviously. They’re good right now. Even though they’re young, they’re smart. I want to keep them on that path. I also don’t want to force school on them. I don’t want to be that parent. My oldest says he wants to be a marine biologist because he’s really into animals. I hope he stays on this path. My other two oldest kids keep switching what they want from the future.  Whatever they decide they want to do, I’ll stick by their side.   What does money mean to you in your life?  It’ll be good to have a substantial amount, but I’m not money-hungry. I’m not that person. At the end of the day, if you die, you can’t take it with you. But it does make your life a little bit better.  If you’re money-hungry, you’ll push everything important aside. People will be in your life because you have money, but not for you. "}
{"prompt":"Omar’s Story: Establishing Credit is the Foundation of Wealth","completion":" Meet Omar, a full-time college student living in San Francisco, CA with his parents and 21-year old son.  What do you do?  I’m studying behavioral science and addiction counseling at the City College of San Francisco. I want to be a part of the solution of dealing with all the pain that’s in the world—or some of it anyway.  I also do temp work when I’m not in class.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My mom didn’t know about managing money, so she couldn’t really teach me about it. As I got older, just over the last year or two, I got a better understanding of credit and finances.  What’s your lowest/highest financial point?  My lowest point was when I was homeless and had nowhere to go and no job.  I’ve since raised my credit score and got approved for a credit card recently. I’ve been able to save and establish a dedicated savings account. I’m doing better at managing money overall.  Once I got educated about finances, it all made sense. I knew that this was what I was supposed to be doing. Before, I didn’t have any direction, but now I know a lot more. I’m still looking for a lot more knowledge on the subject. But at least I have a foundation that I’m building on.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Use your credit card only once a month, and for $20. That’s a piece of advice that I follow. Someone told me that, and I was surprised. But it’s true! Just because you have credit doesn’t mean you have to use it.  What would you tell your younger self about money?  Establish your credit! That’s the foundation of wealth in this country. Credit has a lot to do with how you stabilize yourself financially. Nowadays, you need credit for jobs and housing and everything.  You’re either going to get the prime rate or the subprime rate, and if you have bad credit, you’re essentially giving away thousands of dollars in interest.  What are your goals for the future?  Get my BA from City College of San Francisco and get employed in the field I’m studying.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It doesn’t have as much value as I thought. Now, I have a more realistic value of money. Because of that, I have more money. I’m able to save more; I don’t spend as much. I’m more conscious of things I buy because I have a bigger goal, and I know I can’t be spending crazy amounts if I want to reach my bigger goals.  What is the best thing you’ve ever bought with your money?  Probably paying off my debt! I actually just paid off some lingering debt, which was getting in my way of moving forward. How can you move forward if you’re still paying into your past?   How will you feel when you pay off all your debt?  It’ll be a relief! Instead of focusing on the big picture and getting overwhelmed; I’m breaking it down month by month. I’m paying down $25/month right now. And as I make more, I’ll be able to pay off more, but at least I’m making progress. "}

{"prompt":"Barbara’s Story: A Penny Found is a Penny Saved","completion":" Meet Barbara, a happy retired grandmother who lives in Eugene, Oregon.  What do you do?  Before I retired, I worked as a cashier and gas station attendant. I also volunteered a lot. I have five grandkids and they all live in Eugene. They’re 3, 5, 8, 9, and 11. There are two boys and three girls. I do a lot of babysitting – they keep my hands busy!  I’m also on disability, so I have to manage with what I can. During the summer, there are a lot of mouths to feed. I’ve been on disability since 2000, when I had my stroke.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My mother taught me that when we had a penny, give it to the church. I always learned that giving is important, but saving wasn’t something I learned as much. I didn’t learn that until I was in my 30s. But at that point, I had children and was living on minimum wage, which made it really hard to save.  I think it was the same for my mom, who worked two jobs. I remember her being really thrifty and resourceful.   What have been your lowest and highest financial points?  The lowest point was when I lost my job at Walmart. It only takes one paycheck, and I missed that paycheck. I still had my job at McDonald’s, but then I got a 30-day notice from my apartment. Between my husband and I, we had three jobs, but we still ended up on the street.  I divorced my husband so that I could stay in a shelter with my daughters. I’m still best friends with my husband, but you do what you have to do to make things work financially to get a roof over your heads.  We had 90 days in a shelter to find new housing. And then I was able to be back with my husband, but not legally married. That was 19 years ago. It was a hard time, an ugly time. Everything crashed all at once. My daughter was also very sick and in the ICU.  It makes you so strong, and I did everything I could to get out of that. It’s a humbling experience to know that you don’t have enough and that you can’t provide for your children. I think that’s the hard thing.  Now it is really rewarding to be with my grandchildren. We go to the library and to the park. We do a book program at the library together. I’m blessed that both of my daughters have homes and have done well for themselves.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  My dad always emphasized how every penny counts. Some people say, “find a penny, pick it up, and you’ll have good luck.” But he said, “Find a penny, pick it up, and save it.”  Some people say, “time is money,” but some of us have time and not money.  What would you tell your 18-year-old self about money?  Besides the fact that it doesn’t grow on trees? [Laughs] That it isn’t bad to pay yourself first. It’s self-care. It’s putting the air mask on yourself first. I didn’t learn that until my 40s.  How has your life changed in the past few years?  Since January, I’ve changed my lifestyle a lot. I’ve become a vegetarian again. I’ve changed from a size 20 to a size 4. So, I’ve been able to sell my old clothes at Buffalo Exchange. It’s also more economical! That’s what I’m finding out.  A program I volunteer with is Grassroots Garden. It allows me to be in the sunshine, and then I come home with a bag of vegetables! "}
{"prompt":"Ask an Expert episode 2 follow-up: Your Questions About the Second Stimulus Bill, Answered","completion":"    Earlier this month, we hosted a  Facebook Live  featuring our resident public policy expert,  Radha Seshagiri , and moderator/marketing intern,  Morgan Alford . Here are the questions Radha answered, as well as some helpful resources.   1. Am I eligible to get a stimulus check?  Here’s how to  check your eligibility You must: Be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident  Have a valid SSN (only one person in the family has to have an SSN) Not be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return Note that your 2018 or 2019 income is under $75,000 (single, or married filing separately) or $150,000 (married filing jointly) for the full amount Know that you can also qualify if you have no income  2. What do I do if I still haven’t received the second stimulus check?  Here’s what to know about the  timing of the second stimulus payment You should have received a stimulus payment by now. The payment will have already arrived via direct deposit or in the mail as check or debit card Don’t worry if you haven’t received it yet. Millions of eligible people still haven’t received one, due to errors made by the IRS   3. The IRS says my check was sent on January 6 but I’ve not received it. Is there a way to track it?  Check your payment status  on the official IRS website or call the IRS toll-free at (800) 919-9835 Double check with your bank to see if you’ve received a deposit  4. How can I get my second stimulus check without filing my taxes?  You need to file your taxes if you haven’t received your check and  claim the Recovery Rebate Credit Even if you don’t normally file taxes—either because you’re on SSI or SSDI or you’re retired or you don’t meet the IRS’ income threshold—it is a good idea to file your taxes this year  to claim any missing stimulus money Haven’t filed your taxes yet? Consider using  Free File from the IRS  5. “We were supposed to receive $600 for our 7 year old son, and we haven’t received it, but we did get $1200 total for Mom and Dad. We don’t make enough to file taxes, so we did the first stimulus through the Non Filers link. What do we do to get the missing stimulus?”  Double check your bank account; the IRS may have made a direct deposit into your account  You can still receive payment! The IRS made a lot of mistakes. Just make sure you file your taxes correctly to get the right amount and  claim the Recovery Rebate Credit The IRS has a trusted program,  Free File , that allows people to file their taxes for free Note that in order for your children to be eligible, they need to be under 17 years old and not have earned more than $4200  6. I owe child support. Does that mean I won’t get the stimulus?   You will still get your  second  stimulus check  even if you owe child support.  7. How will this affect my taxes? If we received both stimulus checks, do we claim them on 2021 taxes?   The second (and first) stimulus check is a credit —  not  taxable income.

{"prompt":"Sylvia’s Story: Home Ownership in the Future","completion":" Meet Sylvia, an HR Manager for the Clark County School District in Nevada. She’s a Las Vegas native who lives with her husband and two adult sons.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  Nothing! That’s why I’m in debt now. I don’t think I was ever taught how to save or how important your credit score was. Really, what I learned from my parents was how easy it is to come into debt. Saving money wasn’t a conversation in our household growing up.  What have been the highest and lowest financial points in your life?  As far as accumulating credit card debt, I’m working on paying off the smallest amount then moving on to the next one. I want to get credit card debt out of the way to boost my credit score, and then I can focus on other things like owning my own home.  I’m also deep in debt with student loans that I’ve been paying off for who knows how long. Actually, I’m still finishing school. In December, I’ll be done with my master’s program in human resource management.   I’ve grown in my work. Career wise, I’m moving in the right direction. Hopefully, I’ll get a better job or promotion. At my current job, we haven’t had raises in nine years or increases in salary based on cost of living. To keep losing money isn’t feasible, you know?   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Save money regardless of how much you earn. Make sure you’re putting something aside.  What are your goals for the future?  I want to pay off my debt and become a homeowner. In five years, hopefully I’m where I need to be.  What does money mean to you in your life?  You need it to live, but I take it day by day. You need it for the things you want. "}

{"prompt":"What you need to do now to receive the Child Tax Credit payments starting July 15","completion":" Stop! Don’t know where to start when it comes to claiming the Child Tax Credit?  Take our short quiz to find out .  Thanks to the improved  Child Tax Credit this year , you could receive  up to an extra $300  for each child in your family, each month from July through December. Here’s what you need to know.  The breakdown  If you filed tax returns for 2019 or 2020 or signed up to receive a stimulus check from the IRS, you will get the Child Tax Credit payments  automatically for the next six months . You do not need to sign up or take any action. If you usually receive your tax returns through direct deposit, that’s how you will receive the advance monthly Child Tax Credit payments. And if you typically receive your tax return via check, then that’s how you’ll receive these payments.  Tip #1 : Signing up for  direct deposit with the IRS  could help you get your credit even faster than waiting for a check to arrive in the mail.  Tip #2 : If you would like to receive one lump sum Child Tax Credit next tax season instead,  use this tool to unenroll  and opt-out of monthly payments.  If you don’t typically file taxes, you may still be eligible to receive the Child Tax Credit  Many families with children are eligible for this crucial tax relief – including those who have not made enough money to be required to file taxes. The IRS has a  tool for non-filers  to receive the Child Tax Credit.  Tip #3 :  Use this tool from the IRS  to claim the Child Tax Credit.  Monthly payments versus one lump sum check  Starting July 15, families will start receiving monthly payments as high as $300 per child as part of the new expanded child tax credit. The most important thing to note about the 2021 Child Tax Credit is that it’s an  ADVANCE  tax credit. So instead of receiving one lump sum on your tax return, you will receive smaller monthly payments. And because the monthly payments are an advance credit, you will receive a smaller tax return in the new year.   Parents alternating who claims a child each year may be the most common situation where a taxpayer may receive the advance child tax credit payments even when they won’t be claiming the child. If you claimed a child for the tax year 2020 but the other parent will claim them for the tax year 2021, you  may want to opt-out of the advance child tax credit payments .  Protect yourself from fraud  Unfortunately, scammers may try to take advantage of people receiving the credit. Here’s how to stay one step ahead:  Be extremely careful about what you share on social media related to your taxes.  Go to official sources like the IRS website to get information. The IRS’s  Taxpayer Advocate Service  is a great resource to find trustworthy tips. Read more  tips on how to recognize a tax scam  and what to keep an eye out for.  Need more info?  Here’s the  official White House website  on the advance Child Tax Credit. You can also share your thoughts on the Child Tax Credit with other SaverLife members in our  community forum . "}

{"prompt":"Meet Your Fellow Savers","completion":"   At the beginning of your journey with SaverLife, we asked you about your goals. Here’s what you and your fellow savers said!  EARN Savers have big goals!  YES, we do! (I’m saving too!) I’m not at all surprised that housing is at the top of our “goals” list. That makes perfect sense! Buying a home is no easy feat, and given the high cost of renting, homeownership may be the best way to create housing stability and build financial security. So if this is your goal, keep on saving and stay tuned for helpful info in the weeks to come. You can also learn more about the  pros and cons of home ownership .  I’m also glad to see that many of us are preparing for emergencies. You may have heard the  recent research  that 47% of Americans would not be able to weather a financial shock of $400. Keep up that saving, and you will certainly have options when (notice I didn’t say “if”) a financial setback hits.  Of course, having a main goal doesn’t mean that we don’t have competing financial priorities. This is really clear, since 35% of you said “other goals,” which is a great reminder that pursuing one goal doesn’t mean we can forget about others.  Take a moment to revisit your goals and the timeline. Look at your spending over the past 12 weeks and check it to see if your spending is aligned with what matters most to you. If you have more than one goal, think about the best way to approach them and remember, we are here to help you stay on track.  It Doesn’t Take Much To Start  I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: there is no such thing as “only a dollar” when it comes to saving. It is inspiring to see so many of you putting $20 a month toward your financial goals. Small steps can make a big difference, and the HABIT of saving is more important than the amount. If you found that saving $20 a month was easy,  set a stretch goal  for the upcoming weeks.  Check out this idea that many of my clients use to jumpstart (or boost) their savings: 52-week savings plan ( regular  and  reversed ).  Little by little, a little becomes a lot. ~ Tanzanian Proverb  How are YOU saving?  It was interesting to see that almost half of you are saving in checking accounts or prepaid cards and I’m wondering: How that is working for you? Are you able to distinguish what you want to save from what you plan to spend? If so, that’s great. If not, let us know and we can help you explore your options. Your savings decisions (where, when, and how) are yours to make and if you’re satisfied, we are thrilled. But if you’re not satisfied, we’ve got your back. Check out  second chance savings accounts  and see if that might work better for you.        All of this data comes from EARN’s research team, which publishes  monthly research insights . As always, we keep your personal information private and secure. "}
{"prompt":"Build Back Better Ensures Investment in Families","completion":" In July, we witnessed a new chapter in our country’s history. Direct payments of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) reached millions of families across the country and help was on the way for families with children who were struggling to pay for groceries, rent, or utilities, build rainy day funds, afford child care, and meet many other needs.  Here at SaverLife, we see firsthand what a difference the expanded CTC makes. The families we work with every day tell us how the expanded CTC means more food on the table, help with  childcare , and the ability to save for the future. We see how enhanced tax credits lead to better financial outcomes for families.   “I was able to afford new clothes for my daughter when she started kindergarten.  Having the payments now… has helped a lot with paying for childcare  which is super expensive.” —  Rhiannon , OH  This is why we celebrate the  Build Back Better  framework: a promise of much-needed investment in American families. Well before the pandemic, low- to moderate-income households were waging an uphill battle against poverty and inequality—especially Black and brown families, who have historically been overlooked and underserved. The Build Back Better framework expands the CTC for another year—and permanent refundability means that the lowest income families will still receive the CTC, lifting up millions.  “The expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) is the  most effective, poverty-fighting effort the federal government has launched  in a long time.” — Leigh Phillips, CEO and President of SaverLife  LOOKING TO THE FUTURE  That’s why we won’t stop fighting. At SaverLife, we believe that all children deserve a strong start and that investing in families means investing in the future. While this one-year expansion to the Child Tax Credit represents a victory for children and families nationwide, there remains much to be done. SaverLife will continue to advocate for the following:  Making the Child Tax Credit expansion  permanent  Ensuring every family that’s eligible for the Child Tax Credit receives it in a timely manner Supporting the eligibility of families with mixed tax filing statuses (SSN/ITIN holders)   Earlier this summer, we developed a four-part approach to guide our work on the Child Tax Credit. As we continue our advocacy, we remain committed to:  Ensuring Access  – Making sure all families are receiving these monthly, advanced tax credit payments or know how to receive these critical funds Encouraging Savings  – Highlighting the importance of preparing financially for the future and using this opportunity to  encourage our members to save  part of their payments Evaluating Impact  – Gaining a deep understanding of how families are using the Child Tax Credit, through interviews, surveys, and analysis of bank account data  Informing Stakeholders  – Sharing testimonies from parents as well as proposals for better processes and rollout of the Child Tax Credit in the years to come  Lastly, we’d like to highlight the long-term impact the Child Tax Credit expansion could have. Almost 75% of parents would choose to invest in their kids’ education if the Child Tax Credit expansion were permanent, building a foundation for economic mobility.    We hope you will  join us  in 2022 as we continue to advocate for making the expanded Child Tax Credit permanent.  "}
{"prompt":"Meet Jennifer: A Mother Building Financial Security for Her Family","completion":" Jennifer is an accountant who lives with her family in Clearlake, Wisconsin. She was selected as one of our 2020 Super Saver of the Year finalists. After filing for bankruptcy, she is committed to creating a financially secure future for her family.   “Growing up, I had no concept of money,” Jennifer said. As she became an adult and started her own family, her financial situation worsened. “My son has medical issues, so we have a lot of added expenses. We were spending way more than what we had. An emergency fund was nonexistent for us.”  The family reached their breaking point in March 2020 when they filed for bankruptcy.   “We were so far in the hole with using credit cards to make ends meet,” Jennifer said. “The credit card payments were way more than we could afford.”  The bankruptcy forced Jennifer and her husband to take a hard look at their financial situation.    It was around this time that Jennifer’s brother introduced her to SaverLife. They took their tax return and put all of it into savings. She also set up automatic deposits from her paycheck to her dedicated savings account.   “Any extra money we have goes into savings,” she said. “We are more knowledgeable and aware of where we’re spending money.”  Jennifer enjoys playing  Scratch & Save  and reading  members’ stories  on the SaverLife website.   “It’s a great place to get information,” she said. “It doesn’t matter where you’re at in your financial journey— there’s people out there like you .”  She plans to use her prize money to save for a down payment on a house and pay down her student loan debt. It’s important to Jennifer to keep saving and learn and grow from her past financial mistakes.   “SaverLife has taught me the importance of saving and that it doesn’t matter how much—$100 or $2—saving is saving,” she said.

{"prompt":"Buchi’s Story: Experiences Instead of Material Items","completion":" Meet Buchi, a self-employed bookkeeper who lives and works in San Francisco.  What do you do?  I’m disabled and I’m self-employed with bookkeeping. I do that on the side. It’s been good for these last 9-12 years.   What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  (laughs) Well, to manage money responsibly. Here in the US, I had to learn that. Growing up in Nigeria, where mommy and daddy took care of your expenses, when you need something, they’ll get it for you. Getting to the U.S., I had to learn how to take care of me, myself, and I.  What have been your lowest and highest financial point?  At my lowest, the recession hit and I fell hard. I had to work my way out of debt and that’s how I learned how to manage my finances. I’m in a much better spot now.  I would say my highest was getting out of debt in 2012 and just surviving off of what I could afford. No credit cards, nothing. Now, if I can’t afford it, I have to let it go. I learned to concentrate on my needs rather than my wants.  What’s your advice to people looking to get out of debt?  Take out a piece of paper, write down how much all your outings cost, and be honest with yourself. What is a need and what is a want? Stop feeling sorry for yourself and start being proactive about your situation.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  The best advice I received is save, save, save, save – no matter how little. It counts. Every nickel, every penny. Always have savings in the back of your mind.   What’s one thing you know about money now that you wish you knew when you were younger?  One thing I know now is that it’s always better to do a one sum payment than to pay monthly. When you pay all at once, you know you’ve paid for it all. If you save, you’ll be able to afford those big items.  What are your goals for the future?  I still want to still be able to travel and see the world. I’ve come to live my life and spend my money on experiences rather than material items. I want to visit Italy, walk around, and try the seafood. I’d rather have money to have those experiences than spend it on a Louis Vuitton handbag.   What does money mean to you in your life?  To be honest, I have two definitions: one from my upbringing, and the one I have now.  Growing up, I associated money with power and respect.  Since moving to the U.S., money has become a piece a paper and nothing more. It just brings you to the next point in life.   What are some savings goals of yours?  A goal of mine is to be able to keep getting by and have some money to be able to afford rent in San Francisco. I’d also like to be able to take care of myself because I have a surgery coming up. Lastly, I want to be able to pay off one of my high-interest credit cards. "}
{"prompt":"Making Fee-Free Financial Services Available to Everyone","completion":" The California Public Banking Option Act, or  BankCal , is an initiative to establish a public bank in California with basic consumer banking services, such as checking and savings. The bill builds upon programs such as CalSavers and CalKids, which aim to address the racial wealth gap in the state, by helping all Californians have access to safe and affordable banking services. Right now, 1 in 2 Black and Latino households, and 1 in 4 California households lack access to basic financial services—paying proportionately more to access the money they earn, lack secure means to save, and have fewer opportunities to build credit.   BankCal would offer every Californian the opportunity to open a zero-fee, zero-penalty debit account and debit card, direct deposit from employers and for public benefits, electronic bill pay to registered payees, and an infrastructure to help account holders build credit.   BankCal does  not  create a new bank. Instead, it creates a statewide retail banking option through which every California worker can access zero-cost financial services. All Californians would be eligible to opt-in to BankCal, and participation would be voluntary.

{"prompt":"Kirsten’s Story: Adjusting to Life in Lockdown","completion":" Meet Kirsten, who lives with her sons and fiancé in Myrtle Beach, SC.    Who’s in your family?  I have two boys and a fiancé who’s basically a husband at this point. My youngest, Grayson, is five years old, and my oldest, Peyton, is seven years old. It’s hard managing two boys, but it’s manageable.   What’s your profession?  Before our city was shut down like a month ago due to coronavirus, I used to do DoorDash and Grubhub. Working for DoorDash was great because I created my own schedule. I used to wait tables, but I hated having a schedule and working until 5 or 10pm. With the flexibility to work when I wanted, I was able to watch my boys at all their sports games. I was able to work my way up to the point that I could turn the app on or off and not have to worry about getting every order.  Now, I just sell things on eBay and Mercari. They’re both great because people are online shopping from their homes.  What does a day in your life currently look like?   Nowadays, we wake up, I cook breakfast for myself and the boys, and then we’ll do homeschool. We start with Grayson, my youngest, then work on Peyton’s homework. My youngest got accepted into his preschool’s early childhood development program. After homeschool is done for the day, we do crafts together, I make dinner, we have our outside time, we come back inside to watch a movie, and then it’s time to put the boys to bed. My husband comes home from work around dinner time, so we get to do our boys’ night routine together.  My fiancé and I still have date night when we can. If we really wanted, we would have the weekends to ourselves because my mother-in-law and nana are really close by. My mother-in-law lives next door to us, and my nana lives behind us. We have 10 acres all around us, so we’ve got a lot of space.   My mom is actually going to keep my boys for what would’ve been their spring break next week, so they’ll get to see their nana and papa. They’ve been spending time with their nana since this all started. My boys haven’t gone anywhere except her house and neither have we.    What do your kids think about what’s going on right now?  They’ve dealt with the lockdown well, but the biggest thing they don’t understand why they can’t go to the grocery store with me like they usually do. That’s the only place I ever go now. Neither of my boys have left the house since this whole thing started. We try to keep them on schedule with school since they have e-learning packets that we submit every two weeks. My youngest keeps begging me, “Can I please go to the dollar store with you?”  In terms of crafts, Peyton is helping my fiancé dig a trench in our backyard for the boys’ new playground.  How has the shelter-in-place mandate affected your family?  We’re trying to be as careful as we can. Grayson, my youngest, got sick when he was really young. We were in the pediatric ICU for some time, and he was in a medically induced coma for three weeks of his time there. His lung condition is fine now, but we’ve had to go a cardiologist every six months since then. I don’t know how the coronavirus could affect him because he had prior lung issues, so we’re taking precautions. My mother-in-law has COPD and my nana is 83-years old, so we’re watching out for them as well.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  I haven’t been working, but we’re still paying two car payments. My fiancé Ray recently said, “We have money right now. How crazy would it be to work DoorDash and take an unnecessary health risk?” It’s not worth it. We have a bit of a cushion that we have if we need it.  What would you like to do after this is all over?  We really want to go on vacation to Gatlinburg. That’s what we had planned to do next week. We also want to take our sons to see their first baseball game.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I love the website and what it’s about. I love using it, and I think it’s a great tool. I’ve only been a member for two months, but I’ve been using SaverLife to help me save up for a car payment. "}
{"prompt":"Ines’s Story: Living Within Her Means","completion":" Meet Ines, a financial coach for the community nonprofit IronBound, who lives with her three children and husband in North New Jersey.  What do you do?  I’ve been a financial coach for a little over a year. I work for a nonprofit social service corporation called Ironbound Community Corporation.   It’s right up my alley because I have a major in finance and a minor in psychology. I get to help community members who aren’t familiar with budgeting and money management using my education and own best practices.   I’m self-taught and a self-learner. My nonprofit doesn’t offer training, but they try to send us to workshops and helpful events. When I first got there, there wasn’t anyone who trained me to do what I do now. It’s all about trial and error when assisting community members.   I love what I do and I plan to stay here as long as the position is available. I say that because as a nonprofit, we’re always looking for funding.   What did your childhood teach you about money?  There wasn’t really any financial education during my childhood. My parents didn’t teach me the value of money because they didn’t receive any that they can pass down to me and my siblings.   Now as a financial coach, I see the importance of starting to teach kids at a young age.   As a child, I was never really taught how to save. As a young adult, when you start earning income, you think you could do anything you want with your money. I wasn’t taught about saving money or saving for big purchases. Money came and went out; there was no savings for financial goals.   When have you felt most financially secure?  I think it was after I graduated college and got my first job. I still lived with my parents and I had a full-time job that was helping me pay for my immediate expenses. Back then, I didn’t have any priorities, so I didn’t have to worry about monthly expenses. Now, my mentality is different from when I was single. My priorities have changed now that I am married and have three kids.    What’s the best piece of financial advice you tell your clients?  I always tell them to keep in mind: what is your financial goal? Ask yourself, “Is this (impulse buying) worth you not having the money you want to save up for your goal?” That’s my thought process.   What’s your thought process when saving up for something?   Once I have a financial goal in mind, I keep thinking about my purchases. Is this purchase going to keep me from getting one step closer to my goal? Sometimes I have to give up something I want at the moment for something I want later in life.   What are your financial goals?  In the long-term, I want to be able to purchase a home for my family. I’m currently renting, but it’s getting more expensive. I don’t like the idea of renting when I know that I could be putting that money towards purchasing my own house.   In the short-term, I want to pay off my car because right now I’m in a leasing agreement, and as a financial coach I learned that it’s not the best option. My goal is to buy my car out by the end of this year and then focus on building up my savings to purchase a home.   What does a financial achievement look like for you or your clients?  Financial achievement is being on track with your finances. At the end of the day, you want to learn and be able to live within your means. It’s living outside of what you can afford—that’s the problem. I try to help my clients change their money habits. That’s also something I try to keep in mind for myself as well.   Get used to living with what you can afford so you’re never in a situation where you feel financially stressed.   What does money mean to you in your life?  It’s a tool to survive and put food on the table. I don’t like to look at it that way, but that’s how I view it.   As a financial coach, do you teach your kids any money lessons?  My kids are still very little (four-year-old, three-year-old, and one-year-old), so they haven’t had any real exposure to money. When they get a little older, I’ll obviously teach them. When we go to the supermarket, I explain to them we can only get things we can afford, and I try to teach them through those experiences.   How did you feel about winning $50 from the SaverLife Tax Time Pledge?  I’m always trying to make money, so it was a really nice surprise! That’s $50 that’ll go towards my kids’ savings. Every extra bit of money I get, I put into my kids’ savings funds. I hope it’ll help them with funding their education.  "}
{"prompt":"Week 1 Stash Cash Quiz Results","completion":" Here are the results from our first holiday savings quiz! Scroll through to see what members answered and  take the quiz yourself .  1. I regularly save for things like travel, cars, and gifts.   It’s essential to save for future expenses like travel, cars, and gifts, so you don’t go into debt or miss a bill in order to cover the cost. Make sure you are including short-term expenses in your budget!  2. I set aside money for emergencies monthly.   Saving is about consistency, not the dollar amount. Saving $5 a week is better than not saving at all. If you struggle to save, use the guidance in this article,  3 Reasons to Set Up an Automatic Plan , to start saving. Saving is about consistency, not the dollar amount. Saving $5 a week is better than not saving at all.  3. Which of these best describes how you see yourself?   Being self-aware of your spending habits helps you identify and develop ways to control your spending. For instance, if you overspend on eating out or shopping, you may decide only to use cash or wait for 24 hours before buying anything.  4. Are you able to save?   Your mindset about saving can affect your ability to save. Even if you can only save $5 a week, it’s still a savings win!  5. What’s a rule of thumb for how much to save for emergencies?   A rule of thumb from most financial professionals is to save 3 to 6 months of expenses. This amount helps you cover a few months of job loss or major expenses like needing a new car transmission.   6. What’s a good reason to save money?   Prevent the financial “sticker shock” of having to pay for short-term expenses by saving a small amount monthly to cover the cost. For instance, if you have a $200 budget for expenses, save $50 a month for four months.  7. What does “pay yourself first” mean?   “Paying yourself first” is all about prioritizing saving to cover the unexpected before spending money on other expenses. It’s shifting how you manage your money to a “savings mentality.” This means when you get paid, save part of your paycheck and decide how to spend the rest.

{"prompt":"Kimm’s Story: Surviving the Coronavirus Lockdown","completion":" Meet Kimm, a hairdresser who lives with her children and granddaughter in Houston, Texas.  Who’s in your family?  Me, my kids, and my granddaughter.  What do you do?  Before the coronavirus hit, I was a hairdresser. That’s my life. I’ve been doing that for over 17 years. But I haven’t had an appointment for the past few weeks because of the coronavirus.  What does a day in your life look like during the coronavirus crisis? How is your family coping?  I don’t have a vehicle, so getting around is hard. Currently I’m waiting for my daughter to call back so she can help me get around. She works for a delivery – she does DoorDash. She’s the only one who can work right now since she has the vehicle. She’s 24. I’m praying for her because she’s with child, and she’s out there being exposed to the virus. They have an app – if it’s near, she grabs food from the restaurant and delivers it. She only does 2-3 dashes a day since there are so many people doing the same thing around the area.  How are you staying afloat financially?  I’m just trying to survive, period.   I found a website where you could get a raffle ticket for a laptop. My kids start school online on Monday but they don’t have a laptop or technology to do that.  It’s mandatory for my kids to be in school because there are lesson plans on there, but we don’t have a laptop for them to do work on.  As far as my granddaughter – there’s a packet of food for her. There was a food pantry we were supposed to go to yesterday, but we were a bit too late to get food.   Where are you turning to for resources like food and shelter?  We’ll go to my kids’ school tomorrow for food.  What are you doing right now to help stay grounded during this situation?  It’s just frustrating, to be honest. I’m feeling as if I’m failing my children. I have never had to tell them I didn’t have anything for them to eat.  What do you envision for your family’s future?  After the coronavirus is over, I’m thinking about moving closer to Fort Worth where my daughter is. She’s the one who’s currently working for DoorDash.  I’ll have to start over again. I’m from New Orleans. I was there during Hurricane Katrina.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather the coronavirus crisis?  I have already depleted every account, including my savings. I joined a few freelance websites like Veryable, Wonolo, and Trulancer. Not having my car has a huge impact on my ability to work right now.  What does money mean to you in your life?  I see money as a means for survival. Although money isn’t everything and it can’t really bring you happiness, you need it to be able to make ends meet.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  SaverLife has actually been a life saver. The Aunt Bertha has given me tons of resources. Before this disaster, I signed up for SaverLife not knowing how useful it would become. "}

{"prompt":"Michael’s Story: Keep Pressing Onward","completion":" Meet Michael, a homeless shelter employee and aspiring truck driver who lives in Little Rock, Arkansas.  What does your day-to-day look like right now?  I just completed an eight-month recovery program here at the homeless shelter. Next week, I’m starting truck driving school. It’s 20 weeks of classes. I don’t know where I’ll be placed after I graduate from the school, but I hope it’s somewhere close by.  In the short term, I do want to be able to have an emergency fund. Here at the shelter, they try to teach about finances and things like that, but the class is only 45 minutes and meets just once a week.  What have you learned so far in that class?  Not much. We’re reading  The Money Answer Book  by Dave Ramsey right now. It’s kind of simple, common sense advice like “don’t use credit cards to pay for debt.”  What do you wish you were learning?  I want to learn how to better manage my money. I’ve never had a credit card before, but I have spent a lot of money in my life. I’d really like to be thrifty with my money. It’d also be helpful to learn how to have an emergency fund and how much I should put in there.   What do you do?  Right now, I’m working 42 hours a week at the shelter. I get to help out in the kitchen. It gives me a stipend of $40 every two weeks. I’m using that to pay my phone bill and bus pass. My phone bill is $50 (used to be $60), and my bus pass is $36 every month. The bus company has a discount for students, so I’m going to see if I can get a deal since I’m in trade school. Now I’ve added the cost of $52 for my truck driving class. I couldn’t quite afford that with my monthly stipend, so the director of the course said I could work part-time for him to make up the difference.  What’s nice is that I don’t have to worry about a food bill. At least not yet. I eat at the shelter, which has helped me save lots of money.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I remember my dad was thrifty, but my mom called him cheap. We didn’t run out of anything though. He made sure all four of us kids and my mom ate. We ate beans and potatoes and things like that—simple, home cooked meals. He was the kind of guy who didn’t buy anything stupid.   My upbringing influenced me a lot. Like, I know it’s cheaper to prepare your own food. As a truck driver, I know that I won’t be able to do that as much, so I’ll have to save in other ways. I was thinking I could put together sandwiches for the road.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Always have something to fall back on so you can last two weeks or a month without any income.  What are your goals for the future?  With truck driving, I have the opportunity to get a local job here after I graduate. There’s this program at the shelter where you can stay a year or two as you save up money. I was thinking of doing that because I want to be able to save enough money to get established somewhere modest or humble. "}
{"prompt":"Nicole’s Story: Live on Less Than You Earn","completion":" Meet Nicole, a social worker and mother of two in Atlanta, Georgia.  What do you do?  Right now, I’m working in logistics, but I was a social worker for a very long time. When I got married and had my kids, I took a break from social work because it’s a very involved career. So now I work in a logistics facility that’s about ten minutes away from my house.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  Growing up, my mom was a single mom taking care of four kids. I learned that there’s never going to be enough. Because my mom had divorced my dad and was taking care of us by herself, she just never had enough. She would work all month just to make ends meet for that month, then start all over again.  Not to discredit her, but she didn’t teach us a lot about finances. She just emphasized, make sure you finish school and get a good job.  What is your lowest financial point?  Three years ago, I decided to move back to Atlanta even though my husband was on the fence about moving. We were renting in Charlotte, but I had a townhouse in Atlanta with a big mortgage. I didn’t want to be paying rent when I was also paying a mortgage on a house I owned!  So we separated for five months and I moved down by myself. I had to declare bankruptcy. I was doing things that were not fiscally sound. I was making good money, but I couldn’t even see it because I was spending it so fast. I was spending it foolishly, frivolously. I was reckless.  How did you make a change?  My older sister is a finance guru – she can squeeze a nickel like no one else. She’s an accountant and exceptionally frugal.  When I got in a bad state, I called her. She sent me an Excel spreadsheet with a sample budget. We got all my bills, put them into separate piles: things I had to pay, things I could pay off in bankruptcy, and things I could get rid of.  After that, I started bagging lunches. I give myself one day a week as a treat to go out to eat, with a $10 maximum. I just had to make fiscally responsible decisions.  I also got more careful about bank fees. If it’s not my ATM, I’m not going to use it. I’m not going to pay $5 to get my own money.  These are little things, but they add up over time. I had to put more thought into everything I did.  My brother was in the service, and he took me to Navy Federal, so I opened a separate savings account. So now $35 per pay period goes into that account. It doesn’t sound like much, but it adds up. It could be Christmas money, but it’s not going to be everyday money. And it’s just going to sit there out of reach and accrue interest.  What is your highest financial point?  Right around now is a high point for me! I’ve learned better money management and financial skills  and  I’m actually putting them into practice. I’m doing things in a positive way and I am doing it purposefully – not because I have to, but because I want a different way.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Live on less than you earn. Don’t owe people money.  I read it on Facebook. When I was at my lowest financial point, I was scrolling on FB and I had an epiphany, a moment of clarity –  I do that, I spend every dollar I earn, and I’m not saving anything.  What are your goals for the future?  I would like to own two more properties: a house outside of Charlotte because I like that area, and a house somewhere else. At the end of the day, I want to be able to gift both of my daughters a home, so that when they start their lives out, they don’t have to worry about bills.  I would like to be able to work and have that money go into investments. I want to work because I love what I do, not because I have to work to live.   My five-year-old is graduating from pre-k and will be school age soon. I told myself that I just need to get both of my babies into school, then I’ll go back to social work. I actually just got a call back on an interview to be a program coordinator for a nonprofit!  Nicole’s two daughters, her motivation for saving  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money used to be really important to me. Now it’s not so much. Now it’s more a medium for exchange. You can’t be a slave to it. You have to learn to master it. You have to learn how to not be a slave to money, but at the same time be very responsible with it.  I’ve had times when I was working working working. I worked so much that I rarely came home. I had spent all this money on furniture, but I was never home to enjoy it because I was paying it off! I had to work all the time to keep up with the Joneses, to keep up with the lifestyle that I thought I wanted.  At the end of the day, I realized that these material things don’t matter. You need money, but you don’t need as much as you think you need, especially if you’re more cautious with the money you have. Maybe you don’t need more money, you just need to do more with what you have. "}

{"prompt":"Edna’s Story: Debt-Free Since 2017","completion":" Meet Edna, a speech pathologist who lives with her daughter in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Did the pandemic impact you?  I’m a self-employed speech pathologist. Fortunately, I wasn’t financially affected by the pandemic. If anything, my business grew. I attribute that to running my business on the leaner side before COVID. Initially, there was a month where I didn’t see anyone in person, but by summer, I was completely booked.  My daughter is in fifth grade currently. Her school has been online since the pandemic started last year. She’s looking forward to going back in person very soon! I recently set up in-person tutoring for her, so she’s doing those 2 – 3 days a week.  Have you and your daughter talked about money management?  My daughter has her own bank account. She gets an allowance based on certain things she does. Right now, she’s saving for games and college. I’m proud that she’s learned the value of money.  Tell me more about your business.  I started my Speech Path business in 2018 and was fully self-sufficient by 2019. When the pandemic hit, I’d only been on my own for 6-7 months. I knew that even if I didn’t have clients, I would be okay because I had saved up a year’s worth of living expenses.   What is your history with paying off debt?  In 2012, I started to get serious about paying off my debt. I had a reality check in 2016 when my dad got really sick. I decided I needed to get out of debt  permanently  and create a better financial plan for the future. The Budgetnista’s Facebook Group, Dream Catchers, introduced me to SaverLife.   SaverLife has helped me be more accountable with my savings. I’ve learned to pay myself first, which includes paying off my debt. I was debt-free by the end of 2017. I thought, “I don’t want to go down this road again.”     Once I became debt-free, I put aside the same amount of money I’d use to pay off my debt into a savings account. I took a part-time job that went straight to paying off my debt. The pandemic reminded me how important it is to have an emergency fund. If I’d kept up with my old financial habits, things could’ve gone the other way. After I built my emergency fund, I learned more about investing. That’s helped me a lot because I was about to build my own business without taking out any loans.  When I was in debt, I would pay off debt and put money in savings first. I unfollowed a lot of people and companies on social media that I felt would tempt me to use my credit card and spend money on unnecessary items. I was lucky enough to have found an accountability partner.  How did you find out about SaverLife?  I found out about SaverLife a few years ago when it was called EARN. SaverLife has definitely helped me save. Today, I have multiple savings accounts totaling up to about $40,000. If it wasn’t for SaverLife, I still would have gotten there, but it would have taken a  lot  longer.   Saving money became easier after I was able to stash away $5,000. That was the magic number for me. Up until then, it felt like every time I put money in my emergency fund, something would happen and I’d need to use my savings.   What are your favorite SaverLife features?  I like going on the  community forum  to chat with other members about their experiences with money. The  Money 101 articles  are really helpful, too. Lastly, I like the ongoing  savings challenges . Since joining, I’ve referred many people to SaverLife.  What would you tell someone who’s thinking about joining SaverLife?  Remember that savings doesn’t happen overnight. There are no shortcuts. Know that there are other members in the community forum and in the  Saver Stories section  that are in similar financial situations. The pattern of saving will not be a linear trajectory.  "}
{"prompt":"Answers to Your 5 Most Common Questions About Voting","completion":" When you vote, you help create and nurture a better society. People in your community are going to be voting. Are you going to be one of them?  Your vote counts, both in national elections (like the upcoming presidential election) as well as those in your town and state. The decisions you make and the leaders you elect have an impact on your life, so creating the future you want to have begins with a vote.     A lot of people intend to vote, but you need to read the fine print to make sure you’ll be able to vote.  Read our last article  to figure out whether you’re already registered, then read this one for next steps to register to vote.  1. How can I register to vote?  The voter registration process is similar from state to state, with some variations. Typically, there are up to three ways you can register to vote:  In person . You can register to vote on election day right at your polling place in some states. In others, you must register 7 days or 30 days in advance. Check your state’s rules carefully. By mail . Some states require mail-in registration be postmarked 30 days in advance.  Online . Some states require advanced online registration; others allow it on election day.   If you vote in person or online, you will get instant verification that you are registered to vote. If you mail in your registration, you may not receive verification. You will need to check later to ensure you’re successfully registered.  Vote.gov  has great state-by-state resources for voter registration. Enter your state or territory, and you’ll see critical basic information:  The primary way to register in your state Alternate ways to register in your state (for instance, to register to vote by mail) Voter registration deadlines in your state The next general election day  2. What are the voting requirements in my state?  In addition to registering to vote, you must be eligible to vote in the first place. You cannot vote if you are not a citizen, even if you are a permanent legal resident of the U.S. You also cannot vote for president in the general election if you live in a U.S. territory, even if you’re a citizen.  In almost every state, you must also be 18 years old by or on election day. Here is a  chart  with age requirements for voting in every state.   Some states have other eligibility requirements as well. Check with your  state election office .  3. Can I vote if I have been convicted of a felony in the past?  Rules vary from state to state. In Maine and Vermont, you retain voting rights even while in prison. If you were released from prison, your voting rights are restored automatically in many states. In others, you must first complete parole and probation before you can legally vote again. In California and Connecticut, you can vote while on probation. And in eight states, voting rights restoration depends on the date or type of your conviction, repayment of fines, and outcome of your petition to the government or gubernatorial pardon.  For more information, research the  rules in your state .  4. Can I vote if I am experiencing homelessness and do not have a home address?  While most states require a home address in order to register to vote, that does not mean you can’t vote if you’re currently experiencing homelessness. Persons experiencing homelessness can register and vote in all 50 states.  Nonprofitvote.org  recommends that you list a shelter address where you can receive mail as your voting address. You may also denote a street corner or park as your residence.   5. If I have a disability, can I vote, and how?

{"prompt":"Courtney’s Story: Pursuing the F.I.R.E. Lifestyle","completion":" Meet Courtney, a Membership & Business Development Director for a Chamber of Commerce who lives in Connecticut  What’s your profession?  I’m the Membership & Business Development Director for a local Chamber of Commerce here in Connecticut.  What does your day-to-day look like?  It’s pretty standard these days. I wake up, go to work, then go home. Since the COVID-19 pandemic pretty much shut most things down, there’s not much to do. Whenever I have some time to myself, I like to unwind by watching tv or managing my online side business. And every so often, I’ll take day or weekend trips here and there.  Can you tell me more about your side business?  I’m a reseller. So, I go thrifting or family and friends bring me their clothes to sell for them. Reselling clothing has helped me hit my financial goals over the last two years.  How’d you get into the business of reselling?  My niece was at my house one day and showed me the Poshmark app. I started off selling jewelry and moved onto selling clothing, too. During the pandemic, I’ve actually brought in an extra $2,000 a month through this side hustle.   Do you have any student loans? What does paying them down look like?  I do have student loans left. At the time I got the loans, I was so lucky that the interest rate at the time was 2.5%. Now that I look back on it, I should have paid them off sooner. It’s only been in the last two years that I really focused on taking care of the last of my remaining student loans. The federal moratorium on student loans has been really helpful. I’ve definitely taken advantage of the temporary 0% interest rate. My plan is to keep paying my loans down as much as I can.  What does budgeting look like for you?  About two years ago, a friend introduced me to Dave Ramsey. She gave me a pre-made Excel sheet, so, all I had to do was input my income and expenses, and it took the work out of manually having to budget. Every two weeks, I update the spreadsheet. What was nice was that everything is down to the penny. After my expenses and like groceries and gas, whatever is leftover I put into savings.  Are you saving for anything in particular?  Normally I’d be saving for vacations or concerts, but now I’ve been blessed with being able to put that money into my savings. I don’t know if I would’ve gotten better at saving had it not been for the pandemic.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather the pandemic?  Fortunately, I haven’t had to dip into my savings. I’ve just been using my savings buckets to pay for investments like my house. Besides my savings buckets, I don’t touch my emergency fund.  Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  I moved from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage. At 35 years old, I’m very proud of this accomplishment! My ultimate goal is to pay off my house by the time I’m 50 years old. Ultimately, I’d like to retire with a million dollars and retire as early as possible. "}
{"prompt":"Kelly’s Story: Job Searching During the Coronavirus Pandemic","completion":" Meet Kelly, an attorney who’s living with her family in Branchburg, NJ.   Tell me what it’s like where you live.  For the time being, I’m in Branchburg, New Jersey. The governor ordered everything to shut down, and most establishments—except for the restaurants—are closed.   I’m living with relatives right now.  Do you have a profession?  I’m an attorney by trade, but right now I’m in the midst of a career change. I’m currently looking for a new position in the human resources field. I wasn’t really satisfied with the legal world, so I wanted to do something that was more interesting to me.   There are a lot of transferrable skills between law and human resources, and I’m interested in employment law specifically.   Has your job search been impacted by the coronavirus?  Yes. It’s definitely harder for me to find open positions. A lot of companies are either not hiring right now or hiring has diminished.  What does a day in your life currently look like?  A typical day includes job search seminars and networking seminars throughout the day. I might have a job search seminar at 10am, then a networking meeting at 1pm, and then maybe another job search seminar at 3pm. In between those seminars and meetings, I’m looking for and applying to different positions.  Have you filed for unemployment?   No. I haven’t done so because I had some system issues when I was trying to create an account. I contacted the Department of Labor, but unfortunately no one has gotten back to me yet.  How is your family coping with what’s going on in the world?  They’re doing as well as they can. In addition to wearing gloves and using hand sanitizer, they wear masks when they go out for essential errands, which is not often.   What do you envision for your future?  Full-time employment, with significant pay, at a position I enjoy.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  Yes, I did actually have to use my savings recently. I used what I had to pay for rent and groceries.   What does money mean to you in your life?  Money means freedom to create your own opportunities, such as a business, without relying on others to provide an opportunity for you.  Did you have any money lessons growing up?  Yes. I learned how to save money in a savings account, a money market account, and CD’s.  What does your budgeting look like these days?  My budget is sparse. Most of my money is allocated for food and gasoline.  Are you able to save money right now?  I save a small amount.   "}
{"prompt":"Princess’s Story: The Glue That Holds Her Family Together","completion":" Meet Princess, a full-time college student and part-time caregiver who lives with her mom in Springfield, Virginia.  How do you like living in Virginia?  I really like where I live because it’s near where my family is and it’s also close to my college, George Mason University. It’s also near Washington D.C., which is nice. The only downside is that the cost of living is expensive.  What’s your profession?  Besides going to school full-time, I work part-time as a caregiver. What I do is called companionship. Most days, I care for this older lady who has physical disabilities and can’t care for herself. I assist her in things like changing clothes, exercising, feeding her, and helping her walk. Her residence is only about a 15 to 20-minute drive away, so it’s in a pretty convenient location. Before my school closed because of the coronavirus, I would go straight to her residence right after school.  What are you studying in college?  I’m currently studying Accounting because I like math. Before this, I was earning my associate degree in Engineering from Northern Virginia Community College. I decided to switch majors because it cost me less credits overall to earn a degree in Accounting than it did for Engineering, 66 credits instead of 75.  Currently, I have classes four days a week, and spend about 12 to 15 hours in class. This doesn’t include the amount of time I spend on my purely online classes. That workload hasn’t changed.   Purely online classes due to the coronavirus are a bit tough right now because the owners of the house I’m renting a room in can’t afford Wi-Fi. Actually, SaverLife resources have helped me find companies that are giving free Wi-Fi for 60 days, so I’m exploring that as an option. My school’s library is closed, so I can’t go there for Wi-Fi either.  What’s your living situation like?  Right now, my mom and I are renting a room in someone’s house for $450 a month, and my two older siblings are staying with my grandma in her two-bedroom condominium. It’s a bit crowded at her condo since my grandma also has her daughter and other grandkids living with her. Including my older brother and older sister, there are about seven people total living in her two-bedroom condo.  My mom and I are renting an apartment so we can continue to petition for my dad to come here from the Philippines and can have a place for him to stay when he arrives. Once he’s here, we’re going to try and find a place big enough to house my mom, dad, brother, sister, and me.  Are you currently saving up for anything?  We’re all trying to save up for a two-bedroom condo for my whole family, which includes my mom, dad, older brother, and older sister. We’d really like to have our own place to call home.   What does a day in your life currently look like?   These days, I’m a bit less productive. I’m used to getting up early around 9am and then getting ready to go to school. I usually have more energy in the morning since I’m physically getting ready to go somewhere. Knowing you’re not going somewhere is hard. Some days I don’t brush my teeth in the morning to go to my online class. I feel a bit guilty because I feel like I don’t do much during the day.  Also, I’m the only driver in the family, so I pick and drop everyone off to their jobs or wherever they need to go. My mom works at Popeyes six days a week and doesn’t take Uber or the bus. She said she’s scared of using public transportation because of coronavirus.  I’m looking forward to teaching my older brother how to drive. He and my older sister earned their college degrees in the Philippines, and they’re pretty new to Virginia.   The situation is tough, but I’m hoping it’ll be better soon. I guess the one upside of coronavirus is that I don’t have to drive to school and pay for as much gas these days.  What would you like to do after everything is back to normal?   I think I’ll go back to doing what I did before, which is take classes at school and save money for summer.  It’d be great if I could teach both my older siblings how to drive so they could drive themselves to their jobs.  What’s been your experience with SaverLife?  It’s really good. I was introduced to SaverLife by a former professor and mentor, Mrs. Diana. She was a professor at my community college as well as George Mason University, where I currently go to school. She was hired by the school to help new students with their financial aid. I believe she helps students with VITA tax services. Once I saw her on the SaverLife website and asked her what it was. I have her to thank for helping me buy a car.   SaverLife has helped me save. Before I was introduced to SaverLife, I didn’t really know how to budget, and I wasn’t aware of where my money was going. I learned the 80/20 rule from SaverLife.   There are so many resources that you can read on the site. I’ve read articles about filing taxes for free, and I’m learning how to save and pay off debt. SaverLife also offered the opportunity to talk to a financial coach, so I’m getting ready to set up an appointment to discuss my finances. I’m getting my questions ready. "}
{"prompt":"Meet Our Super Saver Grand Prize Winner!","completion":" Tara is our first ever Super Saver winner.  Tara lives in Roselle Park, New Jersey and has been a dedicated SaverLife member for two years. Tara is one of SaverLife’s most engaged members, and we’re grateful to have her as part of our community.   What’s your history with personal finance?  I grew up with not a lot of money. We were the poor people in town. One of my big goals when I started working was to save money and make sure I didn’t have to worry about where my next meal was coming from like I did as a kid. I try to save as much as possible.   Why is saving money important to you?   It’s so scary to not have money. I grew up not having money and don’t ever want to feel that way again.   How long have you been a SaverLife member?  I signed up for it two years ago. I must have read an article about it. I learned what SaverLife was, that if you linked your bank account, they would track it for six months, and if you manage to save $20 every month we’ll give you $20 at the end. I thought, “Okay, I can do that.”   Then I got an email about Scratch & Save. That was cool because it became like a game. I set up an automatic transfer so every week those $5 got transferred into my bank account and I get the scratcher. I’m utilizing all of SaverLife’s benefits. It’s so great!   What has your savings journey been like in the past few years?   I have been trying very hard to save. Emergencies happen and you have to dip into savings, and it’s an uphill battle to replenish those savings. SaverLife has helped me to bucket off my money so I have a true savings account. SaverLife is absolutely helping me save more money. It’s given me different goals to reach for.  What has SaverLife taught you?   The best part about SaverLife is it takes away the taboo of talking about money. SaverLife is the friend I can have and talk to about money with. It holds me accountable for the promises I make and goals I want to reach.   SaverLife has taught me that money isn’t scary. It’s taught me to do what I can. Everyone has to dip into emergency funds every once in a while. Every week is a new week and every month is a new month, and even if you can’t get that $5 for Scratch & Save this week–next week is a new week. You can always save in the future.   What are you going to use the prize money for?  A dream of mine is to max out my IRA, which is $6,000. Get a couple Christmas presents. I don’t know what I’m going to do! This is awesome.  "}
{"prompt":"5 Troubleshooting Tips for Linking Your Account","completion":" Linking your account to SaverLife opens up so many new doors along your saving journey! We want to make sure you have every SaverLife benefit available to you. Here are six tips for linking your account ⬇️  1. Double check your password and account credentials  This is the most common issue we see, and the easiest one to fix! Double check that you’re using the correct and most up-to-date version of your bank login password. If you are using a password saver that auto-fills your password, it may have an older version of your password saved. To see if this is the issue, log in to SaverLife in an incognito browser and try entering your bank credentials manually.  2. Try again in 12 hours  Unfortunately, sometimes the best thing to do is to wait then try again. For security reasons, if you enter the incorrect password too many times or your session expires, you may need to wait 12-36 hours. This clears up the issue for many people!  3. Try PayPal  If you’re unable to link your preferred bank account, try linking your PayPal account. Psssst, and when you win savings challenges, you can choose to have your cash reward sent straight to your PayPal! It’s like a little boost for your rainy day fund.  4. Open a new account  Another alternative is to open a dedicated savings account. SaverLife financial expert Linda Jacob has this to say about  savings accounts : “They have limited withdrawals, but usually only a $100 minimum in order to avoid a monthly fee. This account generally has a higher interest rate than a checking account, but lower than a money market account.”  5. Reach out to our member support team  If none of the above tips work for you or you need additional help, our member support team is always happy to troubleshoot any account linking issues you may have.  ***  And when you feel comfortable with how much you’ve saved in your emergency fund, consider starting a  sinking fund  for your not-so-unexpected-expenses like monthly bills, an upcoming car expense, or a family vacation.  Here are just a handful of benefits you’ll receive when you link your account:  You can participate in savings challenges like the Race to $100 When you save $5 each week, you’ll earn 250 points—enough to redeem a  Scratch & Save  card You’ll be able to set a 30-day savings goal and track your progress toward achieving it Many more features coming soon!

{"prompt":"SaverLife Helps Connecticut Graduate Student to Avoid Debt and Build Savings","completion":" Celina learned about SaverLife from her local United Way and recently won $200 in a savings challenge.   Celina was working as a case manager for a local nonprofit in New Haven, CT when she heard about SaverLife. A representative from United Way’s ALICE saves program, which helps families develop long-term savings habits, presented information to Celina’s clients about the benefits of using SaverLife.   Celina quickly signed up for SaverLife.  “I don’t like to recommend something unless I’ve tried it myself,” Celina said.   In the nearly two years since she became a SaverLife member, Celina has prioritized saving.  “Saving is one of the most important things I can do for myself,” she said. “SaverLife has helped me become more diligent with my savings habit.”    Not only has SaverLife helped Celina create a savings habit, but Celina also connected with a Neighborhood Trust financial advisor who helped her assess her goals and set up a budget. Her savings helped her make ends meet when she was laid off in January 2020. Now, she’s using SaverLife to help her pay for her graduate degree in social work.   “I was able to pay for my first year of graduate school without taking out any loans, and I’m on track to do the same for my second year. SaverLife has taught me that every $5 counts,” Celina said.   In the summer of 2021, Celina participated in a savings challenge and won $200 from SaverLife. The money came at the perfect time to help her pay the property taxes on her car without dipping into her savings.   When she graduates next year, Celina hopes to become a community organizer. She plans to continue saving and encourages others to make SaverLife part of their financial journey.   “Joining SaverLife is one of the best things you can do for yourself—and it’s completely free!” "}

{"prompt":"Anastacia’s Story: Helping Others in a Time of Need","completion":" Meet Anastacia, an intensive in-home counselor who lives in Roanoke, West Virginia.  What’s it like where you live?  I’ve lived in Roanoke for eight years now. I live with my boyfriend and two roommates in a house. We’re actually getting ready to move with our roommates to a new home in the same community!  My boyfriend and I aren’t sure about our plans for buying a house in the very near future, because we’re not sure where we’ll be at that point in our lives. We may move to a surrounding state soon.   What do you like about your community?  I like the Roanoke area because it’s very outdoor oriented. Everyone here in the community either runs, hikes, or bikes. We’re all very involved in our community and we support one another.  What’s your profession?  I am an intensive in-home counselor. That means I provide services to at-risk youth. I help them learn coping skills, anger management skills, and teach them how to deescalate the situation from getting physical so they don’t have to be removed from their home.  I’m going to be celebrating my two-year anniversary at this job soon.  What does a day in your life currently look like during the coronavirus lockdown?  It really depends on what I have to do because no one day is the same. Our office has had to adjust from providing face-to-face care to doing telehealth. My current schedule is a lot different than what it used to be. I’ve ended up having a lot more online meetings because we’re not able to see our different supervisors and coworkers throughout the day. My colleagues and I are doing more check-ins. Nowadays, I could have several meetings back-to-back before having a check-in with a client. In addition to that, I’m constantly checking my emails and attending trainings.  How is your household coping with what’s going on in the world?  We’re all trying to be a lot more mindful and take advantage of all the down time we have. Because we’re in the process of moving, this time at home has given us the opportunity to go through our belongings. We’re cleansing and purging all the things that no longer serve a good purpose.   I’m getting together my clothes and books that I no longer use. Because of the nature of my job, I have quite the number of games and activities that I’m looking to donate. There are a few local community organizations that are accepting those types of items to give to kids in the area, so I’m currently trying to figure out the specific donation protocol. I hope to donate them either by curbside pickup or by appointment.   Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  My boyfriend and I had the perfect storm of things happen along with COVID-19. Our situation escalated right after we got back from a road trip where we attended a wedding. Our car broke down on the way back, and our budget has been off ever since.  Before all that, I was in the process of building some savings. Unfortunately, I had to use a lot of that in addition to credit. I used what we had saved to pay for our hotel, rental car, and car repair. Now we’re trying to do damage control, build our savings, and pay off the debt that incurred.   What would you like to do after this is all over?  I mostly want to visit some family members that I haven’t been able to see for a while. My stepdad is immunosuppressed and just finished up a round of chemotherapy, and he lives two hours away. It’s been a month since I’ve seen him in person.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It usually means stress, but I’m looking to change how I actually think about it.   How did you found out about SaverLife?  I discovered SaverLife from Instagram actually, and I’ve enjoyed it so far! I think it’s been very beneficial and rewarding. I’ve taken advantage of everything that’s been offered on the site. The financial coaching has especially been helpful. I’ve gotten several cash rewards from some of the savings challenges I’ve participated in.  "}
{"prompt":"What Black History Month Means to Me: SaverLife’s Financial Coaches Reflect on Progress Made and the Work to Be Done","completion":" Black History Month is a time to reflect on how far we’ve come, as well as the road ahead to wealth equality. The percentage of black college graduates has doubled since 1990  from 11% to 25% . From 2007-2018, firms owned by black women  have gone up a whopping 164% . But, although there’s been progress, there’s a  nearly 10x wealth gap  between the typical net worth of a white family ($171,000) and the net worth of a black family ($17,150).  SaverLife financial coaches are dedicated to teaching people wealth-building habits to help  close the racial wealth gap . Below, our financial coaches write about what Black History Month means to them and their passion for helping to close the gap.  Changing My Family’s Financial Future, by Tania Brown, CFP  I grew up on welfare with a single mother. My family never talked about money, except for the lack of it. As a child, Black History Month was my reminder that your beginning does not define your future. It’s a reminder that I come from people who survived generations of unimaginable horrors yet never let go of the hope of a better future for the next generation.  These lessons never left me. While serving in the Army, I was blessed to have soldiers teach me about money. I learned that money could be a tool rather than a barrier to the future I wanted.   The moment I realized I would be the last generation in my family raised on welfare, I became determined to help as many people as I can change their financial family futures. This passion led me to a two-decade career in personal finance.  The greatest tribute I can give to all those who came before me—my mother who sacrificed everything for me, the soldiers who took me under their wings—is to serve all of you. To do anything I can to help you achieve your financial goals and change your family’s financial future.   Standing on the Shoulders of Those Who Came Before Me, by Carl Windom, AFC, FFC  As a financial coach, it gives me great satisfaction to celebrate Black History Month. I am proud to know that my lifetime effort to grow and evolve as a financial expert is a reality. In my generation, I felt free to be anything I wanted to be without pause or hesitation. As a result, I chose to study finance because I wanted to know on an expert level how money works. It is my delight to provide something of significance that can change lives and inspire people to be financially fit and well. I stand on the shoulders of many that have come before me.  As the need for financial literacy grows in the black community, so does my passion for learning and teaching financial and economic skills. As America celebrates Black History Month, I feel great pride to know that my lifetime of learning finance has empowered me to become a change leader in my community, and for many of my black brothers and sisters plus many other friends and neighbors in America and around the world. That is why Black History Month means so much to me.  Financial Health Means Freedom and Independence, by Elaine Harrison, AFC, FFC  Black History Month, and every other month, means helping others achieve financial health and wellness. As a financial coach, I strive to educate people about finances in the hope that they will achieve financial freedom.  In the Black community, financial health means more financial freedom and independence. Being able to earn, give, save, spend and invest for the future without stress is the goal. Being a part of a community that is undervalued, many may feel that financial health is unattainable. Many in the black community do not even use terms like financial health. Consistent and honest financial education—in a way that will be received—is necessary and essential.  Poor financial health in the Black community is rooted in generations of poor and misleading education and a lack of opportunity. Exploiting the black dollar is easy when you can convince someone that having more stuff like clothes, shoes, and cars makes them important. And unfair systems make it close to impossible to build wealth within the community.   During Black History Month, as well as throughout the year, SaverLife’s financial coaches are committed to your financial wellness.

{"prompt":"Meet the 2021 Tax Time Story Contest Winners!","completion":" Terri  is the Office Manager of Mock & Company Jewelry, a Black-owned business in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She and her boss,  Anthony , are the 2021 Tax Time Story Contest winners. They both won $2,500.   When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Terri was laid off from her job caring for an elderly woman. She connected with Anthony through her church and began working in the jewelry store in July 2020, eventually working her way up to full-time.   “When I saw the contest, I  instantly  thought of my boss,” she said. The contest asked SaverLife members to nominate someone they would gift their tax refund to and explain why.   Like many small business owners, the pandemic proved challenging for Anthony. After years of working in the jewelry industry, he started his own business in 2009. The pandemic forced him to look for new customers across the country.   Despite the hardships his own business was facing, Anthony was committed to helping others.   “Even though business wasn’t flourishing when the pandemic hit, he kept the shop open so his employees wouldn’t go without paychecks. He even gave us Christmas bonuses,” Terri said.    Below is Terri’s Tax Time Story Contest Submission:   “I would nominate my boss! He is a small business owner and has truly blessed many during this pandemic. Not only did he manage to give all his employees a very generous Christmas bonus, but he also paid not 1… not 2…. but 25 single moms’ utility bills during the Christmas season to help out and give them a little hope during such a trying time! And had done countless random acts of kindness for people all while running a new business taking care of his family (wife & 4 children) and making sure we never missed any of paycheck during COVID even if it came from his own personal funds! I would give him my tax return in a heartbeat just to let him know he is truly appreciated ❤️”   Anthony has always cared about giving back to his community. He was raised by a single mother, and it’s been his dream for his business to become successful enough that he can buy homes for single mothers. In 2020, he went through a local nonprofit to anonymously pay the utility bills of 20 single moms in the Pittsburgh area.   Anthony was humbled that Terri nominated him for the prize.   “It’s a blessing,” he said. “When you give with a sincere heart, it’s going to come back to you.”  Terri was “ecstatic” to find out Anthony had won.   “God has been answering so many prayers through this season,” she said. “[Anthony] can finally get something for himself! He gives so much that he rarely focuses on himself.”   Terri plans to save her portion of the prize money. She joined SaverLife five months ago and has been working on building her credit and saving for a down payment on a home. She took the 2020 Tax Time Pledge and used IRS Free File to save more money.   “I like the challenges—I signed up for the  Race to $100 ,” she said. “It gets you focused on the importance of saving.”  Anthony plans to use his portion to treat himself to a watch and save toward a down payment on a home in Florida.   “This is making me think that I want to do something bigger next year,” he said.  “Maybe pay for a camp for kids. God blessed me with this—what else can I do?”  Terri also plans to give some of her prize money away.   “I’m definitely going to pay it forward,” she said. “I won’t tell the person; they’re going to be surprised too!” "}

Who lives in your household?  Just me. I have four grown children, but one of my sons Joel died a year ago in February.  That’s part of why I’m paying off debt – for me to be able to stay with Joel at different stages of his treatment, surgeries, and dying. It pushed me to my financial limit, but no one wants to die alone, and I didn’t want that for him. My debt was also related to three funerals and being with family members prior to their deaths. After my son died, it took a few weeks to clean up his rental property and hold a memorial.  I’m blessed to have a really good church community, which helps me. I’m not in over my head right now, but on my income, it’s taking everything I’ve got to pay back my debt. I live off donated food after my EBT runs out. It’s something I worry about every day. I know that the only way I can continue is if it’s God’s will for me.  What do you do?  I’m 65 and I’ve been disabled for a long time, since 2004. I have SSI and SSA, but I am on the low end of it. I have Section 8 and EBT, which is $130/month, and I get energy assistance.  I’m trying so hard to work out a budget and live within my means if there is a way to do it.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My parents were out of the Depression era. They always tried to live off the land. They knew from the Depression that if you didn’t own your own property and have cash under your mattress, you had nothing.  I was one of the first in my family to ever finish high school or go to college. They wanted for me not to have to work as a child because they both lived through tremendous deprivation as children.   I’m 65, and I’ve been doing art since I was 6. My father was a photographer, and my mother was an amazing artist. They were both untaught and became medical photographers and artists for Dartmouth College. It wasn’t a hippie thing. They were blue collar workers and could barely get by.  Growing up, they encouraged me to go out and do what they weren’t able to do. Even though they didn’t have money to pay for it, I earned money to pay for my own ballet lessons and arts and crafts.  What have been your lowest and highest financial points?  I don’t think I’ve ever had a high financial point. I’ve always lived in extreme duress and poverty. I’ve lost everything and been homeless.   In my 50s, I had Hepatitis C, I had severe depression, and had just come out of homelessness. I had to start over. I had to have another spinal fusion and had to go through treatment of Hep C, which I got from my husband. Then I couldn’t get treated for Hep C until I got the spinal fusion, and I was really sick for a long time. I got knocked down again and again.  The Hep C treatment was very hard and lasted a year. It was hard to get back in to art after that. I didn’t know how to reach out for help. I had given up on myself, and that’s the heart of addiction.  In the first six months of my sobriety, I faced my father’s death, my husband’s death, and the beginning of my son’s first major health problems. My son was previously a serious heroin addict, but he was sober for five years. He was diagnosed with untreatable life-threatening bacteria related to the use of needles. Over the following year he had to have a heart transplant and he had congestive heart failure and kidney failure. We went through these experiences together and stayed sober. Deep inside me, the spiritual reality and love of God took me out of the darkness. Some people call addiction the Dark Night of the Soul.  The spiritual and physical lessons I learned from sobriety are cornerstones for me to live with a current diagnosis of focal point dysphoria, which is a brain related movement disorder. We never know how much time we have and together we can make our lives better. The SaverLife program is a glimpse of hope because it provides matching funds and resources. I hope my story can help someone else can find inspiration or confirmation. Living within our means is important as we see our neighbors who seem to have a better material life.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Not that I’ve always lived by this, but my favorite advice is “live within your means.” It’s a spiritual as well as financial quest for me. One of the best things you can do is buy your own land and pay it off.  I am trying to create a budget that’s truly realistic for my daily needs. It takes spiritual discipline because I can’t rely on old habits or impulses. I’m a Christian, and it’s about thanking God first instead of reacting on emotion. I am trying to focus on what I do have. I need to trust that there is another way without asking impulsively what it is.  What are your goals for the future?  My main goal is to do something of value to help someone else and be of service to other people. I’m a member of churches, a member and volunteer of Interfaith Counsel, and I volunteer as a Special Olympics swimming coach.  It’s less about what I want, and more about what others need from me, to be able to be there, be present, and lift others. All you really need to do is be present and listen.  I hope to volunteer with women while they are in prison or jail and after they get out. For me, transition is the most difficult aspect of change. Hopefully my experience may be helpful to them. After fourteen years of surgeries, being homeless, having no credit, work, or friends, I became aware of many resources within my community. I started actively participating with groups or programs that helped me. Now my hand is available to others trying to better their lives. I am not paid for this work, but it’s a full-time job.  I want to make sure I leave this life with my debts paid and my apartment cleaned out, hopefully my burial paid for, and some means for my family to get together to celebrate life.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It doesn’t. I’ve learned that you earn your way through life. Nothing is free. We’re expected to take the gifts we are given and do the work we can do. If I can’t make ends meet, having more money may not fix that.  I hope that if your readers can read this and learn about my experiences, they don’t need to go through some of the struggles that I’ve been through. "}

{"prompt":"Lisa’s Story: Working as a Waitress During the COVID-19 Pandemic","completion":" Meet Lisa, a waitress and DoorDasher who lives with her husband in Louisiana.  What’s it like working in-person right now?  I’m working two jobs at the moment. My main job is serving and waitressing at a local restaurant. I’d consider myself a frontline worker because I’m interacting with folks in person a couple of days a week. I also started doing DoorDash as a side hustle this year.  In all honesty, it’s been crazy. Some days, I don’t even know if I want to go into work because so many people are sick and the number of COVID-19 cases keep rising in our area. But at the end of the day, I have to do what I have to do to support my family and especially my two kids.   What do you like about being a waitress?  I’ve been working in the restaurant industry since I was 18. I have a lot of experience working in restaurants, but I’ve enjoyed being a waitress the most. I would definitely consider myself a people person, which would explain why I love waitressing. As for the pay, you pretty much know what you’re going to make, and most of the time my bills are paid. The pandemic really threw our finances off though.  Were you and your family impacted at the start of the shelter-in-place mandates in March?  When this all started, I lost my job due to COVID-19 shutting places down. My family and I used to live in Georgia but have to move to Louisiana for jobs. Within the first two months of the shutdown, so many places closed and we didn’t know when they would open back up again. The restaurant I worked at in Georgia shut down completely. Things took a turn when that happened. All of a sudden, the bills and rent were due and we didn’t have an income to pay them. On top of that, my landlord evicted us. This was before the eviction moratorium was in place, so we didn’t have protection. It was like everything came crashing down.   Luckily, I have family in Louisiana, so we moved. Louisiana had some restaurants open at limited capacity, so my husband (he’s a sushi chef) and I were able to find work pretty quickly. We’re both following all health and safety protocols at our workplace. During my off days, I deliver food with DoorDash. It’s been nice because I haven’t had to deal with as many people as I would have if I were waitressing that day. The pay comes faster as well, so that’s a nice bonus.   Are your kids in school? What does that look like for them?  They’re staying with their grandma in California. It sucks that I don’t get to see them, but I know that what we’re sacrificing now will have all been worth it in the long run. When COVID-19 hit, my husband’s mom offered to take care of our kids while we found work. She’s a seasoned live dealer at a casino and has paid leave, so it wasn’t a big issue for her to take care of them. There’s a daycare facility at the casino as well, but it’s pretty expensive.  Walk me through a day in your life.  My shift hours are the same as my husband’s. Right now, we’re working 10am to 10pm with a break from 2-4:30pm. We’ve been working together for about three years, and I like to joke that my day consists of being around my husband all hours of the day.  We drive to and from work, which takes 25 minutes each way. Oddly enough, the pandemic didn’t slow the traffic in the downtown area. If anything, it’s stayed pretty much the same. You’d expect people to be staying home like they’re supposed to, but they’re out and about regardless. When the mayor put a mask mandate in place, downtown got even more busy. It’s sad because those who don’t care don’t realize how serious COVID-19 is until it happens to one of them or a family member.   Would you consider yourself financially stable?  Even before the pandemic, it was hard for us to be financially stable. I just had my daughter in November of last year, so I was depending on my husband and the income he earned because I couldn’t work. Working has helped me become more knowledgeable about things like money management and credit. I wasn’t the best at saving money before, but I’m getting a lot better now.   What would you like to do when things are more normal?  I want to see my kids, be around family, and just enjoy being around people. Obviously, I also want to be able to show my face and not have a muffled conversation with folks when I’m working at the restaurant, too.  Are you saving for anything in particular at the moment?   At the start of the pandemic, we didn’t have a car. My mother-in-law’s sister went on a limb and sacrificed so much to get us a car so we could drive to work. She didn’t have to do that, but she did. She and her husband have a nice farm here in Louisiana, and they took me and my husband in. I’m so thankful for their hospitality and want to repay them somehow.   How do you envision your family’s future?  I want us to be in a good place financially, mentally, and physically. Once we overcome this pandemic, I want my kids to grow up and not have to worry about things like wearing a mask. Most of all, I want to get a house for my family and be a full-time mom.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  If I’m being honest, SaverLife literally saved my life. This past May, I was eligible for the  $500 Emergency Response Fund grant . I found SaverLife through the Steady app, and it wasn’t long after that I was scrolling through the  Money 101 articles . I read everything now, from the newsletters to the  Saver Stories . I even told my husband to make a SaverLife account!  "}
{"prompt":"Wolf’s Story: It’s Not About Amassing a Fortune","completion":" Meet Wolf, a retired psychologist living in the mountains of Colorado with his wife and many animals.  What do you do?  My wife and I are retired. We have a small, 35-acre ranch here. We make a little bit of extra money with our goats and chickens. I also contract tutor online. It’s a good way to make a little bit of extra income.  What ups and downs have you had financially?  Our financial struggles happened after we retired. We had everything set up and I do have a pension, but then several things happened. We had a massive windstorm with 150 mph winds. It blew out the windows in our car and home, and it destroyed our solar panels and windmills as well. The storm took our barns and threw them into the woods, too. We were well-insured, but that wasn’t enough to replace everything. Plus, this happened in November, and they couldn’t replace things until June.  Then I was diagnosed with leukemia. I had medical insurance, but it wasn’t nearly enough, and I didn’t qualify for Medicare yet. We had thousands of dollars of medical bills, which just wiped out our savings. And then my pension was cut!  All of that took us from a very good position to a very bad position—all in less than a year in 2011.  I haven’t been healthy enough to work, and my wife has been disabled for a number of years. People don’t realize that within a short period of time, you can be really destroyed financially.  Just this year, we started saving again. That’s eight years where we were just trying to fix all of this. I laugh when I hear advice like, “cut back on coffee and eating out.” We completely cut that out.  The bottom line is that medical insurance doesn’t cover enough. I had three visits to the ICU, and we know that we’re not alone. Many people have been through worse. We’re lucky that our house was paid off and that we have a roof over our heads.   What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My mother was the big financial whiz. She was a school teacher. My dad died when I was 11 years old, but even before that, my mom handled the finances. When she passed away, she left us enough so that we could get the ranch we have now.  She watched everything that she spent. She wasn’t a penny pincher, but she spent deliberately. The only year when she was extremely frugal was the year after my dad died.  As I got older, I started seeing the value in saving. She taught me the importance of having insurance for everything that’s valuable.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?   To set something aside in savings so that you can afford emergencies. Without that, it makes things very difficult. You’re stuck. Our generator recently went out, and we need that as a backup in the winter. We didn’t have savings, so we just had to wait.  I feel very strongly that it’s important to always have something to fall back on.  What’s one thing you know about money now that you wish you knew when you were younger?  That it’s a whole lot easier to save when you’re young than to try to catch up when you’re older. Start saving young, and keep it going.  What are your goals for the future?  Just to be able to build up our savings again. That’s really the main thing. We want to be able to live comfortably, but still afford any emergencies. And as we get older, we know we need that emergency fund more.  We have gotten to the point again where we’re able to do things. We still don’t eat out, but we’re able to eat out.  What does money mean to you in your life?  I don’t put a lot of emphasis on money, except what it takes to be comfortable. I’ve never allowed money to rule my life. It’s important to be able to live comfortably and to be able to take care of your family. It’s a utilitarian thing for me.  I’ve never been into amassing a fortune. And I never will be! "}
{"prompt":"Candice’s Story: Getting Back on Her Feet","completion":" Meet Candice, a Baltimore native who’s looking to get back on her feet after a recent car accident.  What do you do?  Currently, I’m unemployed unfortunately. It happened right after a car accident. Prior to that, I was a medical assistant for four or five years. It’s really been my passion. Now I’m looking to further my education and eventually become a nurse. I’ve been doing some research on accelerated programs, and I’m exploring the different types of nursing careers.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My mom was pretty frugal to say the least. She always taught me to keep certain food and toiletry staples stocked up. Oh, and keep $20 on me at all times just in case.  What are your lowest and highest financial points?  I haven’t really had a highest financial point mostly because when I get to a place where I’m stable, I end up losing close to everything. One example of this was my recent car accident. After the incident, I lost my money-making, full-time job as well as my part-time job. I’m pretty much homeless at this point. However, I can still get into the money saving mindset. When I do have money, I don’t blow it like some people might be tempted to.  When you don’t have a lot of money and all of a sudden start earning a paycheck, the want to spend recklessly is really high.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  I’d say it’s probably making sure all your bills are paid on time and that you have to keep up your good credit.  Don’t live beyond your means is a good one, too. For example, right now as I’m unemployed, it would be ridiculous to trade my car in or get multiple new credit cards. At this point, I just want to make sound financial decisions. I’m trying to be financially conscious, which is why I’m trying to save what I can right now.  What are your goals for the future?  I just want to be more financially stable and prepared. Additionally, it would be great to be financially independent and have multiple streams of income. One of my dreams is to open my own small business. I’ve heard from many people that it’s a lot more work to manage and whatnot, but I like that I can be independent. Right now, I’m just looking to build a foundation for all of it.  Tell me more about your independent business idea.  I’m interested in starting a fashion t-shirt and purse line. Running a business is something that I’d enjoy. Not everyone who has a regular 9-5 enjoys what they do day in and day out and I want to actually enjoy what I’m doing. I’ve had this dream of owning my own business since I worked at Rite Aid at the age of 17.  What’s one thing you’ve bought on sale this year that you’re happy with?  Definitely my car. I was saving up for one when I finally bought one in 2018. It was something I said I was going to do for a while, and I made it happen.  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money makes the world go around. Pretty much, if you don’t have it, you’re out of luck.  Here in Baltimore, the cost of living is constantly going up while the money for income is limited to a certain group of people with high education degrees.   There’s not much financial assistance for those who aren’t disabled or who fit into the typical government assistance programs for the elderly, retired, military veterans, etc. For the regular Joes and Janes that have fallen on hard times, there’s not much financial assistance—or financial education for that matter—to help them get back up and stay up.  How did you feel about winning $50 from the SaverLife Tax Time Pledge?  I was happy about it! I wasn’t expecting it at all! It was a good idea for SaverLife to have this competition.   I actually left the money in my PayPal. I’m saving it for a rainy day for sure. "}
{"prompt":"Garry’s Story: Make a Dollar, Keep a Dollar, Give a Dollar","completion":" Meet Garry, a recent Howard University graduate who runs a freelance photography and videography business in Washington, D.C.  Where’s home for you?  I’ve been living in Washington, D.C. since 2015, but I’m originally from North Carolina. I went to Howard University for film school, where my sister was already getting her Master’s in Film.  What’s your living situation?  I live with one other roommate. It has its ups and downs, especially when it comes to money. I’ve had to get used to depending on someone for rent money. My roommate has been a bit of a liability. Both our names are on the lease, but I’m the master lease holder. He’s about five months behind on his rent.  How are you dealing with his lag?  I’m just trying to keep the landlord happy and make sure my part is paid. I’m holding out hope that he gets a financial boost really soon.  Take me though a typical day in your life.  I’m working full-time for networks right now, and my call time for projects is usually 5am. But my schedule really depends on what network I’m working with, and everything is very dependent on the project. Usually, the days are long no matter what time I start. You have no idea what goes into just getting something on your screen!  I also have my own film and video business on the side. At first I was dependent on the different networks to get me work, but then I thought, “I could just get my own equipment.” Obviously, I don’t have the same caliber of equipment that they do in the studios, but I work with what I have. I’ve worked with different business, models, actresses, and helped film music videos. I’ve been running this for about three years now.  Where do you see your business in five years?  I really want to have more consistent clients. My dream is to have my own film company or streaming service.  What did your childhood teach you about finances?  My parents separated and I grew up with a single mom. Both my mom and dad took time to teach me about money and how hard it was to get money, especially my dad.  When my grandma was alive, she taught me the ins and outs of the flea market. She had her own booth, and when I came of age, I would help her out. I remember around Christmas, I would get all kinds of gifts for my birthday and Christmas because I’m a December baby. For things I didn’t play with anymore, my grandma helped me sell. That was my first taste of being a businessperson. She taught me how to make a dollar, keep a dollar, and how to give it away.  What’s been a time in your life that you’ve felt most financially secure?  Last year I was feeling really secure in terms of my business. I actually got so busy that I had to turn things down. Because it’s all freelance, I was able to do that. There’s really no cap to the amount that I can make, which is great because I can make as much money as I need.  As a recent grad, do you have any student debt?  I’m still within the grace period of loan repayment, but I’ll start paying it back at the end of this year. I’ve been preparing by putting money aside here and there. It’s definitely a big amount that I owe.  I don’t know how much longer the American public can keep this up. Someone needs to forgive the amount of student debt we have as a nation. People leave the world with thousands in debt.  What are your financial goals for the future?  I’m working on getting a house in the D.C. area. I have a three-year-old daughter, and I want her to stay with me whenever she wants to visit since I don’t live with her and her mom. Ideally, I’d like a two-bedroom row house or town house. Something that’s not above the $200k range. I’m hoping to run across a good deal!   What does money mean to you in your life?  Money is a tool to me. That’s about it. I wouldn’t care about it if I didn’t have to exchange it for goods and services. You have to have money to go about your day.  How did you feel about winning $50 from the SaverLife Tax Time Pledge?  It was great! It kind of came out of nowhere, but it was right on time. I’m thinking I could use it for gas. "}
{"prompt":"April’s Story: Wanting Better For Her Son","completion":" Meet April, a single mother who lives with her two-year-old son in Nevada.  How have the last couple of months been?  My son and I have been through a lot, but we’re still patient. I’m trying to do the best I can to provide for him. Things are tough right now because it’s the first time a pandemic has happened in most people’s lifetimes.  How are you taking care of yourself these days?  As much as possible, I stay focused on the positives. My son is two years old and I try to keep him really active so he doesn’t get bored. We try to limit the times we go out, so I’m always thinking of fun things we can do together at home. Family time consists of playing games, coloring books, and teaching sign language to my son. He’s a hearing person, but I’m deaf. I’ve been teaching my son sign language so we can communicate.   What does a day in your life currently look like?   During the day, we chat, play games, watch movies, and spend time together. Sometimes we go to the park because my son really likes to go outside, but it’s hard to find a park nearby that’s open. Actually, a lot of places are still closed. Grocery shopping is our main activity these days. Above all, the most important thing to me is keeping my son safe.  What’s your profession?  I’m not currently employed, but I’m looking for work. I have “momma duty work” right now.  In Las Vegas, there are thousands of people who’ve been laid off. Employment is hard to find around here, so I’m trying to find a job online. I’m not exactly sure what I’m looking for, but I’m actively looking for something to do from home.  Are you able to save these days?  To be honest, saving has been difficult because we’re a low-income family and don’t have a lot of money to begin with. I don’t come from a wealthy family either. I’m trying to save so I can make sure I have something saved up for me and my child.   Has COVID-19 impacted your financial situation?  Yes, it has. A lot of my life has changed dramatically. I’m starting to struggle to keep up with my bills and rent. I’m on a steady financial decline at this time. Right now, I’m looking for programs that could help me out with paying my bills.  Have you had any success in finding any of those kinds of programs?  Fortunately, yes. The  Salvation Army  was a great resource. I’ve also been able to find some Las Vegas-specific programs to help me out with the bills and rent. What I realized is that some of these programs are waiting for people to donate to the organization before they can help those in need.  Tell me how you envision your family’s future.  I want us to live and have a happy future. It would be nice to travel and visit countries like Ethiopia and France. I want to make my son happy as we explore new countries. I’ve never had that opportunity to travel, but I want my son to have those experiences that I didn’t have growing up.  I was raised in foster homes and group homes growing up, so I didn’t have a stable household. I don’t want my son to experience dealing with Child Protective Services because it’s really depressing. He deserves a better environment than what I had.   Did you have a chance to learn about money growing up?  I learned a little bit about saving money during high school, but never had the chance to open a savings account. I didn’t work in high school or have money, and I wish I had some family members who could have taught me about managing my finances.  With my son, I want to teach him about things like budgeting and saving. My hope is that he’ll learn how to manage his money wisely and not spend it all. When he gets older, I’ll teach him about the importance of having an emergency fund set aside.  What does “financial wellness” mean to you?  To me, it means achieving my money goals. My first goal is to start saving $50,000 to get a car. After that, I want to save $50,000 for my son. I want to set him up with an emergency fund.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  It’s AHHH-mazing. I love it. I’ve learned so much from the organization already. With SaverLife’s free financial coaching program, I’ve been able to learn about topics like  debt management ,  saving versus spending , and  budgeting .  "}
{"prompt":"Meet Jonquille, a $1,000 Winner!","completion":" Jonquille lives in Florissant, Missouri with her two sons and works as a billing supervisor. Earlier this year, she pledged to save her 2018 tax refund with SaverLife, then submitted her story about what motivates her to save. We called Jonquille to surprise her with the news that she won $1,000. Check out her reaction!     What did you learn about money as a kid?  I really didn’t. My dad was a postal worker; he carried the mail. My mother was a pediatric nurse practitioner. They didn’t talk much about money. It wasn’t until I got to college and got a credit card when they sat me down to have the talk. But it still didn’t really resonate with me.  Even now, I struggle at times with money. I’ve gotten to the point where I realize that a lot of my money goes to bills. And I don’t like that! I work too hard for my money and I want to travel. I don’t want to be paying credit card bills all the time.  My grandmother said, “Always save for a rainy day.” Back then, they didn’t have credit cards. They just had to save up their money to pay for things. Now it’s all about “swipe, swipe, swipe.” I don’t like that anymore.  We get into this mindset where, if there’s an emergency, we run for our credit card. But now you’re stuck paying for that. If I had saved that money ahead of time, I wouldn’t be stuck paying interest. Because I always know that an emergency will eventually happen. The car is going to break down or some appliance is going to break. It’s not if, it’s when.  Even with my two boys, they have savings accounts now. They know that if they get money for their birthday or for Christmas, they have to put some of that money away.  Have you had ups and downs with money in your life?  Oh yeah. One down was when I had a job change and my pay was cut. I hated being at a point in my life where I was late on bills. Even though I’m a collector, I don’t want to get collections!  This year, it was great to be able to save my tax refund. I didn’t really need it for anything immediately, and I was able to put it away. And that’s something I want to be able to do going forward. When the tax refund comes, your first thought is always, “What am I going to spend it on?” But I’d like to be able to take that commitment that I made this year and save every year going forward.  What does money mean to you?  It means bills! It felt for a long time like all my money was going to bills, and it shouldn’t be that way. I’m getting older now, and I’m in my 40s. I don’t feel like I’m old, but I want to be able to travel. I love to travel.  Growing up, I was an only child, so my parents took me on vacation every year. I haven’t had a chance to do that with my boys. I took them to LA a couple years ago for a week. We went to Venice Beach and Six Flags, and we had a great time. My boys would love to go to New York.

{"prompt":"Week 5 Credit Quiz Results","completion":" Here are the results from our fifth—and last—holiday savings quiz! Scroll through to see what members answered and  take the quiz yourself .  1. I review my credit report at least once a year.   A  study by the Federal Trade Commission  reveals that 1 in 5 people have an error on their credit report. Review your credit report annually, so you do not financially pay for someone else’s mistakes.  2. I pay my bills on time.   On-time payments are one of the most significant factors that impact your credit score. Even being a few days late can raise your interest rate and incur late fees.  3. I know my credit card interest rates and due dates.   Consider contacting your creditor and asking them to lower your interest rate. Some creditors may move your due date, and if you are late, your interest rates can go up, then your creditor may apply late fees to your account.  4. I know how to increase my credit score.   The easiest way to increase your credit score is to make on-time payments. On-time payments account for about 35% of your credit score. Consider setting reminders in your online calendar to pay or set up automatic payments.  5. I am happy with my credit score.   If you aren’t happy with your credit score, you can take several steps to improve it. This involves making on-time payments and limiting how many times you apply for credit. If your low credit score is due to errors,  dispute the errors  to the all three credit bureaus:  TransUnion ,  Equifax , and  Experian .   6. If you miss a payment, how long will the missed payment be on your credit report?   I know you probably feel we are repeating ourselves, but we cannot overstate how damaging even one late payment can be to your credit report. It  stays on your credit report for years  and can impact your ability to get auto loans, a mortgage, and other credit.   7. What are the 5 factors that make up your credit score?   If you are trying to increase your credit score, there are steps you can take without having to hire a credit repair company, but it takes time. Increase your credit score by paying your debts on time, limiting how many times you apply for credit, and only using about 30% of your overall credit limit.  8. How can a low credit score hurt you?   A low credit score can impact your ability to rent or buy a home, get a car loan, or even cell phone service. A low credit score can also cost you money. You may pay more for a mortgage, have a higher-interest car loan, and pay more to turn on utilities.  9. What are the ways you can increase your credit score?   Improving your credit score starts with behavior. It’s paying your bills on time and limiting applications for credit. If you are trying to build credit, consider reporting rent payments to credit bureaus using third party reporting agencies like  PayYourRent.com  or  Renttrack.com  or your utility bills through  Experian  or  TransUnion .  10. Annualcreditreport.com is the only authorized source for the free report that’s yours by law.   Aside from Annualcreditreport.com, some credit card companies and credit monitoring companies may provide free credit reports. Remember to get reports from all three creditors: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Credit bureaus report your credit differently. Once you have your credit reports, consider using a  checklist like Nolo’s  to review your credit check. "}
{"prompt":"David’s Story: Three Members of One Family Survive the Virus","completion":" There are over 110,00 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the city of New York, in every borough. David, his father, and his stepmother are three of them.   David and his family, all highly involved members of their Bronx neighborhood, were hit with the virus weeks ago and are only now beginning to recover–but their lives are still upended by COVID-19. David, a freelance videographer, lost his income when the crisis hit and was unable to buy the essentials he needed to heal, like groceries and medicine. His main client, the Legal Aid Foundation, hasn’t had much work for him since the courts are shut down. David’s stepmother runs a service agency for the disabled, and several of her staff members are unable to work due to illness.   David’s father and stepbrother are both pastors, and with no usual Sunday services, the churches they run have not received their usual donations from members. David and his father were able to secure extensions on certain payments, like insurance and utilities. However, the family remains concerned that they may lose their housing, the parsonage of David’s father’s church. “This is a community of working poor. People are living check-to-check. We’re all out of work, so people can’t give. It’s all up in the air about whether we can continue maintaining the property.”     David has tried to file for unemployment–newly expanded for independent contractors like him during the coronavirus crisis–but there is such high demand that he hasn’t been able to get through. “I applied and spent the next two weeks trying to get through to the phone lines. I have been unsuccessfully trying to finish my application.”   Because there are so many applicants for unemployment, rather than leaving callers on hold, the unemployment office is actually automatically ending calls due to overload. When the unemployment office did finally call back, David wasn’t at his phone and missed the call, leaving him with no recourse but to try again with the same automated system.   On top of the mounting stressors of daily life without income, David is concerned his father may need longer-term, and expensive, medical care. David’s father, who is in his mid-seventies, experienced neurological complications from COVID-19, including two seizures.   David and his family need support to survive the crisis, which could leave them with little to no income for months. With the help of our partners Humanity Forward and Neighborhood Trust, SaverLife was able to disburse a $1,000 payment to David to help him care for himself and his family. David used some of it to cover his groceries and pay his cell phone bill, and he donated half to his stepbrother’s church. “I wasn’t expecting to receive this money, so it felt important to me to share it and distribute it to the community. I am so thankful because, without this, I would be at $0 in my bank account right now,” said David. Now, David has a few hundred dollars to help him cover his basic needs, and so does his stepbrother.   Surviving a serious illness–especially one that hits multiple people in one family–is exhausting and even terrifying. It shouldn’t be financially crippling too. Until David and his family are back on their feet, SaverLife, Humanity Forward and Neighborhood Trust worked together to help David and his community. "}
{"prompt":"Rashala’s Story: Saving Money For Her Daughter","completion":" Meet Rashala, a Youth Development Coordinator for the Boys and Girls Club for America who lives with her daughter in Tennessee.   Tell me about your job.   During the pandemic, we’ve been focusing more on virtual learning. For my role, we’re that means helping the kids out with their school work and teaching them life skills. We recently taught the kids etiquette and how to be kind to people of different backgrounds, religions, and ethnicities.   What does a day in your life currently look like?   I wake up at 6:30 am, make coffee, get my daughter dressed, drop her off at school, then I go to work. After she’s done with school, I pick her up, we eat dinner together, relax, then go to bed and get ready to repeat the process the next day.   When I have time to unwind, I usually read a few blog posts from people I follow, journal a bit, and watch tv.  What did you learn about money growing up?   While I learned a lot about saving money, I wish I could’ve learned about credit, investing, and student loans at an early age.   Also, even though I came from a single-parent household, I never went hungry. And I knew it was a struggle sometimes.    Do you have student loans? What does the payment process look like right now?  The student loan moratorium has really helped. Because I don’t need to pay my federal student loans at the moment, I’ve been able to establish a savings account for my daughter. I’ve also been able to save a couple of months’ worth of income in my emergency fund.   Did you receive both stimulus checks from 2020? What did you do with them?  Yes, I received both. I saved a lot of the first one, and the second one came at a time when I needed to use it for bills.   What does saving look like right now for you?   Saving has been really hard during the pandemic. My hours at work have been tremendously reduced, so I’m making less. I don’t have a lot left over in my paycheck after I pay my bills. But in terms of saving, just knowing that I have a bit of savings has been helpful. It’s what’s been keeping me afloat since my hours were reduced.   How has the pandemic affected your life?  Because the Boys and Girls Club for America has been servicing essential workers’ children, this job has brought me most of my income. On the downside, sometimes we’re shut down due to a COVID-19 exposure. And when I’m at work, I have childcare on my mind. I live in the city by myself and don’t have family around, so I’ve had to rely on childcare facilities and programs for my daughter. I get some financial assistance from the state, but I still have to pay a small portion of the cost of childcare.   Are you saving for anything in particular?   Right now, I’m just trying to save money for my daughter’s future. I want her to be financially prepared for the future—whether that’s college or whatever she decides to do.   Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather the pandemic?   Yes, we’ve had to do that especially since I might be out of work for two weeks at a time. It’s been a blessing to have any savings at all, but when you need to use that money, the tough part is restarting that savings process again.   Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.   Paying off debt increased my credit score. Now when I’m able to pay off more debt than I owe that month, that gives me a chance to only pay the minimum amount next month. "}
{"prompt":"Pashen’s Story: Lessons for My Boys","completion":" Meet Pashen, a Florida native currently living in Lake Wales with her three sons.  What do you do?  I’m a paraeducator at my local school district. I help my students who may have learning disabilities.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  As a kid, I was always worried if my parents were going to be able to pay the bills. It seems like there was never enough money. We’d get these conversations around Christmas about how they couldn’t buy us stuff, but they’d still always try to get us something.   What are your lowest and highest financial points?  Lowest would be when I wasn’t working and had to depend on my three boys’ dad.  My highest was being able to support myself and my three boys on just my income.  Are there any financial hardships you’ve recently overcome?  Trying to make ends meet while living paycheck to paycheck. It seems like with every paycheck, I’m trying not to get a loan or cash advance. I’m trying to see what I can pay, what I can’t pay, what I have to hold off paying.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  To save money and to keep up with my credit score.   What would you tell your 18-year-old self about money?  I would tell myself to save and I’d hope to save every penny.    What are your goals for the future?  Hopefully, making more money and be able to afford a house. We’re currently renting.  What does money mean to you in your life?  To me, it means stability. Money means being able to pay the bills and not worry about things. I want to be able to treat myself or the kids.  What do you hope for your boys’ future?  I’m currently talking to them now about saving and credit. As they go off to college, I want them to understand that no matter how much money they have, they should always save. I want them to have a savings plan for the future. "}
{"prompt":"Janna’s Story: Freedom to Travel","completion":" Meet Janna, a licensed social worker who lives in Texas and loves to travel.  What do you do?  I work for 2-1-1 Texas/UnitedWay HELPLINE, doing outreach and education about 2-1-1 services. I love my work. Every day is different, and there are different topics and coalitions that the community focuses on.  I actually heard about SaverLife through work. It coincided with a time that I really wanted to focus on saving.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I had a very blessed upbringing. We took family vacations. Each summer, we went camping and took an additional vacation.  I grew up with a lot of opportunities, and my parents always made a way to pay for what we were interested in. My brother and I were in sports, and my parents were middle income. But they always found a way to pay for our interests. We did chores and we didn’t have an allowance, but for a special occasion, we could go out to dinner at a pizza place and we could each get a toy at Kmart.  We weren’t indulged, but it was comfortable.   But then my parents divorced when I was in college, and that changed the financial situation a lot. My mom had more of a struggle. I ended up having to take out loans for college because my dad wasn’t willing to pay.  That was a huge shock to have to learn how to make ends meet in college.  My mom dropped me off for college and said, “God may not always give you what you want, but he’ll always give you what you need, and you’re about to learn the difference.”  What have been your highest and lowest financial points?  My lowest financial point was living in an apartment with two other roommates. One roommate and I went to collect aluminum cans because a cold front had come through our college town, and we wanted to buy hot chocolate.  The highest point has been the past couple of years. My salary is higher, and I’m able to redefine what is a “need” and a “want.”  This past year, I’m trying to reset my focus with SaverLife to make sure any extra money goes into savings. A lot of that is the reminders I get from SaverLife.  I really love to travel, and I’d rather this money go toward my savings so that I can travel to places I want to go. For my upcoming 50th birthday, I want to go on a trip – and I want to have all the money saved up before I go so that I don’t come home to debt.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  One that’s so simple is “pay yourself first.” Pay yourself first, put money in your savings, and if your company offers a 401k match, take full advantage of that. That’s free money that you could be leaving on the table. My company matches a good amount of what you put in.  When I was 25 and 26 working at the hospital, I wish I had invested then. It’s never too late to invest and save, but now I am focused on retirement. I don’t want to rely on social security benefits. I work in the community, so I see that a lot of people live on social security, and they have to decide between food and meds.  They say you need a million dollars to retire, and that may not be realistic, but I want to get as close as I can.  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money is financial freedom. I’m able to go do things, go on vacation, weekend retreats, when other friends of mine may not be able to.  I am single, and that is an advantage. Some of my friends with spouses or children struggle more than I do.  What are your goals for the future?  I want to pay off some debt and live debt-free again. I want to focus on savings and having a six-month emergency fund. "}

{"prompt":"Shari’s Story: A Mother and Writer Taking Control of Her Family’s Financial Future","completion":" Meet Shari, a mother in southern California using SaverLife to help her pay down debt while launching her freelance career.   Shari graduated from USC, had a daughter, and launched her career in the midst of the pandemic.   “I never knew childbirth was so expensive,” she said. “It’s almost a year later, and I’m still getting hospital bills from when she was born.”  Shari struggled to find work and childcare as a new mom, eventually realizing she would need a way to earn income from home while caring for her child.   A year later, Shari is working as a freelance writer and was an intern in Snapchat’s Storytelling Program. Her husband is working part-time while in graduate school.   Growing up in foster care, Shari didn’t learn about finance or budgeting.   “I struggled with budgeting all my life,” she said. “SaverLife has been important to help me change that.”  Coming out of school with a baby and student loans, she didn’t think saving was possible.   “I thought, ‘How will I save? I don’t have money!’ But SaverLife inspired me to see the importance of saving. That transformation in my mind of why it was important was really helpful.”   SaverLife also taught Shari how to set up automatic transfers from checking to savings and helped her learn to manage the emotional aspect of spending.   “I’ve learned to plan ahead and be mindful of my spending,” she explained. The ability to win cash prizes and points helped motivate her to keep up a savings habit. “I really like earning points by reading the articles. I like being able to earn while I learn.”  In July 2021, Shari’s family began receiving Child Tax Credit payments, a consistent source of income that helped her plan her family’s finances.   “It helped to be able to plan ahead and budget beforehand,” she said. Her goal is to save $100 a month and use the rest to pay off hospital bills and credit cards.   Shari is  pursuing a career as a freelance writer  and dreams of a strong financial future for her family.   “I envision not having to live paycheck to paycheck, to be able to have an emergency fund and enough money to buy things outside of the necessities,” she said.

{"prompt":"Revisiting Our $5,000 Grand Prize Winner, One Year Later","completion":" Derkisha is a SaverLife member, a nursing school student, and a mother of five.  Last year she pledged to save her tax refund with SaverLife and  won our $5,000 grand prize . We followed up with her to see how her life has changed in the past year.  What’ve you been up to this past year? How’s school?  I’m still at the same house in Texas. I’ve been in school full-time since I won the $5,000 award from SaverLife. After I finish my current six classes, I’ll only have four more left until I graduate. Last semester, I was really proud of myself for getting all As.  We’ll see how this semester goes because I’m taking a Chemistry course. I take both online as well as on-campus classes. I’m excited for the future, but really just excited to get through the next two months that’d be great. When I graduate with my transferable Associate’s degree this summer, I’ll start nursing classes at Texas A&M in the fall. I’m anticipating graduation in June 2022 from my nursing school.  What are you doing when you’re not in school?  In addition to going to school full-time, I work as a housekeeper part-time Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. I do a lot of planning so I’m able to keep track of everything I need to do and get things done. My older kids are all independent and help me around the house with chores. I like being busy.  Also, I’ve been thinking about opening my own business called Teacher’s Helping Hand. I want to focus on single mothers and parents who don’t have time to clean their houses so that they can have time to themselves to relax. I want to get that off the ground.  How are you feeling financially these days?  Financially, we’re good. I haven’t spent that $5,000 award because I still have plans and goals for that. Once I graduate, I really want a house built or at least buy land so I can build my house on it one day. I’ve been in contact with Habitat for Humanity (H4H) in Austin, and they told me the price I have to meet. If I have the opportunity to work with H4H, that’d be great.  I’ve been able to hold onto my savings, and I like the fact that I’m able to take care of my needs without taking out a loan. For example, I was having mechanical issues with my vehicle, and I was grateful to have that cushion to help me.  My siblings and I weren’t taught how to save, and so I’ve had to learn as an adult. I feel a lot more stable and less worried. Being a little more financially stable, it relieves a lot of tension as a single mother going to school full-time and working part-time. I recall not having savings and I was always stressed.  What does your budget look like?  I mainly spend my money on gas, my phone bill, and essentials that we need. Gas is my biggest expense right now. I don’t have to spend a lot because I’m in this transitional housing program. I also eliminated a whole lot of bills before I got here.  I’m working with a group of ladies, and we’re in a class learning the Dave Ramsey curriculum. This’ll help me keep track of budgeting so when I move out, I’ll have the knowledge and tools to have a real budget.   What are your kids up to these days?  My eldest wants to be a veterinarian, and she wants to have pets like a horse, dog, bunny, hamster, and ferret. That’s another reason why we want a big plot of land. My son wants to be a soldier and a policeman. My daughter wants to be a surgeon. We’ve been watching the show The Good Doctor, so that inspired her I think. And the youngest one loves following her sister’s footsteps when it comes to dancing. I’m so blessed to have opportunities like family dance nights with my kids.  I’m not pressing college onto them. If they want to make a business, I’ll support them. I’m not gonna kick them out when they’re 18. I want them to be financially stable first, which is something I didn’t have when I was growing up. I want to help set them up for success.   My sister is my neighbor, so I’m lucky to have that support from her. That’s why I’m able to do what I do. I think a lot of people are missing support when they’re stressed or depressed. I’ve been there before. All the little stuff takes time and energy. "}
{"prompt":"Women Run the (Financial) World","completion":" Financial Tips for Women  Beyoncé had it right. Girls run the world; she just left out the word “financial.”  With Women’s History Month coming to an end, I could think of nothing better than to create a piece for women by a woman. Why would I want to do this?  Women have been paving the way for future generations of women. More than ever before, women are the primary earners or sole earners for their households. Women make most of the spending decisions in their household. Personally, I think this fact alone puts women in a very powerful position. Financial security is the primary goal of money management for women. Although this is also true for men, women place a significantly higher emphasis on that goal.  If you’re wondering how I can take these few things and equate that to women running the financial world, think about it like this. Women are bringing in more income. They are in charge of deciding how to best use the money they or their partners are earning. The decision of whether to spend, save, or invest is falling into the hands of women. Money spent in their community is helping local businesses, and women tend to be more intentional in the businesses they support (woman- or black-owned businesses, for example). Women are doing all of this while keeping the focus on financial security for themselves and their families.  We have power. What can we do with it?  1. Set goals  Think about what financial security means to you. Clearly defining this will bring you clarity so you know exactly what you’re aiming for. The more you can break down this large goal into smaller chunks, the easier it will be to achieve. I think of it as a set of stairs. Nobody levitates up the stairs; we must take it one step at a time. For example, SaverLife member  Gloria  identified having her own place, being in a job for more than a year, and having an emergency fund as financial stability; she was able to pinpoint three separate goals she can start working toward.  2. Budget, track, and monitor  Before spending any of your money, create a  budget . Consider what expenses you must cover and prioritize other spending. Create a plan that will help you easily track your spending, such as using cash for certain expenses. This will help you stay within the budget you set. Monitor your budget to figure out what does and does not work for you on a regular basis. Then revise your plan as needed.  3. Save  Begin saving toward the financial security goals you have identified. Although it may be easy to dismiss saving for emergencies while working toward other financial goals, having an emergency fund is a proven strategy for success. An emergency fund ensures that when an unexpected expense occurs, you have money to overcome the situation. It keeps you from taking away from your other financial goals to deal with the emergency. You never backtrack in your goals when you think of them that way. If you need some inspiration,  Deirdre  explains how she built a $5,000 emergency fund.  4. Negotiate  Women tend to be accepting and appreciative of whatever salary is offered by a prospective employer and are also less likely to ask for a raise. Before simply accepting the pay and terms an employer brings to you, consider whether you should  negotiate your pay . Increasing the amount you bring home could make a big difference in how quickly you achieve financial security, how you prioritize spending, and how quickly you build your emergency fund.

What is one step you are willing to take to harness your power? Write down your answer and put it in your wallet to remind you of your commitment.

{"prompt":"Here’s How You Can Block an Eviction","completion":" In response to housing insecurity potentially leading to an increase in COVID-19 cases, the CDC issued a nationwide temporary halt in evictions through  June 30, 2021 .   In mid-September 2020, we asked over 500 members if they thought enough was being done to protect people from eviction or foreclosure. We found a large difference between the two groups of renters and homeowners. While homeowners were less worried about foreclosure, renters were 158% more likely to say that they’re concerned about being evicted.  If you or someone you know may be facing eviction, here’s what to do:  Talk to a legal expert regarding this form. The CDC’s eviction moratorium works differently from state to state. But luckily the  American Bar Association  and  Legal Services Corporation  can put you in touch with legal aid near you. Fill out this  CDC declaration , which certifies that you meet the eligibility requirement. Give that form to your landlord and stay in touch with your legal expert. In the meantime, communicate with your landlord. Be upfront about what you can afford to pay while you await the results.  Note :  Be mindful that you are still responsible for paying the rent that you owe at some point. And remember that the eviction moratorium only lasts until June 30, 2021 .  As this  NPR article  points out, “‘The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a historic threat to the nation’s public health,’ says CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. ‘Keeping people in their homes and out of crowded or congregate settings — like homeless shelters — by preventing evictions is a key step in helping to stop the spread of COVID-19.'” "}

{"prompt":"Nicholas’s Story: Learning the Ways of the Stock Market","completion":" Meet Nicholas, an Amazon delivery person who lives in New York City.  How do you like New York?  I’ve lived in New York City all 22 years of my life. There are so many jobs and public transportation runs 24/7. Though lately, the transit system has been running 20 hours a day instead of all day. It’s not a popular opinion around here, but I think people are better off getting their own vehicle because public transportation always has delays.  What’s your profession?  Right now, I’m doing deliveries for Amazon and I’ve been doing so for the last three years. This has always been a weekend type of thing, and it’s always come in handy during times like this. I had another job in the past, but I was laid off due to COVID.   I also do focus groups and surveys online during the week whenever possible. The little extra income is nice.  Walk me through a day in your life.  Recently, I got into following the stock market. I already live on the East Coast, so it’s easy for me to wake up before 9am and look at the daily news and how it influences the market. From 9am to 4pm, I stare at the screen and the market going up and down. Of course, I shower and brush my teeth in between.  On the weekends, I go to my Amazon delivery job, come home, rest, and prepare myself for the next day.   Tell me more about your experience with watching the stock market.  It was good until today. I watch the numbers go up and down throughout the day. I’ve been day trading, and I discovered that it’s a lot more expensive than just investing. I learned that I’ll have to save more money for taxes next year. Right now, I’m learning about tax deductions and what I may qualify for.   Day trading is just a lot more riskier than normal “set it and forget it” investing. One day you could make thousands of dollars, and the next day you could be back at square one. I saw the gains people were making and thought, “Maybe I should give it a try.”  How are you and your family coping with what’s going on?  We’ve been collecting unemployment and saving as much as we can with the funds that the state offers.  What was it like filing for unemployment?  Compared to my parents, filing for unemployment was easier for me because I had W-2s through my job. My parents are both self-employed, so the process was more difficult for them. The government asked for documents they didn’t have.  Other than that, I claimed late and it made me regret not filing for unemployment earlier. I was supposed to get my shift job back in June, but then I got laid off, so I didn’t start collecting until after I was officially laid off.  I didn’t know that you could still work while collecting unemployment insurance. So, right now, I can work and also receive unemployment insurance, but I get a reduction on the amount of funds I’d receive.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  Yes, I have. I had to dip into my savings before I filed my unemployment claim and started receiving unemployment insurance.   What’s your proudest financial achievement?  I’m starting to manage my money better nowadays. I used to have issues with spending.   Since the pandemic started, I’ve been making more money online doing surveys and participating in focus groups. In fact, I now make more in supplemental income online than I do from my regular weekend job. The additional money I’ve earned has been helping me save more and invest. I don’t know what jobs there might be in the future, and it’s nice to have some savings on the side.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It means financial freedom. To me, money is happiness. I can achieve happiness when I put my money to good use.  I had student loans, and I was able to pay it off using the unemployment insurance I received. I didn’t have to stress about that debt anymore.   How do you feel about SaverLife?  It’s a great website that gives you many financial topics to look at. The site definitely helped me save money, and it’s how I discovered investing. I like the $5 you could win with Scratch & Save.  "}

{"prompt":"Greg’s Story: A Veteran Planning for the Future","completion":" Greg is a veteran who lives in Danville, NY and works for the New York Army National Guard. He was selected as one of our 2020 Super Saver of the Year finalists. However, when he was growing up, savings was not a topic of conversation.   “I grew up in a poor family,” Greg said. “There was barely money to live off of. Every time I got money, I spent it.”  As an adult, Greg developed addictions to gambling and drinking. He accrued more than $20,000 in debt and was living paycheck to paycheck. Getting divorced was a wake-up call.   “One day I said, ‘I can’t do this anymore,’” Greg said. “I hit rock bottom.”  Greg stopped gambling and tried to curb his impulse spending. He saw an ad for SaverLife on Penny Hoarder and decided to join a  savings challenge . Before taking the challenge, he’d barely had a savings account, but over the six months of the challenge, he slowly began to build his savings. Over the last six years, he’s continued to save and learn about personal finance.   “It’s still a struggle but I try really hard to save money,” he said.    Greg paid off most of his debt by selling things he owned. He enjoys reading the  member stories  on SaverLife’s website and participating in  Scratch & Save .   “SaverLife opened a new path to start a journey of saving money,” he said. “It’s evolved me into becoming a better person at saving money.”  Greg encourages the soldiers he works with at the New York National Guard to use SaverLife to help them build their own financial security.   In December 2020, Greg won $1,000 as part of SaverLife’s first annual Super Saver of the Year competition. He plans to put the money in savings. He hopes it will provide a cushion in case a financial emergency arises.   “I’m just going to sit on it for a while,” he said. “It’s relieving.”  "}
{"prompt":"6 Tips for Protecting Your Personal Information Online","completion":" It’s that special time of the year again – tax time! With the conveniences of the digital age, there are many useful online tools to help you file your taxes. However, there are also sites that will try to gain access to your Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  Here are some tips and practices to help you protect your information.   Make sure the website is secure  Most browsers will notify you that a website is not secure. The warning tells you that any data that you put into the website (including credit card information or passwords) could be captured by a 3rd party. Avoid entering any information on these websites that may compromise your PII! If you receive a link you can identify an insecure website by seeing if the URL starts with HTTP instead of HTTPS. The S at the end denotes the website is using a form of encryption.   A secured website will display a lock next to the URL in the address bar of your website.   Avoid phishing scams  Scammers are getting more creative in how they present emails and messages to imitate a legitimate organization. Always closely inspect the URL and sender address of any email that is requesting your PII. Instead of clicking links or attachments within an email, you should log directly into the official company website to determine if any action is needed.  Most reputable organizations will openly display their official support email. If you’re having trouble with your SaverLife account, for example, you can contact us at help@saverlife.org. If a URL is different from what the organization generally uses (for example Saverlife.xn instead of SaverLife.org), avoid clicking the link.   Reach out to  support  if you’re concerned about a suspicious email.   Create strong and unique passwords  One of the easiest ways for hackers to access your PII is through a phishing scam. This is where a scammer impersonates a company to get you to enter your username and password.  If one of your accounts is compromised, you can mitigate the amount of access they have to your information by having different passwords on your other accounts. A password generator such as LastPass or KeePass can help you generate complex and unique passwords for every website you use.  Set up multi-factor authentication  Multi-factor authentication makes it harder for hackers to compromise your accounts. If your account is compromised, multi-factor authentication can also notify you that someone is attempting to log into your account. Most two-factor authentication methods today use your phone as the secondary device. You will be alerted immediately whenever your accounts are accessed without your permission.  Never provide your full bank, credit card, or social security number to support  If you need to provide a form of identification to a support inquiry, you should only need to give the last 4 digits. Most teams will have access to the last 4 numbers of your account or identification number. Providing a full number is only inviting unnecessary risk!  Use anti-virus protection  Most anti-virus protection now offers services and features that detect malicious web activity on the websites you visit and notify you. Free options include AVG and Avast.

{"prompt":"Andrew’s Story: The Pursuit of a Minimalist Lifestyle","completion":" Meet Andrew, a recent newlywed living in Daly City, CA with his wife and their 13-year old son.  What do you do?  I work for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission in the Water Resources Department. I’ve been at this position for a little over three years, but I’ve been with the company for over eight years.   What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My dad was pretty good about finances. He was the one who taught me about saving, investing, and making savings a part of your paycheck. I learned a lot of good money habits from him. Now I’m all about living debt free.  Can you tell me more about your commitment to living debt free?  I was a bit of a consumerist in college. I got a credit card when I was a freshman, and I was racking up debt buying stupid things. When I was a junior, I had what seemed like a mountain of debt. Around 2006-2007, my roommate and I stumbled upon some articles on minimalism. It took a few years, but we finally both got out of debt. It helped with spending and keeping things under control and really figuring out what’s important in life.  What’s your advice for people looking to adopt a minimalist lifestyle?  For me, anytime I make a purchase – especially a big purchase – I ask myself if it’s going to improve my life. Make sure you have the money for what you buy and you’re not buying frivolous things. Know what you value in life. For me, that’s experiences over material things.   Living within your means is harder than it sounds. When you’re working and making money, you have lifestyle creep and you’re trying to keep up with Joneses. Once you adopt a lifestyle where you’re not spending a lot of money, it gets easier. Be intentional with your money and time. Everything is valuable commodity and you don’t want to waste anything needlessly.  What have been your lowest and highest financial points?  My lowest was definitely when I graduated because I had consumer and student loan debt. I had a job lined up after college, but the recession hit right after I graduated and things took a turn. Unemployment benefits helped me survive for a bit. The grace period for student loan payments was ending, and I knew that I owed somewhere between ten and fifteen thousand dollars.  I achieved my highest point probably a few years later when I paid off all of my debt. I could see my entire paycheck coming to me instead of paying all my debtors. I was able to max out my 457b and my Roth, and I had a fully funded emergency fund.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Honestly, it is just living beneath your means. It’s kind of cliché, but I don’t think many people do that. Realize that you can still live a good life while saving and investing. It’s all about balance. You don’t want to be saving so hard and you could die tomorrow. Finding that balance is crucial.  You’re saving and investing for your future but remember that money is just a tool that you need to live. Don’t penny pinch all the time and not enjoy what life has to offer.   What does money mean to you in your life?  I definitely think it’s a tool and not the end all be all. Money itself doesn’t make you happy, but it can help you feel more secure. If you don’t have money, you’re just constantly going to worry about it.  If you have an emergency fund, you can breathe a little easier. For instance, our son broke his collarbone a month before my wife and I got married. Just knowing we had money to pay out of pocket after insurance helped.  What are your savings goals?  So now that I’m married, I think getting on the same page about finances is important. We do have a little bit of debt now. My wife has a car note and our goal is to pay that off soon. We’d also like to beef up our emergency fund. "}

{"prompt":"Gloria’s Story: A Path Toward Financial Stability","completion":" Meet Gloria, an aspiring pharmacy technician who lives with her five children in Minnesota.  Tell me more about you and your family.   In my house, it’s me and my five kids. They range in age from five months to 12 years old. We’ve been living in Saint Louis Park since June of this year. Right now, my days consist of taking care of my kids and trying to keep us all safe from COVID. We don’t go out unless we really, really have to. We’ve been more isolated these days.  What does going back to school look like for your older children?  They’re doing distance learning this fall, but we’ll see if that changes. I’m okay with their school situation since it’s probably safer for them to stay at home. They had a taste of what distance learning would be like since their school made the transition to go virtual earlier in the spring. We’ll see how things go when they eventually go back to school on campus.  Any current aspirations?  I’d like to be more stable in life. To my family and me, “stable” means many things: having a place of our own, a job where I’ve worked more than a year, and some sort of emergency savings set up. I don’t want to waste any more money.  I haven’t been saving the money that I do receive. Instead, I’ve been spending it. It’s harder right now to save because I don’t have any income coming in.   Tell me about your dream job.  I want to be a nurse. My kids actually inspired me to pursue that dream. When they were sick, I liked helping them get well. I started going to school to be a pharmacy technician, but it got to be too much with taking care of the kids and going to school.  What are you most looking forward to when the pandemic is over?  First, I’d like to find another stable job and do that for awhile. Then, I want to start going to pharmacy technician school again part-time.   Do you have any short-term or long-term savings goals?  I’d like to save at least $100 or $200 a month to start. I’m not saving for anything in particular right now. It’d be nice to have some amount of money saved up at all.  Did you learn about money growing up?  I learned how to balance a checkbook, but that’s about it. Nowadays, I want to teach my kids the things that I didn’t learn about growing up such as budgeting. When they get their own jobs, I want them to learn good spending habits like only buying what you need instead of spending money on whatever they want.  What does budgeting look like for you?  There is no budgeting right now during this pandemic. Everything I had saved up, I’m spending on things I need for my kids.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I found out about it through an app I was using. It seems like a helpful tool! "}

{"prompt":"Jessica’s Story: SaverLife’s Grand Prize Winner of the Bluefield Story Contest","completion":"    Meet Jessica, a customer support representative who lives with her husband and two daughters in Virginia.  Jessica was the $5,000 Grand Prize Winner of the Bluefield Story Contest.  Even though the SaverLife team couldn’t meet her in person, we were grateful for the opportunity to congratulate her virtually. Normally, we go out to our winners and actually surprise them in person with a check, but we couldn’t do that given the travel advisories. So we did a Zoom call instead!   Where did you grow up?   I grew up in Honaker, Virginia. It’s a small town about an hour from Bluefield. We weren’t poor poor, but we were pretty poor. We didn’t really have a lot, but I had a good childhood—just didn’t have what other people had.  Can you talk about your financial upbringing?   I remember little things like yearbook day, where you take your yearbook in and get your classmates to sign it. I never got one because we couldn’t afford it. My senior pictures and class ring were also too expensive. I had to borrow a cap and gown to graduate. I also didn’t get a car on my 16th birthday. When I got older, I realized that I didn’t want my kids to ever have to miss out on any of that stuff. I’ve been working since I was old enough so I could give them a better life.  What do you and your husband do?   He works for JS Construction. They build houses and do roofs and things, and then he does work on the side. On his days off, he’ll go fix roofs.  And then I work at Alorica for Mint. I do chat support. If someone needs help with their account, I can help them with troubleshooting. I’ve been here probably six or seven months. I’m blessed to be able to work still with the COVID-19 lockdown going on. I worked at a call center previously and then when one opened in Bluefield, I was really excited. So far, it’s been great! The teamwork is amazing. I love it.  How is the working from home going for you with your family there?   It was hard at first because the kids wanted to play while I was working and I’d have to say, “No, you can’t be in my room during these hours.” But they like having me here at home even if I can’t be next to them.  What did you like about SaverLife?   I’ve never been one to save. I’ve wanted to, but I just never could save. Our HR representative sent a notification out about SaverLife and suggested we sign up for the program. I did, and it made saving so fun! I’ve never seen anything like that before. Usually, I dip into my savings, but I’ve actually left it alone.  There’s lots of tips on there. I’d read through on how to save, especially with COVID-19 going on. Then there’s the savings challenges like the Races to $100 that you guys have. You track it and actually see where you’re at as far as how much you saved. I really like it.  Have you been participating in Scratch & Save?   I just started because I have direct deposit set up, so I have $50 a week going into my savings account. My husband and I are both working now, and while we’re not rich by far, it just makes me feel better knowing that I have some money in there. I have something saved in case an emergency happens or anything can happen.  Plus, I wanna teach my girls about money, too. Ever since they were little, they’ve seen me work. They know that you have to work for what you want to get in life, and then you need to save because you never know what tomorrow might bring.  What was it like finding out on TV that you’d won $5,000?   I was shaking like a leaf on a tree, I’m telling you! When I was interviewed, the news person asked if I knew why I was there. I said, “I’m a finalist for this story contest.” Then she said, “Well, you’re not just a finalist.” My heart started beating and then she grabbed that check and turned it around. I started crying. It was amazing. That was the best day ever.  Honestly, I didn’t think I was a winner because I didn’t want to get my hopes up. I was thinking, “Maybe there are five finalists?” Nothing good like that ever happens to me, so I was really surprised.  What are you planning to do with the money that you won?   I’m going to put some of it back in our savings account to get a head start on saving now that I can. Then I’ll probably take the girls and get them some clothes and let them pick something out. Maybe go out to eat or something whenever restaurants open back up.  Also, the house we live in now was where my husband grew up, and we’re wanting to buy it back. We’re hopefully going to save and do that eventually. He has a lot of memories here.  What does winning mean to you?   I’m speechless. It means more than you guys will ever know. That is gonna help us so much. We work, but it’s hard to save when you have bills upon bills upon bills. This is gonna give us something to put in our savings account. I’m forever grateful to SaverLife.  Do you know how much you’ve saved since you’ve signed up for SaverLife?   I think I’ve saved about $179. I just started a month ago. Like I said, I just recently started doing direct deposit.  What did you learn about money as a kid?   Honestly, to cherish it. I didn’t have a lot of it growing up. It was always government assistance and whatnot. And I mean, there’s nothing wrong with that, but I was determined to be different, to make a different life.  I was in and out of group homes and foster homes most of my childhood. So, having a home and family is more important to me than any dollar amount could ever be.  It’s little stuff. Even if it’s something like school pictures or yearbooks, we make sure they get them just so they’ll have those memories. Our school is closed for the rest of the year, so the memories will definitely be treasured.  What does money mean to you in your life?   Family to me is more important. Don’t get me wrong, I like having money, but if you have it, save it. Like I said before, you don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.  When have you felt most financially comfortable?   Right now. Just knowing that my husband and I both work and we don’t have to depend on the government to help or anything like that. We are really self-sufficient and that means more to me than anything in this whole entire world. I’m not knocking government assistance because I grew up with it, but I wanted to be self-sufficient. I wanted to be able to take care of myself and my own.  Have you had ups and downs with money in your life?   Oh yeah, absolutely. Before, I could never save. The minute I got money, it was gone. I never valued it, I guess. And then I’ve always worked, but I didn’t save money. I would pay my bills and take care of my kids, but I didn’t save anything. The older I got, the more I realized that you have to. You have to think about the future. Not just for me, but for my kids.   What’s been a low point for you financially?   I was homeless at one point and living in a car with my two kids.  I ended up staying with a friend. And when my husband and I moved in together, we got ourselves a little apartment and were literally sleeping on wooden floors while our girls had a bed. We just had blankets on the wood floors—no furniture, nothing. All we had was the car, the kids’ beds, and clothes. From there, we started building a life, and I think we’ve done pretty good for ourselves considering.  It seems like it. How has your life changed since you started saving?   I’m not as anxious. I can just sit back and breathe a little. If something happened tomorrow, we would be okay for a little bit. It’s nice to know that it’s there if we need it.  What’s your favorite thing about SaverLife?   I’m a competitive person, so I’m like, “If this person can save $100, then I’m going to save $150,” and it ends up being good for me. It makes saving fun. That’s the biggest thing. I actually shared SaverLife on my Facebook. I’ve told everybody. I’m like, “Get on there, it’s fun.”  What are your hopes for your daughters?   That they see that even though life hasn’t always been easy, I tried, and I did it all for them. I wanna know that they’ll be okay and see what it’s like to work for things you need and want. And that you need to save and be a good person. I just want them to be okay.  I want them to look back and say, “When I was younger, my mom worked her rear end off. She did what she had to do to take care of us, and now we know how to work and save and make it.” As long as they’re proud of me, that’s all that matters.  How would you describe SaverLife to a friend?   Amazing and fun! You get a lot of information. In addition to the website being fun, you do actually get savings tips and stuff. Then you have the community of members on the forum. It’s not just throwing you out there and saying, “Figure it out.” It’s just really awesome. "}

I use a budget to manage my spending monthly.   A budget is your plan for how you will spend your money. A budget can also help you plan for how much money to save monthly to help you reach your savings goals. There are plenty of budgeting apps to help you budget. Read  What apps do you recommend to track your spending habits?  for suggestions on choosing a good budgeting tool that works for you.  2. Before I buy something, I carefully consider whether I can afford it.   We all have busy lives. A budget reminds us of upcoming expenses so we don’t overspend.   3. I feel like my spending is under control.   If you feel that your spending is out of control, consider creating a budget. A budget is far more than a set of numbers on a spreadsheet. A budget helps to give you boundaries to keep your spending under control. For instance, if you struggle with clothing, giving yourself a certain amount to spend on clothing gives you limits on your spending.  4. I know how to create a budget.   If you know how to create a budget, great! Every quarter, do a review to make sure that your budget truly accounts for your spending. If you struggle to create a budget, read  6 Steps To Creating the Perfect Budget . This article walks you through a step-by-step process for creating a budget.  5. It’s hard to stick to my budget when unexpected expenses arise.   If you are struggling to budget for unexpected expenses, review your budget to make sure you are accounting for all expenses, not just bills. Also make sure that your budget is realistic. If you have a family of 6, a $100 grocery budget may not be realistic. For more tips to help you stick to your budget, consider reading  5 Reasons Why You Can’t Stick to A Budget and How to Fix It .  6. What types of expenses should be in your budget?   A budget should cover more than you bills. It should account for all spending like school activity fees or holiday spending.  7. Why is it important to budget?   Budgeting helps you stay current with monthly expenses and plan for future expenses so you don’t go into financial shock over upcoming expenses.  8. What are some ways to help you save more money?   The best way to save money is whatever method keeps you consistent. If you’re worried about being disciplined enough to save, or busy, then consider doing automatic deductions from your paycheck or bank account. Train yourself to transfer to have a savings mindset by committing any extra money—whether it’s from cutting back on an expense or a tax return to savings.  Take the holiday quiz for yourself! "}
{"prompt":"Mercedes’s Story: Changing her Students’ Lives","completion":" Meet Mercedes, a high school special education teacher who lives in Bridgeport, CT.   Tell me about your profession.  Well, I originally didn’t plan to be a teacher. A few years back, I completed a year with AmeriCorps. I loved the opportunity to be that positive role model for students, which is what inspired me to go back to school and earn my certificate to teach English.  My boss said that I should look into getting a degree in Special Education, which is what I did. I love getting to be a special education teacher because it’s about empowering students and their families.   What does a day in your life look like?  I wake up, get dressed, have breakfast, go through my classes, check-in with my students, and then check in with teachers.  After school is done, I run a girls’ mentoring program. We’re actually talking about financial literacy next, so I’m excited to share SaverLife’s  Money 101 articles  with them.   How’d you get started with your school’s girls’ mentoring program?  I was voluntold to run it. The kids chose me to lead their group. It was originally only for upperclassmen, but now girls from all four grades are involved.   It’s about bringing the upperclassmen and lowerclassmen together to have important conversations with one another. For me, it’s all about giving back. I’m happy that they like the topics we talk about.   How has COVID-19 impacted your job?  After four years of teaching, this year was the hardest. My students really didn’t like online classes. It was hard for them to be on their own and not have someone monitor them. It’s also been really hard to teach from home because I couldn’t get the kids as motivated or engaged over video calls.  The pandemic took a toll on what education looked and felt like. I was able to realize how fulfilling it was to teach classes in person.  As the pandemic went on, some of my students would be “attending” my online class while they were at work, and some completely gave up. Actually, some students chose to be homeschooled until they could go back to school in person.   At the end of the day, I just wanted to make sure that I could help my kids and make sure they graduate.  Could you share more about how you use our articles in your classroom?  In our school’s consumer math class, there were a number of students who struggled to grasp some of those concepts. These students had projects about saving money, picking a career, and making a budget. It was like pulling teeth with some of these kids to get their projects done.  After my aunt introduced me to SaverLife, I started sharing the Money 101 articles in class and we’d read them together. Then, I could see things start to click for these kids.   SL helped me share real-life examples of financial situations that they’ll experience in life. The articles are full-proof. They’d end up talking to each other about money management afterward.  One thing I realized throughout this process is that we don’t talk about college planning until they’re a senior in high school. How do first-generation students understand long-term investments, choosing a career, taking on student loans, etc.?  I firmly believe that we should start having these conversations sooner. In Connecticut where I teach, we have the biggest achievement gap in the nation. I want to help my students be independent and learn how to manage their money.   Can you tell me about a time you struggled with your finances?  My first year of college was tough because I didn’t have a job and didn’t realize how expensive textbooks were. Also, if my friends wanted to go off campus, I didn’t have money for that.   The first semester was a pivotal moment in my life. After I got a job, I started an emergency fund. But it still felt like I was going through this cycle of attending class, going to my job, going out with friends, and then not having money left.  What do budget and saving look like?  In the beginning, both saving and budgeting were hard for me. Now, I create a budget spreadsheet every month. These days, my goal is to save at least 20% of each paycheck.   I look at my income from teaching and tutoring, and at the end of each week, I look through my purchases and see if there’s anything that I can return. Impulse purchases are my weakness.   I was actually reading this  article from SaverLife about making SMART goals . After reading the article, I literally made a goal for the income I make from teaching.  Are you paying student loans right now?  I’m not paying my student loans right now because I just graduated after earning my Master’s in Special Education last week. So I still have some time before the repayment process starts. I really believe teaching is an undervalued profession.  Who knows? Maybe Dr. Jill Biden will be able to help raise awareness that teachers need to be paid more.  Have you received a stimulus payment? Do you recall what you do with the money?  I was fortunate enough to have received all the stimulus payments. A lot of it went toward paying off my credit cards. Any excess money after that went to fixing my car as well as savings.  How did you find SaverLife?  My aunt is a preschool teacher and she stays very engaged with her students’ parents. SaverLife was one of the websites that she recommended to her parents, and she recently shared your website with me.  I like that I get  rewarded with points and badges  for reading the articles. It’s really helpful for me. I also like that you can read  other people’s stories .   Are you saving for anything in particular?  Well, I’d love to pay off my mortgage and just get a new car. I’m just saving for emergencies now.   Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  My biggest achievement was definitely paying for my used car in cash. "}

{"prompt":"Heather’s Story: Helping Her Community Deal With COVID-19","completion":" Meet Heather, a hospice nurse who lives with her husband and two girls in Colchester, Vermont.   Tell me about your job.   I’m a registered nurse (RN) at Bayada Hospice, where we support five counties in the state of Vermont. Right now, I have 12-18 clients of my own. While I’m thankful for a steady job and income, I’m working 50-70 hours a week. Last week was particularly hectic because both flu and COVID-19 are on the rise in our counties.   I’m supporting people in their homes as well as those living in nursing homes. Those in hospice don’t get to see their families, and it’s gotten even worse with COVID-19. In the beginning of the pandemic, I wasn’t even able to see my own family because I was dealing with COVID-19 patients.   What does a day in your life currently look like?   At 6:30am, I wake up the girls before feeding our two dogs and one cat. Then I help my oldest get ready for online school by making sure she has everything she needs before she starts her day. After I drop my youngest off at school, I head to work. Since I cover five counties, I can drive up to 200 miles a day. I arrive back home around the same time that my husband and two girls do, and sometimes I bring my work home with me. After dinner, we’ll usually watch a movie together to wind down.   “My side hustle is the same as my job. I work extra hours as a hospice nurse for Bayada Hospice if I need the extra money. There is always more work, especially in these times of trial. I get to bring joy and the gift of comfort to families at the end of their loved one’s life. Rewards abound and my cup of gratitude and peace to be able to do what I do and get paid for it is a blessing.”   Can you tell me more about your financial situation?  My husband was on layoff in December, and he was supposed to go back in March, but that’s when the company furloughed him until May. He went back to work in May, but now we’re looking at him potentially getting furloughed in December.  When I took on my current position, it was fantastic and we were finally getting back on our feet. A year and a half ago, I lost my job at a different hospice facility. My previous job decided to give me double hours (80 instead of 40) with half the pay. And in August of this year, we had to file for chapter 13 bankruptcy. We almost lost our house because of the pay cut I took last year. We’ll have fully paid off our debt in two and a half years, but it’s a struggle to pay that in addition to other bills. We’re pretty much relying on my husband’s paycheck at this point because my paycheck covers our bankruptcy. You can do everything right and then sometimes things just go wrong.   There’s a federal moratorium on student loans until December 31, 2020. How prepared do you feel to start paying them again in the new year?  I started out with $100,000 and I’ve been able to work my way down to $65,000. Most of my student loans fell under the moratorium, but I’m still paying toward my private student loans. Once the moratorium ends and I have to start paying my federal student loans again, I know my budget will be tight, but it’s something that needs to happen. Right now, I pay about $400 in student loans every month.   Since the moratorium was put in place, I’ve been putting the money I would have been using for my federal loans toward our mortgage.  What does this school year look like for your family?  There were two active COVID cases from one family at my daughter’s school and neither of them wants to go back in-person. My oldest suffers from anxiety and she had a two hour panic attack last week; she refused to go to school. She only goes to school in person two days a week, but even that’s tough. This morning, our youngest daughter woke up and told us she didn’t want to go to school.  It’s a constant battle. Online school is a nightmare and we have constant talks with the teachers and staff about assignments that are lost and not getting done. My husband and I don’t know what’s right anymore. The hybrid model isn’t working, limited in-person classes aren’t working, and obviously online schooling isn’t working. I know kids need in-person learning, but I also know that that’s the best way to potentially contract COVID-19 other than getting it from me since I work in healthcare.  I think the world is just so anxious right now. They just moved our school district up to full capacity for classes. The teachers are not being tested for COVID-19 because there’s no requirement for it. There’s just a lack of testing happening in the state of Vermont.  Do the holidays look different for you this year?  Typically, I get to see my family. My sister and her two girls (my nieces) live in red zones (out of state), so they won’t be able to come celebrate the holidays with us this year. I’ve seen very few family members over the past year. But if COVID-19 cases continue to rise like they have been, I don’t think we’ll be able to keep seeing each other. We may have to have “Zoom holidays” like we did in the spring. For Easter this year, we had to celebrate over FaceTime.   What would you like to do after this is all over?  We canceled three family vacations this year, so we want to make up for that time. This fall, we were supposed to go to a friend’s wedding in Connecticut, but we’re missing it because of travel restrictions and the fact that I’d have to quarantine for a month when we returned. We take a yearly trip to the Maine sea coast to Wells Beach, but we can’t go this year. Unfortunately, we had to cancel our trips to Las Vegas and Niagara Falls, too. It was going to be our first time seeing the waterfalls. And we try to make our way to Orlando every couple of years to see my father, but obviously we had to push that out, too. I feel like we just wasted an entire summer. My kids couldn’t go to the beach, out to restaurants, or see their friends.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I signed up for SaverLife a couple of years ago, and I’ve loved it ever since. In the past, I’ve won $50 from a contest, $5 from a  Scratch & Save card , and I recently received one of the $500  Emergency Response Fund  grants. The cash grant came just in time because we received the money right when my husband got the news that he’d be furloughed.  "}
{"prompt":"Laurynn’s Story: How to be a Blessing to Others","completion":" Laurynn is a non-profit founder and daycare owner who lives in Central Florida with her two daughters.  How do you like living in Florida?  I honestly love it. I’ve been here for about three years, and I don’t see myself living anywhere else. The heat took some getting used to, but I usually stay inside with the AC on anyway. It’s definitely home for my two daughters and me. Besides my daughters, I’m surrounded by the family that I’ve made here. I’ve created some serious bonds since moving here with my two girls and that’s another reason why Florida is home.  What do you do for a living?  So I have multiple professions, but my main source of income is from the daycare I own. I’m also the founder of a non-profit, a notary, and an author of two books. I’d definitely consider myself a busybody. I’ve learned you have to wear many hats to survive.  Tell me about your favorite hat to wear.  I have two: my non-profit and the daycare I run. I’m passionate about both, and they’re equally important to me.  With the non-profit, it’s small, but I feel like it’s my mission to help people. It started with a food pantry beside my mailbox. I felt called to bridge the gap of hunger in my neighborhood. I thought to myself, “This is helping someone put food on their table.”  The daycare allowed me to raise my own children, which is the main reason I started it in the first place. It makes me very happy.  Could you tell me about the two books you’ve written?  The first one I wrote when I was very young. I talk about my experiences as a child and finding my way in life. And the second book is a collection of poetry.  What does a day in your life currently look like? How is your family coping with what’s going on?  Busy, busy, busy. I wake up at the crack of dawn. As a single mom of two daughters who are four and three years old, I have to start my day early. For my daycare, I’m not only serving my children, but other people’s children as well. I teach the children I care for. I participate in virtual prayer with my church at 7am. From the time my feet touch the floor when I wake up, I’m serving others, I’m planning, working on projects and developing things within myself.  I’m always busy with something. There’s never a day where I’m not exhausted by 12pm. Sometimes, I even feel guilt trying to sneak a nap in. I can get so caught up in helping others that I forget to do things for myself, like eat. I’m a very passionate person. Anything that I’m involved in, I’m giving it my everything.  In your  June Journaling  post, you mentioned helping others. What does that look like for you right now?   Each month, I put aside 10% for tithes for my church and $50 for charitable giving such as giving money to homeless people. I’ve made some changes because everyone I know, or even don’t know, is struggling. For example, I know many people are still waiting to receive unemployment. More people are getting food from the pantry I have set up, so I know they need help. I thought to myself, “If someone can’t feed their children today, I’m gonna have faith and I’m gonna help them get food for the week.” It’s a blessing to be able to bless others.  I was a little more prepared than most people. At the beginning of the lockdown, I had enough savings to last for two months. I was able to get extensions on a few of my debts, so this decreased my monthly debts temporarily. I still paid my tithes accordingly, but I decided that $50 a month for charitable giving wasn’t enough. So I increased the amount to $100. Very recently, I was able to help a family out that wasn’t able to pay their bills, get groceries. They’re still facing eviction. I’m struggling too, but I’m not in the position that they’re in, so I helped them. I could think only of my children and I and the months ahead, or I could recognize that as of today, I have abundance and can bless someone else if I just released some of what I was blessed with. Every dollar that I’ve released to bless someone else, I’ve been able to get it back with an increase in due time.  What or who inspired you to be a blessing to others?  Christ. I’m a Christian. Part of being a Christian is walking that walk and helping others. It’s hard to say you love Christ if you aren’t loving others. What launched me into serving others before myself has been my spiritual walk.  I learned that when it comes to helping others, it’s not shoes that you take off and put back on when you’re ready. You’re always on that walk. From interacting with my children to talking with my neighbors, it’s just a part of life.  Are your kids in school?  My daughters are homeschooled. My four-year-old will be starting kindergarten this year, and she’ll be in online classes. Even though she’ll be taught online, I’m going to be her learning coach. I want to give her her wings and let her flap them a bit.  I’ve always wanted to homeschool my children and establish their foundation here at home. For my oldest, she’s already got her schedule down. She’s actually learning Spanish and sign language at home. I enjoy teaching my children, but I decided to let them get a break from me and have a different academic teacher. I want my children to learn many teaching styles and socialize with other adults in a different environment.   It sounds like you and your daughters have a great relationship. Can you tell me more about them?  So my oldest is definitely a deep thinker. Last week, she asked me if I’ve ever had my heart broken. And last night, she asked if we could do yoga together. She catches me off guard with her questions at least two times a week. You can just tell by the things she asks that she thinks a lot.  My youngest is attached to my hip. She’s my chef in training. I’ve never seen a child so interested in food the way that she is. It’s a struggle to keep her out of the kitchen. She’s also my little artist.  What would you like to do after this is all over?  I want to be able to travel with my kids. We were supposed to go to Puerto Rico for Mother’s Day. My children have never been there, and I think that’s the first big thing we’re gonna do.   They don’t have any stamps on their passports yet, but we’re gonna get there. I’ve also thought about taking them on a cruise. Mama loves to travel, and they’re my travel buddies.   How do you feel about SaverLife?  Where have you guys been all my life? That’s what first comes to mind. Discovering SaverLife was like finding a needle in the haystack—and I found that needle! SaverLife has been a real blessing to our lives. It’s great that you teach people about the importance of savings. Before I was even approved for the emergency response fund, I saw what you all were doing in communities. It was really motivational.   This pandemic has really taught a lot of people how to save. Sometimes, it’s the difference between having a roof over your head and not having one.  "}
{"prompt":"Karina’s Story: Needs Vs. Wants","completion":" Meet Karina, a PhD student in Chemistry living in Columbus, Ohio with her young son.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  Sometimes we think we need things that we really don’t need. If you just wait, you realize that you really don’t need that thing. As a kid, when I asked my mom for something, she would tell me to wait. Or she’d give me conditions – “I’ll buy it for you if you do X or Y.” And then by the time it was done, I didn’t really want it anymore.  What do you want to do after you graduate?  I want to work in an industrial setting, whether it’s analyzing food or different home products that people might be using at home for their chemical composition or contaminants. I also want to teach and continue to do outreach programs for kids to get involved in science and chemistry.  What have been your highest and lowest financial points?  Let’s start with highest. I got a pay raise and a nice bonus, which went straight into my savings. I was in a fellowship program working with a middle school teacher to design science lesson plans.  The lowest was when I didn’t have a job and had to use my savings. That was maybe six or seven years ago. It was sad to have to use my savings. I’ve been saving since I started working, because you never know. You have to save for the future.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  There’s a lot of things that you have to put together to put yourself in a good financial position. It’s not just one thing. There are so many factors that you have to consider. I learned that over a lot of different life experiences.  You need to be able to know what you need, versus what’s a luxury. You need to have money for the future and you can’t just buy everything now. It’s also good to know about investments and opportunities from your company that you can take advantage of, like a 401k plan. There are so many things that, added together, complete the big picture.  What are your goals for the future?  I would like to be able to put money into a retirement account. That’s one of my big financial goals.  I want my son to be able to enjoy his life, enjoy being a kid, and learn a lot. And when he grows up, I want him to be as financially secure as possible. If he’s in a good financial position, he can do something he likes.   What does money mean to you in your life?  I think money is just a tool to get the things that we want and need. "}

{"prompt":"Tori’s Story: Saving For A Rainy Day","completion":" Meet Tori, an internal communications specialist for a credit union who lives in Seattle, WA.   What’s it like where you live?  I’ve been in Seattle for just over three years and I love the nature and outdoorsy lifestyle that’s available here. Being so close to the mountains and water always inspires me.  I have my own studio apartment, but my lease is up in June, so I’ll have to figure out where I’m going to move to next. I know some of my rainy day fund will go toward my move this summer, so I’m preparing for that.  What’s your profession?  I manage internal communications for a credit union, and I dabble in freelance writing—specifically, music journalism—on the side.  I got into music journalism in college. I’ve always loved instruments and the arts in addition to writing. I realized that I could combine music and writing, so I started doing interviews on my own music blog, Between the Notes.  After graduating college, I started at Amazon full-time and worked for City Arts Magazine as a freelance music writer until City Arts closed due to funding issues. Unfortunately, the magazine had to close near the end of 2018 because of a lack of funding. They really tried to keep on going until they ran into financial issues.   My new job does not pay as much as my previous one, and the rent in my new apartment is higher than what I was paying before, so I had to make major adjustments to my budget to live without barely scraping by.  Did you learn any money lessons growing up?  When I was younger, I would receive loose change every week for my piggy bank or get rewarded monetarily for good grades on my report cards.  My parents actually let me make decisions with the allowance I received in my piggy bank. They helped me understand the difference between a need and a want. I also grew up rolling coins for the bank with my grandpa’s help. He would lecture me about finances, and I used to think it was the most boring thing, but now I see the value in what he had to say about money.  What do you think the value of money is?  My grandpa shared with me the envelope method. He’d divide his budget into physical envelopes: groceries, entertainment, etc. I thought it was inconvenient when I was younger, but as I’ve grown up, I realized that I do that digitally. With the envelope method, you can see where your money goes as well as see the value of saving versus how much you spend.   I’ve learned the value of saving so that when I want to buy something, the money is there.  What do your short-term goals look like now?  I like to set concrete saving goals. When I was unemployed last year and finally moved to be closer to my new job, I had to live off my savings for a while. I definitely had to budget during those times. I’m more disciplined in savings when I have a concrete goal.   I hit the $5,000 goal I made for myself in six months, which is earlier than I thought I would. Originally, I didn’t think I’d reach my goal for a year. Now I’d like to try and save an additional $1,000 in my savings account by June.  How’d you reach an ideal budget?  I stopped going to Safeway and Fred Meyer. It took a while to find the balance between saving money, but still giving myself permission to go out for fun things sometimes. I go to Costco since buying things in bulk can sometimes cost less. I cut down on going to concerts, I bring my lunch to work, and I did a lot of at home entertainment. It took a while to figure out the balance.    What are your long-term savings goals?  I want to go on an international trip and visit Italy, Greece, and England. Also, I know it feels far off, but I want to have money saved for the down payment of my future home. It would be nice to have my student loans paid off and be debt free.  Have you had to make any adjustments to your budget since the shelter-in-place mandates?  I haven’t had to make a lot of changes to my budget actually. The option to have food delivered has been the biggest temptation for extra spending. I’ve become more conscious of my overall spending habits since my grocery expenses have been a bit higher these last couple of weeks. In that sense, I’ve had to put more of my normal budget toward groceries. I guess the money I would’ve spent going out to eat is now going toward my grocery budget.  What would you like to do after things get back to normal?  I’m looking forward to seeing friends again and spending time with them. I miss going out to dinner and seeing concerts with my friends. In fact, I was supposed to see Pearl Jam in San Diego in April, but it was postponed, and the rescheduled date hasn’t been announced yet.  How has SaverLife helped you dedicate money towards your emergency account?  SaverLife has helped me intentionally start saving. Instead of telling myself that I’d save and not follow through, SaverLife helped me dedicate time and effort toward saving. Since joining, I was able to save $1,000 in my emergency funds account. From only having $50 left in my savings in September 2019 to having $1,000 by January 2020, I was proud of how far I’ve come.  What does “living within your means” mean to you?  It means being in a place where I can pay all the bills and not worry where the money comes from each month. I still want to be able to have fun money for entertainment and clothes in addition to building my emergency savings. I’m in a good spot right now financially, so I don’t have to worry as much about paying the bills.   When I first moved to Seattle, it felt like half of my money went to paying rent. It’s not sustainable long term. When I got a promotion at my previous job, I was living a bit more comfortably, but I had to take a pay cut when I got the new job and I was paying more in rent at my new place. Basically, I was having to work with more expenses and less income.  What are you primarily using SaverLife for?  I am using SaverLife to help me rebuild my emergency fund. In 2019, I was unexpectedly unemployed for three months, and I had to use most of my savings to pay rent, bills, and other expenses while I looked for a new job. A month into my new job, I moved to another apartment, which depleted the rest of my savings.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  Using SaverLife has helped me set a budget to fit my new income and expenses so I can live within my means.   I am grateful for a program like SaverLife to help keep me focused on my savings goal! I still have a way to go before I reach my end goal, but several months ago, even saving $1,000 felt impossible.   The program has been really beneficial. It’s made me think about saving money and what I put into my savings. Having the weekly incentive from Scratch & Save has been great. It’s helped me turn my thoughts about saving money into a reality. It’s a good reminder to transfer the money and not just say I’m going to do it.  "}
{"prompt":"Amy’s Story: An Essential Employee During the Coronavirus Pandemic","completion":" Meet Amy, a banker with two teenage daughters who lives in North Tazewell, Virginia.  What’s your profession?  I work at New People’s Bank and I do customer service. I do loans and I dabble in just about everything in the bank.  We have a stay-at-home order except for essential employees or groceries because of coronavirus. It’s in place until June 10. Our bank lobbies are closed but the drive-throughs are open. I still get to work, thank goodness.  Sometimes you’d think, “I’d like to stay at home.” But really, I feel blessed that I still have a paycheck right now.  What do you like about the community in North Tazewell?  It’s a small community, a small town. I’ve lived here my whole life. I just like the pace. It’s slow. I’ve visited big cities before, and I can’t imagine the hustle and bustle. It’s a safe community and I feel safe here and comfortable. It’s great to visit cities because there’s so much to do, but the feeling when you come home is just a breath of fresh air.  How did you find out about SaverLife?  The bank I work at was a partner with SaverLife for the SaverLife Bluefield campaign. On a webinar, the SaverLife representative told us we could sign up ourselves so we could tell customers about it.  What’s your living situation like?  I am married, but my husband and I don’t live together. My youngest daughter lives with me, and my husband and my oldest daughter have moved out. It’s been hard. We’re still married and there’s no divorce on the horizon. It’s more of a partnership now. I have a 15-year-old and a 13-year-old. They live pretty near us. We can actually walk to their house! I see my older daughter every day, but she’s a daddy’s girl and she wants to be with him.  What does a day in your life currently look like?  I get up, I get ready for work, and I go to work. I don’t go out to lunch anymore because I just bring it with me to work. When I get home, I fix dinner and go over my daughters’ homework with them.  My parents are in their mid-70s and they live 15 minutes away from me. I’m afraid to visit them because I am still dealing with the public. I wash my hands all day and take all kinds of precautions, but it’s still scary. My mom made Easter lunch for us, which she does every year, but I didn’t feel safe going over.  How is your family coping with what’s going on?  My daughters aren’t affected so much. My older daughter is upset that they’ve been out of school for three or four weeks. They miss their friends.  My daughters’ teachers send work to them while school is closed. It’s hard to get them to do all that work. I’m working during the day, so I can’t really monitor what they’re doing.   What do you envision for your family’s future?  In the immediate future, I would like this virus to be done! Longer-term, I’d ultimately like my kids to go to college and have a good future, where they can depend on themselves and don’t have to depend on anyone to take care of them.  My older daughter has dropped the bomb that she wants to be a diesel mechanic because that’s what her dad does. He’s a heavy equipment mechanic in a coal mine, and she really loves him and idolizes him. She wants to go to vocational school. That’s a hard career, especially for a woman! You want to tell your kids that they can do whatever they want to do, but you also have your own preferences.  She’s loved animals her whole life. In middle school, she wanted to be a vet. But now all of a sudden, she wants to be a diesel mechanic. My youngest daughter, who’s in seventh grade, told her pediatrician she wants to be a cheerleader for the 49ers.  What has the financial impact of the coronavirus crisis been for you?  It hasn’t impacted me financially, thank goodness. My husband is still working as well. We live on the Virginia side of the Virginia/West Virginia state line and the governor of West Virginia has made coal mining an essential job.  However, I don’t see nearly as much traffic and I know that a lot of Main Street businesses, mom and pop businesses, that have had to close. That’s heart-breaking.  But it’s also a bit worrisome that I’m not sure everyone is obeying the stay-at-home order. I understand that people need to get outside, but I wish everyone would do what they need to so that this can end faster.  What does money mean to you in your life?  I like money and I know it’s important, but it’s not the main thing I focus on. I don’t obsess about it.  Are you a good saver?  Yes and no. I’m a good saver, but if I have a lot saved, I’ll dip into it for this or that. I often wonder how to balance my savings with my debt, and I use my savings to pay off my debt.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I recently won a $50 gift card to Amazon! I think it’s a good motivational tool to help people save. Once you have a goal, it’s easier to visualize what you’re saving for. It gives you a motivation to save more. "}
{"prompt":"Jason’s Story: Big Dreams of Giving Back to the Community","completion":" Meet Jason, a student who’s pursuing an A.A. in Fine Arts from the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI).  How are your college classes?   We start in-person classes in January, so I’m looking forward to that. All my classes are online right now, which isn’t too bad. It helps that my generation is pretty good at using technology, but the learning experience is completely different compared to what we would’ve had in person.  You seem very busy with school. Are you also working?  I’m not working right now. I have Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). The one downside is that I can’t save more than $2,000 in a savings account. I want to get to a point where I can comfortably pay my rent and internet a month before they’re due. I still have medication to pay for, an emergency fund to build, and I just bought a printer but need ink. It’s tough that I’m limited in how much money I can actually save.  Walk me through a day in your life.  In the morning, I usually get the art supplies I need for the day and prepare for my drawing classes. When my morning classes are done, I take my dad out for lunch. He’s done so much for me growing up. At the end of the day, all we have is family. He’s also my only source of transportation. The local transportation program here in Providence is pretty limited. It either comes either too early or too late. At night, I create essential oil mixes for friends.   Recently, I was able to see some goats, which was nice. I used to have a job walking goats around a botanical garden, so it was nice to see them again.  It seems like you and your dad have a great relationship. Can you tell me more about that?  My family disowned me for being transgender and my dad is the only family I have now. When I was growing up, I didn’t know about saving too much. My parents took me to Disneyland in the 90s and maxed out their credit cards in the process. They made me peanut butter sandwiches to take to school when I was younger, but I would throw them away at lunch because I didn’t want my friends to know I was poor. Now I’m a little sad thinking about those times I did that.   I think I’m the one setting the example for my dad now. Before we started talking about money, he would go to casinos and play lottery tickets. Now I teach him things like how to earn free coffee from Dunkin Donuts. I’m becoming more resourceful as I get older and I’m happy to share that knowledge with my dad.  I’m learning from their mistakes as well as the ones I made in the past. When I got money for Christmas growing up, I was quick to spend it. My advice to people would be: “Save your birthday and Christmas money.”   In our  November to Remember  initiative, you shared the small business Colorful Cute Goods. How did you discover that business and can you tell me more about it?   I’m all about supporting small businesses. Actually, I was able to interview the owner of  Colorful Cute Goods  to talk about how they got started. In February of 2017, Madeline Bustamonte launched the brand. It was a big jump for her and she said it took a while for her to really believe she could be a small business owner.  Her inspiration came from customer requests. She’s always looking for unique and different items that are still affordable for her customers. When I asked her if she had any advice for those interested in starting a business, she said, “Grow into it, don’t go into it.” Some people like to jump into all the bells and whistles, but you’ll end up paying more than you bargained for if you’re not ready. She tries to keep herself accountable because at the end of the day, she’s her own boss.  I was inspired by Madeline’s determination! She started out selling her items at booths and craft fairs and she’s grown from there. She now has almost  10,000 followers on her Instagram . I really admire that she took a chance on her dreams!  What are you looking forward to doing after college?  One of my far-fetched goals is that I want to do composite pictures of missing people. I want to improve my skills and be able to draw people as they looked like when they were young and then draw them as they’d look now. I took criminology and ceramics courses in addition to art and I want a way to combine what I learned.   I’ve also thought of becoming an elementary school art teacher. Growing up, my art teachers always made me feel special and I want to be able to do that for other kids. I want to give back to my community the way they gave back to me.  Do you have student loans?   My college tuition is covered by FAFSA. I also received two awards from my college, the Book Award and the Presidential Award, which have helped me cover any other education expenses I have.  What do the holidays look like for you this year?  I don’t have any plans whatsoever. It sucks. The pandemic put a wrench in a lot of our plans. For Thanksgiving, my dad and I are just going to IHOP. We’re not going out as much now and our county may go back to having phase one restrictions. As of last Sunday, we have a statewide 10pm curfew here in Rhode Island. You can’t leave your house unless you’re going to grab essentials.   What would you like to do when things get better and the world opens up?  I can’t wait to have doctors come to me and take me where I need to go. One of the biggest struggles I have is that I can’t read facial expressions well. I can’t wait until things are normal and I can see people’s faces. Before the pandemic, I was learning how to cook. I definitely want to learn more life skills in general. I started making my own grilled cheese sandwiches and last week I even made my own chocolate! My dad is the taste tester for everything I make.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  Oh my gosh, I’m on there every day. I especially like checking out the  forum  and responding to members. I won  Scratch & Save  twice, which was nice. I also received one of the  Emergency Response Fund  grants. I had never held $500 in my hand before. The feeling you get from someone helping you, it inspires a chain reaction. I love the way that you all project yourself on the internet. The amount of people I see getting help on social media is awesome.     "}
{"prompt":"Nade’s Story: A Bronx Business Owner","completion":" This Bronx business owner was expecting a new member to the family, but never thought she’d be facing a pandemic.   Welcoming a new baby in the time of coronavirus is scary enough. But for pregnant mother Nade, who is expecting her third child next month, concern for her health and her baby’s is compounded by the sudden financial freefall that is threatening her family. Nade, who lives with her husband and her two children (3 and 24) in the Bronx, runs her own cleaning business with two employees. When the coronavirus crisis hit, Nade’s income disappeared overnight. No longer able to pay her employees, she soon found she couldn’t even cover her own expenses.   “With the crisis, the offices we usually clean are all closed. They owe me money, but no one is paying me….I am almost due, and I don’t have money to get the things I need for my baby.”   Nade’s husband, a taxi driver, is also unable to work during the crisis. Nade is terrified she will have to give birth alone, since her OB/GYN told her that her husband would only be able to join her in the delivery room if he shows no signs of illness; the family is doing their best to stay healthy while living in the heart of the pandemic. With so much to worry about, Nade and her husband’s complete and unforeseen loss of income is an untenable burden.   However, in spite of the intense pressure they are under, the couple is striving to stay positive, for the sake of the family. “We are really trying to create a good environment for all of us. When everyone is home, you wake up together, you go to sleep together, you’re always together. So we are trying to not make it stressful for everyone,” she said.  In addition to trying to care for her own family, Nade is concerned about her employees. She is trying to enroll in the paycheck protection plan in order to get financial relief. “It wouldn’t even be for me, I would just use it to pay them. I really hope it works out… I have been so busy with working on the application,” she said.   Nade is optimistic that once the crisis blows over, she will be able to return to cleaning and ensure a strong future for her family, including the new addition. “My hope is that my clients will pay their outstanding bills, and once this is over I can get more clients and contracts, and keep growing the business,” she said.  Until she can get back to work, Nade is stretching her dollars to provide for her family. SaverLife partnered with Neighborhood Trust to disburse a $1,000  Emergency Response Fund  payment from Humanity Forward to Nade and many other Bronx residents. The money was enough to pay rent for the month, with a little left over for essentials. “All of us who received the payment, it made a really positive impact on our lives. Whether you use it for rent, electricity, or groceries–it just takes the weight off our shoulders a little bit,” she said.  "}
{"prompt":"Congratulations to our #StashThatCash Contest Winners","completion":" We asked our SaverLife members how they like to #StashThatCash and build their emergency savings fund. Whether it was by couponing, growing a garden, or filling up a coin jar, we loved reading all your savvy ways to save!  Here are the winners and their explanations for how they like to #StashThatCash.  Third Place: Maria D. from Georgia 🥉   So, I… 1. Wrote everything I spent money on for a month. 2. Evaluated and eliminated unnecessary expenses…ex. Cable (did not watch anyway), music app, excess groceries that used to go bad, etc. 3. Created a very detailed budget that included Savings as a necessary expense. 4. Put the money away and forgot about it. Once I started following my budget it really made it really easy to put the money away and not find myself needing it. So, for me, a budget is KEY to savings.  Second Place: Meg T. from Texas 🥈   Setting financial goals and using a budget tracking app then adjusting it yearly is crucial. An IRA is where future cash goes. Money goals are great but what about having fun? I use coupons and cash back apps to save money on everything from food, clothing, needed appliances and gifts. I’ve had a piggy bank for years where all loose change goes because let’s face it! We have to make some wiggle room to dive into fun and this is how I #stashthatcash!  First Place: Ashley M. from Illinois 🥇   I #StashThatCash by keeping it digital! Loose cash and coins get spent quickly. So I deposit my cash quickly and only charge (to my credit card) what I know I can repay when bills are due. I use the Digit app to automatically save little amounts daily for a rainy day fund. I’ve saved over 2K and it’s definitely come in handy! I also use CashApp to accept babysitting payments. I always cash out “standard” so I get ALL of my money and never have to pay a fee. #StashThatCash all day every day!   "}

{"prompt":"Want to Save Money on Your Monthly Internet Bill?","completion":"    Could you use a HUGE discount on your monthly internet bill? Do you need new equipment (laptop, desktop computer, or tablet) for yourself or a family member? You might be able to take advantage of the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) program.  You could receive up to  $50/month or $75/month discount  on your monthly internet bill  You could get a  one-time discount of up to $100 for a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet Tens of millions of Americans are still eligible  for the EBB program who have not yet applied  Who is eligible?   Have you experienced  any  of the following?   Experienced a substantial loss of income since February 29, 2020 and had a total income in 2020 at or below $99,000 for single filers and $198,000 for joint filers Have received SNAP/FreshEBT benefits Have been approved to receive benefits under the free and reduced-price school lunch program or the school breakfast program, including through the  USDA Community Eligibility Provision , in the 2019-2020, 2020-2021, or 2021-2022 school year Have received low-income housing (Section 8) assistance Received a federal Pell Grant in the current award year If you qualify (or already receive benefits from) the  Lifeline program Have an income at or below 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines If you meet the eligibility criteria for a participating broadband internet service provider’s existing low-income or COVID-19 program  How to Apply  There are three ways to apply:  1.  By visiting  GetEmergencyBroadband.org  You DO NOT have to provide your Social Security Number (SSN) during the application process.   2.  Through a participating internet service provider’s website  Use this tool  to find a participating broadband provider. Participating companies can help you with the application process.  3.  By mail  Call (833) 511-0311 for a mail-in application or print an application (available in  English  and  Spanish ) and mail it to:   Emergency Broadband Support Center  P.O. Box 7081  London, KY 40742  Note : If you’re applying through the FCC or by mail, there are two steps: 1) Application process 2) Finding a provider  If you’re applying directly through your provider, there is no 2-step process.  Here are the top five participating internet service providers   AT&T : Offering fixed and wireless internet service Comcast : Offering fixed internet services Cox : Offering fixed internet service and devices T-Mobile : Offering fixed and wireless internet service along with devices Verizon : Offering fixed and mobile internet service  Here’s the difference between  fixed and wireless internet  Frequently Asked Questions  “ Will I receive a check every month to use toward my internet expenses? ”  The funding for the EBB goes directly to internet providers. These providers will take $50 to $75 of peoples’ monthly internet bills if they qualify and apply for the EBB program. This means: you will not directly receive a check to pay for your internet bill. The discount will appear on your internet bill. If your monthly bill is lower than your discount, you WILL NOT receive money back. At that point, your internet bill will be $0.  “ Do I still qualify  if I split my internet bill with another family in my house ? ”  It’s important to note that there can only be one benefit  per household . Use  this household worksheet  to determine your household’s eligibility for the EBB program. A household is a group of people who live together who share money— even if they’re not related . If you either don’t live together or you don’t share money, you are two or more households.  “ I live in an apartment building. Do I qualify? ”  Households with multi-unit dwellings (apartments, nursing homes, group homes) may be able to apply.  A household can qualify because of eligible dependent children that meet the eligibility criteria (see “Who is eligible?” bullet points above).  “ When will the EBB Program end? ”  The EBB is a temporary program developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program will end once the program funds are exhausted, or six months after the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) declares an end to the pandemic—whichever comes first.  Participating internet providers must give households notice about the last date or billing cycle that the full benefit will apply to their bill (not date specific). Households will need to opt-in or request to continue broadband services with that same provider. If households don’t opt-in, the internet provider will automatically opt them out.   Reminder : If you’re already in the  Lifeline program , you do not have to provide documentation to sign up for EBB. Upon signing up for EBB through the national verifier, a provider will see that the eligible participant qualifies.  Families across the country use broadband to work, learn, talk with their doctors, and manage their money. SaverLife families have had to pay more for and upgrade their broadband during the pandemic. Here at SaverLife, we know that the EBB is a vital program, and it’s critical that more families know that help is available. "}

{"prompt":"Madeline & Kristi’s Story: Working Together is the Dream","completion":" Meet Madeline ( M ) and Kristi ( K ), two best friends who both live and work in Mississippi.   What’s your profession?  K : I’ve been a hairstylist for 20 years now. I absolutely love my job and talking with my customers. We laugh together, connect, and I enjoy getting to interact with so many different personalities.  M : I’ve had several jobs over the years, but my profession has mainly been customer service. Just like Kristi, I like talking to people. I found out that you can have that personal connection with people in the nail tech field, so I’m excited to pursue that.  How did you two meet?  M : We met in high school. At the time, we were both playing basketball and found out we lived just a few houses away from each other.  K : We attended college together as well! We both went to Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College.  What’s your household like?  M : I’m a single parent of three children and we live at our home.  K : I’m also a single parent, but I live with my mom and dad. One of my kids is in college and the other is a senior in high school.   Walk me through a day in your life.  K : On a regular day when I’m working, I start my day at 6am. I wake up, get dressed, and I arrive at work around 6 of 7am. Since my son’s doing his school work online, I try to help him with whatever he needs. My parents have also been there to help me whenever I need them. After I’m done with work, I come home, cook, and make sure everybody eats dinner.  M : I’m an early riser, too. I wake up at 5:30am, get the kids ready for school, make sure they get on the bus, prepare dinner for that night, then clean up around the house. My 20-year-old and I take nail technician classes together, so on the days we have classes, my father helps me with my kids from 3pm-9pm. He helps them with their homework and makes sure they eat.  What does school look like for your kids this year?  K : My daughter came home last year for spring break, and she’s been going to school online ever since. She attends Ole Miss, but thankfully she only has one in-person class this semester. As for my son, he’s also taking his high school classes online.  M : My youngest kids are going to school in-person. They like it so far, and they were definitely ready to go back. I wanted them to do distance learning, but I waited too long to register them.  Madeline, you said Kristi inspired you to pursue your dream of becoming a nail technician. Could you tell me more about that?  M : That day was a real blessing. I just got my nails done that day, and the lady who did them was telling me about the nail technician courses she took. That’s when I first started thinking about getting certified as a nail tech. Kristi had called me later that day because she said I was on her mind. She told me that I should go for my dream!  K :  I always try to call Madeline and uplift her. I like to remind her that she doesn’t have to settle for less than she deserves. Often, I’ll say, “You may be going through a storm now, but you’ll come out soon. You have purpose. You’ve got a destiny.” I’ve known her for a long time. She has such a big heart, and I pray for her.   Tell me about a favorite memory you two share.  M : There are just too many to count! In high school, Kristi played a trick on me and pushed me down the street in a shopping cart. We just kept laughing!  K : Also in high school, we were at Madeline’s grandmother’s house when we decided to phone a psychic. It was one of those 1-800 pay per minute gigs where the first minute is free, but the psychic always tries to stretch out their words. When Madeline’s mom got the phone bill the next month, she said to us, “The next time you want to talk to a psychic, I’ll be your psychic!”   Are either of you currently saving for anything in particular?  M : I’m saving and trying to increase my credit score. Eventually, I want to become a homeowner.   K : I’m saving, too. Each year, I try to put money in a new CD because I’m trying to help my kids build generational wealth. I’m also saving to start my own business.  Tell me more about the business you’d like to open.  K : I’ve been the co-owner of the barber shop/hair salon where I work for the past 13 years, but I want to have my own business one day. It’s been great so far! I just want a space where I can be creative and see my ideas come to life. I already have a name for my business: Slay Hair Oils and More.  As a hairstylist, I’ve seen how issues with hair can really affect a woman’s self-esteem. Last year, the Lord gave me this vision of developing a hair oil that stops your hair from shedding and makes it soft. With His help, I was able to create a product that helps with those issues.  M : Kristi is going to be very successful. She has the personality for it and she’s a great people person!  Do you have any advice for someone who’s just starting to learn about money?  K : Find good investments that work for you. That may be CDs, stocks, or real estate. You have to think in the mindset of “How can I increase what I already have?” Also, don’t spend frivolously. Compare interest rates at banks and watch out for fees. Check out your credit report and see if there’s anything on there that can be disputed. You have to think about your future when you want to save.  M : Pay yourself first. Even if it’s only 10% of your paycheck, pay yourself first. Remember to check your credit score from time to time. Use your phone to your advantage. There are so many great apps that can help you manage your money. They’re not called smart phones for nothing!  How do you feel about SaverLife?  M : I love SaverLife! I was introduced to it through a home ownership program. I’m always looking for ways to save and be better with my money. The member stories are really inspirational. I also enjoy playing Scratch & Save weekly, and I’ve actually won a few times. The Race to $100 is great, too! "}
{"prompt":"Tiffany’s Story: 100% Self-Made, Independent, and Proud of It","completion":" Meet Tiffany, an insurance company Customer Service Expert who lives in Michigan with her six-year-old son.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I was always a hard worker and strived to make my own money. I’ve saved money to buy the things I wanted or felt I deserved. I pride myself on being able to provide my son with many of his wants.  What’s the best purchase you’ve made?  I’m most proud of purchasing my house 14 years ago with no help. There were no co-signers involved in the process. I decided that it would be a smarter investment than renting. I plan to forever have this house as a part of my family. It’ll also be an opportunity to leave it as an inheritance for my son. It means so much to me. It’s not a big house. It’s the perfect size for my son and me. I’ve done a lot of remodeling and redecorating to make it person to me. I set a goal and I work on it.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Don’t depend on anyone else to fund your dreams. I was given that piece of advice when I bought my house. I didn’t factor in financial help from anyone else when I thought about my ability to pay for my home.  What’s one thing you know about money now that you wish you knew when you were younger?  Don’t sign up for those credit cards while you’re in college. Those credit cards are the devil. They get you through your college years, but they’re your worst enemy once you graduate. Once you’re working, all those helpful perks go away. They don’t raise your credit limit anymore or give you any forgiveness. It’s okay to have one credit card for emergencies, but really treat it as such.  I utilize my credit cards now for the benefits. When it’s time to go on vacation, I use the points. I also use them to build my credit.  What are your goals for the future?  I’m trying to save up for my son to go to college. I would love for him to go to my alma mater, Michigan State University. I want to make sure he doesn’t have any financial burdens when he goes to school like I did.  How did you finance college?  I had a full tuition scholarship, but it didn’t include housing, so I had to take out loans for that.  What financial lessons do you want to pass on to your son?  I want to teach him about the importance of having an emergency fund. Always have your own life insurance that’s separate from your work provided policy. Definitely have that piece of financial stability and budgeting.  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money is freedom. It’s the ability to do the things you enjoy and not be dependent on others. "}
{"prompt":"Julie’s Story: Waiting for Unemployment Insurance to Come Through","completion":" Meet Julie, a mother of three children who lives in Lempster, New Hampshire.   Walk me through a day in your life.  I’m not working at the moment, so I’m able to help my three kids with their online school. On a normal weekday, we get up and do our morning routine. We usually do schoolwork in the afternoon because getting them to do school in the morning is tough. Every week is different. The biggest thing that’s affecting me right now is my kids not being in school in-person and full-time. Right now, they’re going to school two days a week, and the other three days they’re here at home with me. And my oldest kid is going to school fully remote, so she doesn’t even go on campus.  When it’s time to relax, we watch tv, eat dinner at the table together, and sometimes they play on their phones.  How are your kids feeling about everything?  They really want to be in school. My son especially wants to be in school because he has an Individualized Education Program (IEP) and his school isn’t doing enough to meet his needs as he does his school work from home.   How did you feel about winning a cash prize from our November Race to $100?  I was happy that I won something! That money went toward our light bill—every little bit helps.  Have you applied to receive unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic?  Yes, I have. After I applied for unemployment insurance, it took four months for my paperwork to be processed. Because of the delay, I’ve been behind on a lot of bills. It’s been a real nightmare.   After my boyfriend and I wrote to the governor’s office, it seemed like our unemployment insurance funds were expedited. We were finally able to pay rent. Unfortunately, since my boyfriend works in multiple states for his job, he had out-of-state wages he had to claim. He didn’t receive as much as he could have when he claimed unemployment because our state’s unemployment online portal is a joke. The online portal kept showing that his out-of-state wages were $0, which just wasn’t true.    What have you been doing to budget?  Budgeting has been a nightmare. My son and I both receive social security insurance and we live off of that. We’re on a fixed income right now, so it’s hard to save. I have to pay rent and bills, and after budgeting for that, I can’t save.   I just got a car because we needed a new one, so now I’m working on including a car payment into our monthly budget, too.   What are you looking forward to doing when things are better?  I just want stuff to go back to normal and the schools to have full-time, in-person classes again. Our town’s local school only has 100 students total and there haven’t been any COVID-19 cases, but they’re being overly cautious. Our school said things are probably never going to go back to normal.  Are you saving for anything in particular?  I’m just trying to get caught up on bills. I feel like I could’ve saved if the world didn’t close and my boyfriend and I weren’t out of our jobs for months. He was a delivery person for restaurants, and when a lot of them closed, they didn’t need him anymore.   How do you feel about SaverLife?  I found it through the Fresh EBT Facebook page. Ever since, I’ve been reading the  Money 101 articles  and  earning Scratch & Save cards  when I can. I wish I had heard about SaverLife before the pandemic. "}
{"prompt":"Bob’s Story: A Father and Business Owner Dedicated to Achieving Financial Freedom","completion":" Bob is an attorney who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico with his wife and three kids. Although he had a successful career and owned a side business with his wife, the family still struggled with budgeting and debt.   Six years ago, Bob got in a car accident that pushed him in a new financial direction.   “I had no savings, no IRA, no pension, and $44,000 in credit card debt,” he said. “I was concerned about my family because I did not have savings.”   Bob took a money management class that changed how he thought about finances.    “I took a focused approach to money,” Bob said. “My goal was to hone in on paying down debt while also building up retirement and investments.”  In 2019, Bob and his wife joined SaverLife after finding out about the program at FinCon. Joining SaverLife helped Bob build his emergency savings.   “It’s always in the background as an accountability thing,” Bob said. “It helps you get more control over your financial health.”   In September 2020, Bob wiped out the last of that $44,000 in credit card debt. He said the competitive aspects of SaverLife, such as the weekly chance to win $5 from  Scratch & Save , help encourage him to save.   Bob was chosen as a finalist for SaverLife’s first Super Saver of the Year in December 2020 and won $1,000. He planned to put some of the money into emergency savings and the rest into sinking funds.   Bob’s newfound financial freedom has allowed him and his wife to turn their nonprofit work teaching kids about robotics into a business.   “Having an emergency fund has made life more enjoyable and less stressful,” Bob said. “Now I’m able to help other folks.” "}
{"prompt":"Siairra’s Story: Raising a Child During the Covid-19 Shutdown","completion":" Meet Siairra, a stay-at-home mother who lives with her 18-month-old son and fiancé in upstate New York.   What’s your profession?  Right now, I’m stay-at-home mom. I was a manager before my son was born, but I left my job soon after I had him. The transition from manager to stay-at-home mom was hard. I moved from Florida when my son was only nine days old.   What’s life like where you live?  We recently moved to Ogdensburg, New York, which is where my fiancé was born. This is his home. It’s so upstate that it’s basically Canada! We’re only two miles from the border and we can see Canada from the river by our house.   We first moved to upstate New York because my fiancé and I had a baby and a pit bull, and we couldn’t find anywhere in Florida where I’m from that accepted that breed of dog. That’s when we decided to move.   It’s been a culture shock living here. This is the only city in the county we live in, and it’s really different from Tampa Bay, which is the kind of city I’m used to. The homes are close, but this city is full of older folks. They’ve got a prison here, a mental institution, and a movie theater that’s been closed for 10 years. Unfortunately, the city hasn’t progressed in 10 years because it drives young people away with high taxes.   In terms of seasons, the fall and summer are great. The library has some fun events for kids, too. Volunteers come to help make crafts and we have social hours.   How are you and your family coping with the coronavirus?  I’m doing better than I originally thought I would. I was more nervous at first, but then again, I get anxiety about things like getting gum off my shoes.  My fiancé is an essential worker and has two jobs. He works during the daytime five days a week at a factory that makes computer boards for hospitals, and two to three days a week he works a night shift at Frito Lay. It makes avoiding exposure very hard. You’re fighting an invisible enemy all day every day. If you don’t work, you may not have a job when things go back to normal.  I always budget four months ahead, so we’re financially prepared. I was proactive about buying essential items before people were buying the stores out, so that puts my mind at ease.  What does your son think about what’s happening?   My wild child of a son is as happy as can be and couldn’t care less about what’s going on. He’s also only 18 months. He’s going through his terrible twos early, I think. Most days, I don’t have time to think about the coronavirus because I’m looking after my very active son.  He’s pretty much on the same schedule as before all this started. He used to go the gas station and run errands with me, but I don’t think he’s noticed that changed. Now, instead of going from establishment to establishment, we just go from room to room a few times a day. We try to keep him busy, which means these days he’s allowed to make way bigger messes than I would usually allow. He has more toys than he knows what to do with.  What does a day in your life currently look like?   My fiancé wakes up and goes to work at the factory early. My son then wakes up around 8am and comes in our room with his blanket, kisses me up on my forehead, and says, “Awww” to me. Usually, he’ll grab the remote and we’ll watch tv, read a book, eat breakfast, play a game, and listen to music. My fiancé gets his lunch break at 12, so we’ll go downstairs to make food and eat with him. Then comes nap time for my son, which lasts about two hours. When he’s done, he’ll stroll out of his room, we’ll read, and have a dance party.  By 3:30 in the afternoon, my fiancé is done with work. He takes a shower first thing when he gets back and then he gives me a little break and watches our son. We make dinner around 5:30pm, then he goes to Frito Lay after dinner if he’s needed. If he goes, I give the baby a bath, put on his jammies, sometimes we finger paint or plays with toys, and then he’s out like a light by 8pm.   My fiancé comes back from his second job around 8pm, then we start our night routine. He takes a shower, we watch YouTube videos, the news, then something funny to lighten the mood, then Joe Rogan videos, and we’re in bed by 10:30 or 11pm.  Instead of going to the grocery store multiple times a week like I used to, I only go once a week—if that. My life is pretty much the same as it always was except for going to the store more infrequently these days.  What’s it like going to Walmart nowadays?  I used to get really bad panic attacks, but I haven’t had them recently. The other day, I saw the signs about social distancing and staying six feet apart and it made me anxious. Inside the store, there were announcements about social distancing, washing hands, and people were wearing masks and dodging one another. I’m only 25 and I haven’t seen anything like this in my lifetime. It’s definitely eerie.  How do you envision your family’s future?  We have a 5-year plan. I do hope that everything gets back to normal soon.   I crave human interaction. Before all this happened, I was looking for something to do after my husband went back to work, but I don’t want to put myself at risk. Hopefully, I can get a job around my fiancé’s schedule. When I get a job, my income will be what we put into our savings.   My fiancé and I were also supposed to get married in July, but now we’re getting married next July in 2021. I have photos of my parents when I was my son’s age at their wedding, and I really want to recreate those photos with our son.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I really like it! Recently I won $5 through Scratch & Save, which was nice. I really love the idea of the different savings challenges. I love all the articles on the website from people because it’s from their different perspectives.  Who doesn’t like free money for doing something you already do?  "}
{"prompt":"Tamiko’s Story: Pay Yourself First","completion":" Meet Tamiko: Tamiko lives in Dothan, Alabama with her two children, Ayonna (13) and Aidan (8). She has worked as an administrative assistant for her church for 16 years.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My mom was a single parent, so she always managed money. It was a struggle for me, but as I got older and had kids, I saw that I needed to save money.  My mother had savings accounts, one in particular called her “emergency cash” to keep at home. She put away money out of each paycheck.  When I was younger, I didn’t think about saving. But as I got older, I had bills and I realized I can’t spend the way I wanted to, as though I was younger. When you have kids, the dependency is on you now.  What are the lowest and highest financial points in your life?  My highest point would probably be now because I have money to do the things I couldn’t do.  My lowest point was during the time I was transitioning away from my kids’ father. All the financial responsibilities fell on me. At some point, I couldn’t see a way to pay for it all.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  My grandmother’s sister used to say, “Pay yourself first.” At first I didn’t understand what she was saying, but then she said, “You know what your bills are every month, but put $20 or $30 aside first. Think of yourself first.”  I try to do that now. If I don’t save the money, I’ll treat myself and the kids to something special.  What are your goals for the future?  I’m working to finish up my bachelor’s degree and get a job in my chosen field, and to be financially stable. I’m getting my degree in health administration. In the past, I’ve worked in hospitals, and I’d love to get back to that in an administration role.  I only have one course and I’ll be done by the end of the year. I’m so excited!  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money means stability, being able to pay and do the things you want to do without asking anybody for it. It’s freedom. "}
{"prompt":"Kimberly’s Story: A Flourishing Business Shut Down by COVID-19","completion":" COVID-19 has forced businesses all over New York–from restaurants to retail–to shut down for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, that includes the stores where Kimberly Hall sources all the inventory for her online clothing business.   “I am an online reseller. Mostly I resell women’s and men’s, and some kids, designer clothing, accessories, and shoes. I source most of my inventory from existing retail establishments, sometimes from Goodwill or Salvation Army or even Macy’s,” she said. All of the usual places Kimberly shops for her inventory have had to close down, leaving her with no way to replenish her stock.   “I remember the day exactly, March 17th. I was shopping for inventory, and the manager of the store asked everyone to come to the front. They announced that this would be the last day open, until further notice. It’s been very difficult as far as replenishing inventory. I have really had to think outside the box,” said Kimberly.   With no inventory to sell, Kimberly receives no income, and can’t pay her expenses. In addition to her lack of stock, Kimberly’s overall sales have plummeted due to the economic recession. “People have lost their jobs, or they’re furloughed, or they’re very nervous about whether they will still have a job. So luxury clothing is not at the top of their priorities,” she said.   Kimberly tried to apply for unemployment, which has been expanded in New York to include small business owners. But she first applied three weeks ago, and is still navigating the process to receive benefits. While waiting for her unemployment, Kimberley received a $1,000 disbursement from Humanity Forward through a  partnership between SaverLife and Neighborhood Trust .     “Anyone who does what I do, we pay selling fees. The more you sell, the higher the fees. So I used some of it to pay my selling fees,” said Kimberly. Kimberly also used some of the payment to pay her cell phone bill; she often uses her cell phone for business as well as keeping in touch with family and friends since she lives alone. The rest, Kimberly put into her savings account.   “I have just reserved the rest since I have yet to receive any other financial help and my business is just a trickle right now. I can’t spend it all at once, even for necessities.”   As a small business owner, Kimberly is used to riding out tight times, but the COVID crisis has been especially challenging. “I am still maintaining my business as best I can. The minute the stores open back up, I will be the first in line,” she said.   We are glad to have been able to give Kimberly some financial security while she waits to get back to work. “I am so thankful for the grant because it really was needed and came just in time,” she said.

{"prompt":"Andrea’s Story: Money is About Having Options","completion":" Meet Andrea, who lives in Connecticut and loves video game memorabilia.  What do you do?  I’m not employed at the moment. I have been employed in the past, but it’s been a while. At the moment, I’m trying to figure out some things before diving back into employment.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My parents definitely made a lot of mistakes, so in some ways I learned what not to do, in terms of saving more than you spend and pay things more on time. It made me look at what you should do better, more than what to proactively do.  I saw a lot that wasn’t a good example. Some of that was them not knowing or not being in a good situation. It’s surprising in retrospect because my mom worked at a bank.  What’s one thing you know about money now that you wish you knew when you were younger?  It really does create options when you have money. It opens doors. When I was younger, I was living more in the moment and not seeing the future, not seeing that you need to set aside a lot of money.  I did save and budget to a certain extent, which has kept me afloat lately. But I had more of a desire to just get what I wanted then.  There were also just some things that I didn’t know – for example, that there are some bank accounts that give you more interest. I didn’t know about that, that my money could be earning more interest over time without me doing anything. I didn’t think about the long-term implications of that.  The other thing that I knew nothing about, even though I had the option, was creating an investment account. I thought, “That’s an extra thing. I don’t need to do it.”  What have been the highest and lowest financial points in your life?  The past couple of years since my divorce have been my lowest. My highest was when I was married. My husband made a decent living and I didn’t have to think about that or worry about it. We worked well with what he had and were able to support ourselves and our child, who’s now an adult.  If I had seen ahead, I would have saved more while married or kept a part-time job. I never saw myself in the position I’m in now.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  It goes beyond “pay yourself first.” Save more than you spend. Don’t spend more than what’s necessary. If you don’t need it, don’t get it. Your priorities should be all about saving.  Any spending that you do, can you get it cheaper? Can you wait? Can you just not get it?  I wish I had had that mindset always, not about instant gratification. I wish I had given purchases more thought.  Now I look at some items I have, and I think, “that could have been money in the bank compounding interest.”  Are there any purchases you’ve made that you still think are good even with that mindset?  Yes and no – it’s conflicting. There are some things that I still have and enjoy, so I am getting pleasure out of them.  For me specifically, this might be a silly or unexpected answer, but I have been a collector of video game memorabilia. That was where a lot of my money has gone – not shoes or clothes that you might think a lot of women want.  On one hand, I maybe shouldn’t have made those purchases, but they do make me happy. And I’ve been able to make money back when I sold some of them. It was fun to meet other collectors when I was selling and connect with other people who have similar interests.  I guess my advice would be not to give up your interests or cut it out of your life, but be thoughtful about what you actually want.  At my age, I’m still really interested, but I need to really cut back. I feel okay about cutting back. Less can be more.  What are your goals for the future?  I’m trying to figure out how to be on my own because this is new. I went straight from my parents to being married. I’m trying to figure out how to be alone at this age with my adult child living away from me.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It means options or lack of them. "}
{"prompt":"Katoya’s Story: COVID-19 Made her Family Have to Live Separately","completion":" Meet Katoya, the supervisor for a post office who lives with her husband and four kids in Hosston, LA.  Tell me what goes on in a day in your life.  Work, home, and kids. That’s basically it. We’ll go on an adventure as a family every now and then.  How has your family been dealing with sheltering in place?  We actually had to split up. With my work schedule and how busy I’ve been at the post office, it’s not like I can leave my kids at home. I work six days a week, sometimes 10 hours each day. I’ve been busier with work since March, and my hours have definitely increased. They’ve probably doubled at this point. Before COVID, I was working part-time, and now I’m working full-time.  And my husband is a truck driver who works weekdays Monday through Friday. It’s nice when he’s home on the weekends because he can help with picking up the kids and whatnot.  My kids and I have a routine down at this point. I’m out of work by 4:35pm, I pick up the boys from their babysitter, then I get ready to be up by 5am the next morning.  My girls are 11 and 13 years old, so they’re too old for daycare. They’ve been staying with my parents since school let out in March, and my other kids are with a babysitter while I’m at work.  What does going back to school look like for you and your kids this fall?  My kids  have  to go back to school. They need the interaction. My 4-year-old is a little behind because he’s going from just having a babysitter teach him to attending pre-K.  Are you saving right now?  Short-term, I start saving for my family’s Christmas presents right about now. I have direct deposit set up so each time I get my check, a certain amount is automatically routed to a separate savings account. I’ve had that savings account since I was 16 years old. I don’t see the money, so I don’t miss it.   I’m not necessarily saving for anything long-term, but I am managing my money better so I can fix my credit. I want to buy myself a nice car in the next two years. In order to do that, I have to fix my credit. Right now, I’m just learning to save money and get my bills paid off.  What are you looking forward to doing when things are safer?  I really would like to take a family day. I used to rotate Saturdays just so we could do a family activity and eat out every other weekend, but now I work Saturdays. We used to go to the movies, skate, go to the park—all kinds of stuff.   Tell me about your greatest financial accomplishment.  I was able to purchase a car using cash, and just a few years ago I bought a house.  When I was saving to buy a car, I just put away money until I reached the max amount of what I was willing to spend on a car. The process wasn’t hard; it was more tempting not to touch the money.  My house buying process was a bit different compared to what most people go through. I first bought property back in 2015 when I was 28 years old. Then I was living in an apartment with my four kids for a while. When I turned 30, I bought us a mobile home.   Do you budget these days?  It’s easier right now because I’m making more money, so I’m able to expand my budget a little. I have money for other things. I don’t really budget, but I just make sure my bills are paid, then I’ll usually have $200 to $300 left over to spend. We’re not living paycheck to paycheck, so we’ve got a bit more breathing room. However, my husband and I have to budget his overhead from his truck business. The trucking business is expensive.  I no longer have to say to myself, “I have to work X hours to make $XXX to pay my bills.”  Could you tell me more about what it was like living paycheck to paycheck?   It was a struggle.  When my husband bought his truck, we were living off of my paycheck. We had just moved into our mobile home with the kids. It takes a lot to get a truck on the road as an operator. We learned that running a business is not always about profit. It’s about breaking even and keeping your head above water. He has to have food, tires, diesel—the list goes on. At first, it was a struggle to find the right company that he could make a profit working for. All in all, a truck’s overhead costs are about $10,000 a year. It’s a lot more than what people think.  How’s it been with you and your husband both working?  I’m making more money, and he can pick when he wants to work. We’re actually able to save for rainy days and times when my husband might be down for a week because his truck is in the auto shop.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather additional costs during the pandemic?  We haven’t had to dip into our savings because we’re constantly working and earning more money than we were used to. We’ve been able to actually put more money in our savings account.  I noticed we don’t spend as much on eating out or buying frivolous things. My girls are staying with their grandparents, so there go my shopping buddies. I just really go to work, pick up my younger kids, then shop at the grocery store. Shopping for groceries online has helped me budget. Instead of going to the store and walking around the aisles, you can just have someone shop for what you need.  How are your girls doing since they’re not at home?  My girls help their grandma with her t-shirt business. Since they’re earning money now, they want to spend it. They tell me they’re going out to McDonald’s or buying hair for $50, so I had to talk to them about saving money.  It’s a learning trait; it’s something that’s taught. My mom taught me how to spend, but now I’m teaching my daughters how to save. I don’t want them to live paycheck to paycheck when they’re older. My husband is a saver, but he’s not around them as much as I am, so they pick up on my habits.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I really like it! I even introduced my girls and my mom to the  helpful articles  on the website. "}
{"prompt":"Everything You Need to Know About Voting by Mail","completion":" When you think about voting, you may think about standing in line at your neighborhood polling place with your friends and neighbors, waiting your turn to cast a vote you feel proud of — one that will result in laws and policies that support your finances and your values.  But that’s not the only way to vote. And for many people, it’s certainly not the most convenient or safe way to vote.      Absentee voting, or voting by mail, has become much more mainstream lately. And whether you vote in person or by mail, it’s still public record that you took the time to cast a vote and participate in democracy.  But like everything else voting-related, the rules for absentee voting vary state by state.   Here are four things you need to know about absentee voting:  1. Your state’s absentee ballot rules  Some states allow anyone to vote absentee and do not require a reason. Other states require specific reasons for requesting an absentee ballot — for instance, that you will be absent from the county on election day or are required to work a shift of 10 hours or more that conflicts with polling hours.   However, in light of COVID-19, many of the states that are typically strict about absentee voting are allowing absentee ballots to anyone who requests one. And some states are automatically mailing absentee ballots to every single registered voter.   Check my state’s absentee ballot rules  If you’re in a state where you’ll automatically get a ballot in the mail, make sure your mailing address is correct on your voter registration.   Check my voter registration status  2. How to request an absentee ballot  Before you request a ballot, check your state’s absentee ballot application deadline.  Check my state’s absentee ballot application deadline  Vote.org has a wonderful online resource for requesting an absentee ballot in any state.  Request an absentee ballot  Alternatively, you can also  contact your local election office  for an application, which you can mail, fax, or email back.  3. Your state’s completed absentee ballot deadlines  To count in the election, completed absentee ballots must be received by your state’s deadline. Some states count when the ballot is postmarked, and others count when it is received.  For instance, in Texas, your voted absentee ballot must be postmarked one day before Election Day and received by the day after Election Day. In California it must be postmarked by Election Day and received no later than 17 days after. And in Florida, it doesn’t matter when you send it, but your ballot must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day.  Check my state’s absentee ballot deadlines  4. How to return your absentee ballot  Most people return their voted absentee ballot by mail. But you can also hand-deliver your ballot to a designated location or drop box.  Contact your local election office  to find out where you can return your absentee ballot.      Next step: figure out your voting plan! People with an explicit plan for how they’ll get to the polling place, and at what time, are typically much more successful in voting.

{"prompt":"Lauri’s Story: Money Lessons From Her Mother","completion":" Meet Lauri, a social service worker who lives with her husband and daughter in Dallas, Texas.  Tell me about your job.   I work in social services full-time and I work with individuals who are seeking reemployment. I believe that support has the power to change lives.  What’s your relationship with money?  I’ll be honest with you, I’ve made mistakes with money in the past. I’ve overspent to make myself feel better on the inside. I’d like to think that “comparison is the financial monster that lives in the bank.”   I used to ignore past due debts, not monitor my credit reports, and not look at my bank statements. But when I got older, I made a commitment to be better. My credit score went up by 30 points after I looked at my credit report and found a mistake from five years ago. It really pays to look into those things!  Tell me about how your mom influenced you.  Growing up, I had no clue all the sacrifices she made. She stopped college to take care of me while also working full-time. That was a big sacrifice for sure. At five or six years old, I probably didn’t think about that. She never left our needs to anyone else.  When she was working at Woolworths, she had this vision for herself to work at a bank. At that time, she only had partial college credits, but she wanted to see how far she could go. She eventually applied for a job in the accounting department and got it.  My mom would do simple things that made a big difference. For example, I didn’t realize that we were eating ramen every night because she made the dish look fancy. She’d put the noodle soup in glass bowls and add garnishes like an egg on top. When I got older and went grocery shopping with my mom, I saw how diligent she was with making sure to keep within her budget. She would shop at Aldi’s and I noticed that she would never casually spend her money—she always had a plan.   Even when she became a project manager at a financial investment firm, she still stuck to her budgeting habits. If she got a bonus, she’d put that money in her savings. If she got a raise, she’d keep her spending the same.    “ My mom made the best of whatever we had and made it look as if it were fit for a king and queen. It was only later as a teenager did I realize that I didn’t see her eat often when I was young or only after serving me, and that some of my favorite dishes were made of noodles or eggs and other low cost staples. But she always smiled and She. Always. Found. Money. To. Save.  I grew to respect her hard work and sacrifice so much that I would often ask to thrift for new clothes and skipped asking for senior pictures and trips. I remember being excited to find a dress for senior prom for $20 because it wouldn’t stretch my mom too much. My mom was 19 when I came along, but I am proud to say 40 years later she is a leader in her field of Finance and Technology. She has a bigger budget to work from, but she has the same smile and spirit from when I was five years old eating my mom’s special noodles. ❤️ ”   What did the 2020 holidays look like for you?  I’m a big believer that there is so much value in giving whatever you have—it does not have to be monetary. Everyone appreciates when you give them time and attention. I tried to do cash-only Christmas and not give into “guilt gifting.” Homemade cards go a long way!   How do you feel about SaverLife?  I really like how SaverLife was able to put me in touch with a financial coach! They give me relevant resources to look to for guidance. My financial coach is great. Recently, I was telling her what I’ve been going through and she said, “Don’t be hard on yourself. Introduce a new perspective to your situation.”  Just last week, I was thinking about opening a  529 account  for my 5-year-old daughter, and SaverLife had an article on just that in the  Ask An Expert  section! I love that everything on the website is free.  "}

{"prompt":"Brett’s Story: The Price of Debt","completion":" Meet Brett, a full-time student living in Indiana, Pennsylvania who’s pursuing his PhD degree.   What do you do?  I’m in the second year of my program at Indiana University, pursuing a degree in Literature and Criticism. It’s the study of literature but using theories and criticism to discuss different pieces.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  As a child up through graduating college, I was really not taught much about saving money. My parents were probably bad roles models in that sense. They used credit cards to pay for everything and would only make monthly payments. Goodness knows how much they paid in interest in their lives.  When I got older, it was extremely easy to get credit in the late 80s. Every student in college I knew had three or four credit cards. Every week, there would be someone on the street corner who asked, “Hey want a credit card? You’ll get a free t-shirt!”  Most people I knew had 25% APRs. If you were smart, you paid it off. If you weren’t smart, you made poor decisions. I understood the concept on paying interest and not wanting things to end up costing more than what I paid for them.  What are your lowest and highest financial points?  Probably a few years ago I experienced my lowest point. I had recently left a position in 2016 where my job paid for my food and housing in addition to a nice salary. I had to find a place to live. I did okay for the first couple of months because of severance pay. Once that ended, I was just living off my savings. I went from having a nice savings nest to having nothing.  My financial high point would’ve been the beginning of 2016 when I still had my position. I was doing very well and saving lots of money. I was able to put money in my Roth IRA and SRAs; I felt like I had multiple lines of savings.   Have you found it possible to save since losing that position?  I’m just increasing my debt each semester with my loan check that helps pays for bills. I put that money in my savings, and it pays through the semester. The hope is once I graduate and get a real job, that I could save from there.  I don’t know how one can save when they’re a student. The reality for most is, “How can I save when I should be paying off debt?” Where I am, savings accounts are paying less than what my debt costs.   How did you know where to start saving?  I worked in higher education and it’s a good line of work that offers workshops to help you gain knowledge. Most of my money is saved through TIAA. They were good about offering workshops and one-on-one counseling.   What’s one thing you know about money now that you wish you could tell your 18-year old self?  I knew a girl in college. She and I took a few classes together. I admired her greatly because as she went to school, she was working throughout. She was a dedicated housekeeper who would never go out to eat.  I just can’t imagine living my life so restrictively as I went through college. For me, I’d rather have debt in college and have life experiences than not live. I was able to travel to multiple countries in Europe and Russia. I can’t say that I regret the choices I made when I was in college.  You could end up being 40 with no debt because you sacrificed as a young person, but I don’t know if you’ll be any better off from a life satisfaction standpoint.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It means opportunity. Going somewhere, buying something—it all involves money.   What are your savings goals?  Soon I’ll be applying for a teaching assistantship. If I get it, I’ll be teaching two classes each semester. I’ll be paid $25,000 a year, so I’ll be above the poverty line. If I get the position, I’ll have access to the university’s health insurance, and I won’t have to take out any more loans. Getting this assistantship would open up a lot of opportunities for me and help me build my savings. "}
{"prompt":"Emmanuel’s Story: A North Carolina Dad Invests in His Family’s Future","completion":" Meet Emmanuel, an Applications Analyst at a hospital. He used stimulus payments and savings to pay off debt during the pandemic.  Earlier in life, Emmanuel wasn’t “the best with money.” He didn’t learn about money management when he was growing up and accrued significant credit card debt in his twenties.    The pandemic has been a scary time for many, but in the midst of stay-at-home orders, Emmanuel was able to find a bright spot: saving money.   “I no longer had to drive to work every day, and we cut out unnecessary weekend spending,” he said.   When he turned 30, Emmanuel got serious about personal finance. He lives with his fiance and their children, and he’s committed to teaching their children about money.   “I make it a point to talk to our kids about the power of saving so they won’t learn later on in life like I did,” Emmanuel said.   During the pandemic, Emmanuel and his fiance bought a rental property to create another income stream. Emmanuel put every cent he could toward paying off credit card debt.   “I carried balances like people carry purses,” he said. “I had $30,000 in student loans and my credit card debt was up to almost $30,000.”  Emmanuel found out about SaverLife while surfing the internet looking for financial tools and signed up in March 2021.   “I saw there were scratch-offs and signed up thinking there was a one in a million chance to win,” he said. “I won a week or two later! I’ve won almost $100 through SaverLife.”  Emmanuel also appreciates that SaverLife tracks his saving rate, and he likes seeing how he compares to other members on the leaderboard. He says SaverLife has helped him build his emergency savings account.   “Before, I probably had a month’s worth of my salary saved. Now, I’ve saved a three-month emergency fund,” he said.  Emmanuel recently paid off the last of his credit card debt.  “Now that we’re debt-free, I’m going to transition to more investing,” he said.   "}
{"prompt":"Daisy’s Story: Dreaming of a Purple House with Chickens","completion":" Meet Daisy, a part-time lecturer and breastfeeding peer counselor, living in San Francisco with her 5-year old daughter.  What do you do for a living?  I currently have two jobs and might pick up a third. I lecture a weekly class at San Francisco State University and I also have a part-time job as a breastfeeding peer counselor at the Women, Infants, & Children (WIC), where I work 20 hours a week. Additionally, I’m trying to take up substituting when I’m not watching my daughter to make ends meet.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  My mom had a mindset of save, save, save. However, she didn’t really give us the tools to save and we never actually saw the money – it was behind closed doors. I never knew how much we needed in order to get by. There was a lot of restraint for extracurricular activities, too. I also knew my mom was against credit cards.  When I went to college, my family couldn’t help me out financially. There was essentially no family contribution. I didn’t know what to do. My peers told me, “Don’t worry, you can get a loan.” At the time, I didn’t know the language behind what a loan was. I was the first in my family to get a higher education degree, so I felt like I couldn’t turn to anyone in my family about money for school. We never had those conversations about money.   I applied for my first credit card as an undergraduate. In college, I was more able to manage my credit card because I would never charge my card unless I could pay for things in full. Things changed after I got my master’s degree during the ’08-’09 recession and I had to rely more on my credit card.  Any advice for people looking to be responsible with credit cards?  A while back, I went to get a car when I was unemployed and trying to make it in Los Angeles. What I noticed is that credit is really important for things like this. My good credit score gave me the autonomy to go in and confidently purchase a car. At the same time, my older brother was trying to get a car. But because he had no credit history, he couldn’t get one. I told him he needs build credit to prove to credit companies that he can pay for things.  Credit cards are the pathway to bigger credit. Make sure you have a credit limit AND a personal limit. I feel more at ease when I can pay it off easily.    What are your lowest and highest financial points?  The worst was when I left my daughter’s father. I had no housing. I was unemployed and I carried with me $40,000 student debt from graduate and undergraduate school. Luckily, I had a trusted friend hold some of my savings since my relationship began to show red flags. The cushion allowed me to make the move with my 18 month old at the time  The highest, unfortunately does not seem long lived. But I do try to focus on the short term goals met. I have above a 700 point credit score. I paid off two student loans and now focusing on my third private loan. I have two months of living expenses in my savings and hopefully I can make it three months.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve applied to your life?  “Smart Money Coaching” in San Francisco is a good resource. I was introduced to it at my old job.   Tracking my finances has become really big for me. Now, before I splurge, I log into my bank account and look at what I need to pay off and what I have left. This has really helped me lately. I pause and ask myself, “Do you really need this right now? Can you afford this right now?” It stops me from getting into more debt. Reminding myself about longer term goals has been really helpful in terms of budgeting.   What are your short-term savings goals?  I want to see my private student loan disappear and narrow my student loans down to two.  I also just want to have one job to cover the bills as opposed to having multiple like I do now. It’ll be easier when it comes to my daughter’s care demands as well as affording to pay rent from one stream of income.  What are your goals for the future?  I’d like to own a house. My daughter and I dream of having a purple house with room for chickens in the backyard. We could have fresh eggs. That’s the goal that I strive for. "}
{"prompt":"Cheranda’s Story: Celebrating Sobriety and Achieving her Financial Goals","completion":" Cheranda is an Assistant Operations Manager at a local grocery store in Portland, Oregon.   How have you been?  I’m 42, and this past Monday, I’ve been sober for seven years. In June, I’ll have been at my job for six years. I started off as a prep cook. During the past few years, I got into a home buying program and that’s how I got connected with SaverLife.  I’ve been trying to get sober for a long time. I’ve got six months here, eight months there. But this time I had to detox before going to treatment. I’ll never forget landing in detox and I couldn’t eat or drink and I thought, “I have to change my life. I’m better than this.” It was at that moment that I decided to believe in myself.  Last year, I bought a condo. Before then, I was living in a REACH community development residence. I took a budgeting class there and got an IDA (individual development account) after I completed the course.  Did you learn any money lessons growing up?  I grew up in a foster home, so I didn’t have any money lessons growing up. My sister and I would collect cans for money. To be honest, I got the best financial training in the last three years with the home buying program, budgeting class, and SaverLife.   I grew up in foster care, started drinking when I was ten years old, and have been homeless for most of my life. I got connected with the Portland Housing Center and got into their first-time home buyers program.  What has saving looked like for you?  I needed to save up money to buy a condo. I now also have emergency savings! Right now, I’m looking to buy a car to celebrate seven years sober.  I also always save for SaverLife’s monthly  Race to $100 . Even though I only need to save $100 to be eligible for a cash prize, I like to try and push myself to save more than that.  How has SaverLife helped you?  SaverLife helped me start saving. I appreciate the helpful and informative emails. Everything SaverLife has is helpful actually—the emails,  quizzes ,  articles , text reminders, the  Scratch & Save  cards, and savings incentives. I have a hard time remembering things, so those email and text reminders really help!  I also like reading the  stories  of how other SaverLife members have been able to save.  What financial goals has SaverLife helped you reach? What goals do you plan to use SaverLife to accomplish in the future?   Now that I bought a place of my own, my next long-term goal is to buy a small property on the coast. I love being by the water. Since I joined SaverLife, that goal seems attainable now. I know that if I keep doing what I’m doing I can do that.  I’m proud that I don’t have to finance my car and that I have a mortgage now. Before I got the house, one of my goals was to pay off my debts. I was able to do that and now I’m debt-free.  I’m glad that I have a checking account set up with direct deposit and automatic withdrawals. In order to reach my financial goals, I actually picked up a second job and buckled down on buying things. It was life-changing.  Now I weigh out my options and think differently about whether something I’m about to purchase is a want or a need. There have actually been times where I was going to buy something but then a tip from a SaverLife article would pop into my head and I’d put the item back. The  Money 101 articles  have changed my perspective on money. "}
{"prompt":"Tecoria’s Story: A Lupus Warrior","completion":" Meet Tecoria, a car mechanic and rising poet who lives with her family in Buffalo, South Carolina.   Can you tell me about your jobs?  I work at a mechanic shop with my brother and help however I can. When I’m not working at the car shop, I like to write poetry and post it on Vocal. It’s a place where you can share your work and people can send you money to help fund what you’re doing. I also have my own small business that focuses on healing.   What does a day in your life currently look like?   Because of my lupus, my morning routine can take two to three hours. By the time I make my way to the car shop, I’m fatigued, but I have to be the big sister that my brothers need me to be. And, most importantly, I need to do my job. I’m lucky to have very understanding brothers. They know my situation and help me out in the morning by setting up the space heater at the car shop for me.  When I’m done with my work day, I make flyers for my small business, the car shop, and for my rapper and poetry friends. It brings me a lot of joy to help my friends with marketing and business management.   “I’m thankful for my mom. When I was a teenager with a recent lupus diagnosis, my mom would rush me to the doctor every week, help me manage the medications I was prescribed, and take me to my different surgeries. I saw her cry so many times because she thought lupus would kill me. One day, I came home from a doctor’s appointment upset because the doctor said I wouldn’t live to see 21. But I just celebrated my 28th birthday. My mom is my rock, my queen, and my she-ro. When I can’t move and I’m in pain, she’s by my side. And when I had a total hip replacement, she was right there. I thank her every day and tell her how much I love her!!”   Your mom sounds very supportive. Tell me about her.  She’s always been there for me. She’s a teacher and loves her students as much as she loves her own kids. I know I can call her if I need anything and she’d stop whatever she’s doing to come and help. She was there for me when I was diagnosed with lupus. I actually wrote a poem for her and she said that she’d read it to her students. I want to do more for my mom and provide more for her, but right now I can’t and I don’t know how to make that happen.  How has COVID-19 impacted you?  It’s impacted the car shop because people just aren’t driving as much these days. We haven’t had as much business as we usually do. Also, people just don’t have the money to get their car serviced. I’ve had to work out payment plans with people who have needed work done on their cars.   What would you like to do when things are better?  I want to see the world. I go to Florida all the time and usually take a big trip during the summer, so I’m looking forward to making that happen.  My next international trip will be to Dubai. One of my favorite artists shared a video of Dubai at night when the city was all lit up and I want to experience that for myself.   Are you saving for anything in particular?  Well, I went to the doctor’s the other day and I found out that I was pregnant. I’m going to save up and surprise my mom with a little onesie.   I don’t have financial support from the father, but I know my family and friends will be here for me. My friends tell me, “You don’t need [the father’s] support. You’re so strong.” I have such a positive team behind me.  Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  I’d say my biggest financial achievement is being able to stay caught up on my bills. I got a little behind on my car payment but I’ve been working towards that. Right now, I’m focusing on budgeting for my bills and getting out of debt. I receive a social security disability insurance check each month, so I try to save a little bit but it’s not a lot.  Do you have any student loans you’re paying off?  Yes, I do. I’m on an income-based repayment plan. Because my income recently dropped, my loan provider said that my payments will be paused until May 2021. If my take-home pay increases by then, the loan provider will see if I’m able to pay my loans.   To date, I’ve paid off $80,000 in student loan debt.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I like how SaverLife can keep track of how much I’m spending. I convinced my brother to join SaverLife, too! The Money 101 articles have been very helpful as well. I recently read articles on  how to get out of debt  and  how to buy a house . One of my life goals is to buy a house of my own by the time I turn 30 years old. Once I get to where I want to be in life, I want to give back to my community.  "}

{"prompt":"Megan’s Story: To Value Money Means You Value Yourself","completion":" Meet Megan, an Assistant Supervisor for the Community Housing Partnership in San Francisco.  What do you do at the Community Housing Partnership?  I’m an Assistant Supervisor. I help our volunteer team supervise events and do marketing and partnerships with different programs like the Salvation Army. We work in areas to help prevent our clients from returning to homelessness.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I grew up pretty middle class. My parents worked hard to give us a better life than they had. They tried to focus on savings. I consider myself a lot more fortunate than most people because I’m able to go on vacation.   My dad made a deal with me where he would double the money I received from babysitting if I put it into my savings. That was a good incentive for me.   Any noteworthy money lessons your parents taught you?  Savings was important. My dad used to talk about how money can go really quickly. My parents always gave us money for what we wanted and what we needed. I was very fortunate to get what I needed.  What have been your highest and lowest financial points?  I’ve struggled with homelessness myself. The lowest point was probably when all my money was going to my drug habit. I wasn’t able to save even $5 at a time because it would just go back to my bad habit.  My highest point is right now. I have saved some money right now, but I also do have debt. I believe I have more money now than I’ve ever had in my life.  What’s your advice on saving?  Start saving as young as you can, even if it’s just getting into the habit of saving $25 from every paycheck. If your job has a retirement plan, save there too. Have a savings account that you don’t touch. Once you get into the habit of taking money from your savings, it’s hard to stop.  If you can, put 20% into savings. Have a savings account for rainy day funds or a vacation. Have a goal for your savings. It’s also important to save for emergencies. Reward yourself along the way and do things to acknowledge that you’re saving.   One thing I’m learning is that it’s good to buy food and make it at home. That’s where I could be saving more money. Take time and organize your budget every month. Take time to organize and map out eating 80% of your food at home. This is still something that I still kind of struggle with.   I took for granted growing up with an oven and microwave because now I have a little room and making anything to eat is a huge mess. I’ve gotten too used to the convenience of eating out.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  My father always focused on saving, especially saving for retirement. If you can, take advantage of any savings program that your job has available. Additionally, pay off your credit card bill each month.   What does money mean to you in your life?  Money is a reflection of how a part of me is doing. It’s a very valuable and essential tool. It’s important and it should be respected. I learned the relationship between spending money and how I’m feeling about myself. When I’m feeling good about myself, I’m not spending as much money. When I’m not feeling as well, I might buy things and sometimes end up feeling worse.  What are your savings goals?  I need a surgery that is expensive, and my insurance doesn’t fully cover it.  Also, I would also like to get to a place where I’m making enough income to afford a new apartment that’s located in a safer area. I’m in low-income housing right now. I would like a place with more room, my own bedroom, my own bathroom, my own kitchen. "}
{"prompt":"Jeanette’s Story: Supporting Her Students However She Can","completion":" Meet Jeanette, an academic advisor and college counselor who lives with her two children in the Bronx, New York.   What do you do for work?  I’ve been working as an academic advisor and college counselor for the past 20 years at a college in New York. The COVID-19 pandemic has definitely affected my job. Everything is different. No one comes in for in-person appointments anymore, and we have to wear masks and get our temperature taken every time we go on campus. Before the pandemic, I was working hands-on with students and I had my own office. Technically, I still have my own office, but now I’m working from home. These days, I only go onto campus once a week.  Going virtual has been quite the transition. I realized that a lot of students would rather have that in-person advising and counseling experience. When I was working in the office, I created personal relationships with my students and they’d come in and talk to me all the time. Now we just talk on the phone.   These days, I am counseling students virtually. I believe they’d rather be on campus, but there are still restrictions in place to avoid crowding. This whole situation has been hard on everyone.   I try to keep them focused on their goals and aspirations. I used to have a lot of kids come in and talk for hours at a time. A lot of students have financial issues because they or their parents lost their jobs. And some students are having to deal with personal issues like their grandparents passing away from COVID-19. More than anything, I believe it’s important to remind them that their loved ones wouldn’t want them to give up.  Walk me through a day in your life.  I wake up and roll out of bed, brush my teeth, make some coffee, turn on my computer, help students register for classes, and respond to emails. I have a lot of Zoom calls these days, communicating with my coworkers, supervisors, and students. I always try to reach out to my students whenever I can to let them know that I’m here if they need me.  How do you and your kids deal with virtual school?  My son is in 8th grade and does his work in the living room, and my daughter is in 11th grade and does her work in her own room. On a daily basis, I just make sure they wake up in time for class, ensure their laptops are on, and check on them every so often see if they’re listening to their lectures. In the last couple of months, I’ve really gotten a chance to connect even more with my children since we’re all working and going to school from home.  Tell me about your side hustle(s).  Prior to March 2020, I was driving for UberEats and Instacart. When the pandemic hit, I didn’t want to risk my health or the health of my family. I knew I had to find something different. I got my license to be an insurance advisor and also started helping my friend and her management company. I’m her assistant and she pays me twice a month. I’m a representative for Total Life Changes, so I help sell health products. In addition to all that, I do paid surveys and focus groups when I can. Whenever I get extra money from those things, I put it toward my emergency fund.   My son sometimes works with me on my side hustles. I’m teaching him how to be responsible. He takes half of what he earns and puts that money in his own savings account.    I have automatic transfers to my accounts on a monthly basis. I have the Acorns app for my retirement, investments, and accounts for my children. I also transfer allowance to my children’s savings account, insurance, and emergency funds. I pay myself first. Coming from a childhood where my mother didn’t teach me about saving money, I think I’ve done a good job with my own children.   How do you like to plan out paying your bills?  When I got a divorce a couple of years ago, I was left in a bad financial situation. I had a lot of credit card debt at that time.That’s when I started doing extra jobs to supplement my income. I took a class on financial literacy and financial freedom that really helped me.  From there, I used a budget book to help me keep track of my expenses. I labeled the due dates of the bills and in order to prevent not paying each bill, I set up automatic bill payments. I learned my lesson from the number of times I forgot to pay the bills and had to call the company to beg them not to charge any additional fees.   Tell me more about your childhood and money.  My mother didn’t have much when I was growing up, so when I got older, I realized that I wanted a better life for my children. I want to teach them what I didn’t know. In watching my mother struggle, I realized how important it was to get a good education. To me, education was the key to an independent, financially stable life. I accumulated $15,000 in student loans by the time I graduated college and made sure to pay it off right away. As soon as I got my tax refund, I would put every penny toward paying down my debt. Of course, this was before I had kids so I could afford to pay off my debt like that. When I got older and landed a job at the college where I earned my Bachelor’s degree, I was fortunate enough that the college paid for my Master’s.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I discovered SaverLife through the Budgetnista’s Facebook group,  DreamCatchers. I’ve given so many resources from SaverLife to my students. There’s also a lot of  COVID-19 resources  for food, help with paying rent, and more. A lot of my students are SaverLife members, too.   I like the  savings challenges , different ways to  earn points  while learning, and  Scratch & Save cards . I won $5 once!  SaverLife also introduced me to  FindHelp.org , which has helped many of my students find resources they need. "}
{"prompt":"How do you deal with ups and downs in income?","completion":"It’s in the news all the time: a  record number of Americans  have incomes that go up and down throughout the year. Some of these people work in the “gig economy,” driving for rideshare services like Lyft and Uber; some work seasonal construction jobs; and some perform childcare or freelance work when they can get it.  EARN’s research shows that SaverLife members have fluctuating incomes as well:  70% of Savers experience income volatility.  When you don’t know what your income is going to be every month, that can make it hard to plan and hard to save. We asked some of you: how do you deal with ups and downs in your income?  How Savers manage in times of lower income   Gabriella, a Saver from California, told us, “In a low period of income, we count on my girls or borrow from my parents. In a high period, we set aside money as savings, but something always comes up and we have to use it.” "}
{"prompt":"A DC Saver Uses SaverLife to Reduce Debt and Build Savings","completion":" Meet Naomi, a nonprofit employee living in the Washington D.C. area and using SaverLife to save.  Naomi didn’t learn much about money management when she was growing up. A few years ago, after surviving serious medical issues and parting ways with her husband, she decided to take control of her finances.   Naomi’s goal this year is to get out of debt. When she found out about SaverLife, she decided to take the opportunity to build her financial knowledge.  “For the past couple of decades, I haven’t had a savings account,” Naomi explained. “SaverLife encouraged me to open one and get more disciplined about saving—especially because of the savings match program.”   In the few months since joining SaverLife, Naomi has committed to saving at least $40 a month. She also called her lenders to set up repayment plans for her debts, something she learned about from SaverLife’s financial coaches. One of her biggest financial goals is to save up money to buy a sewing machine.     “A sewing machine will help me create a new revenue stream,” she said. “Right now, I’m saving towards purchases that will help me increase my income.”  Naomi hopes to use this additional income to help her pay off debt and build investments so she can leave something behind for her three adult children.

{"prompt":"Felicia’s Story: Can’t Spend It If You Can’t See It","completion":" Meet Felicia*, an Administrative Assistant who lives with her boyfriend in Massachusetts.  What’s your home life like?  My boyfriend and I are currently renting an apartment together. It’s been really good! We both have similar working hours, and we get to sleep at the same time.   What do you do?  I’m currently an Administrative Assistant. You could say I’m a career changer, actually. I got my Master’s degree in teaching originally, and as I was looking for a full-time job, I landed this admin role. I like the job itself and especially the people. The only thing I don’t like is the pay.  What did your childhood teach you about finances?  My parents are immigrants, so they didn’t earn a lot. Anytime they got money, they would save it. I definitely learned how to save from watching my parents do it.  They were actually really good at saving, but they didn’t know the difference between a checking account and a savings account, so they were just kind of putting it somewhere.   I feel like I save, but not as much as they did. I don’t have kids to take care of or a house, but I definitely try to save and I budget every week.  What does a week of budgeting look like?  My main expenses are food, groceries, and eating out, rent (monthly), and transportation (monthly).  What’s been a time in your life that you’ve felt most financially secure?  I think it was when I was little because I didn’t have a concept of money. Also, when I got my first full-time job, I had a bit more income coming in.  How did you manage the income from your first job?  It was the first time that money was consistently coming in. It was more income than I was used to, so I knew that I had to be diligent with how I spent it. At the end of paying all my bills, whatever I had left was for fun. I was very cognizant of my recurring expenses.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  It’d probably be to save your money before you spend it. You’ll get accustomed to saving that amount and only spending what is left over. For example, I set aside 3% of my paycheck every pay period, and that’s money that I just don’t look at.  What’s one thing you know about money now that you wish you knew when you were younger?  I wish that I knew more about high yield savings accounts and investing.  While I don’t know that much about investing, I do know that compound interest is good. I’ve played around with some online calculators and seen how my money could grow over time if invested.  I only wish my parents knew about investing because they could have doubled their money.  YouTube has definitely been helpful. I’m more of a visual learner, so videos help keep me both engaged and informed.  What does financial stability look like to you?  I’d like to get to a point where my boyfriend and I don’t have to consciously budget. Maybe that looks like taking a spontaneous weekend vacation. Or if we had an unexpected expense, it wouldn’t be a big deal because we could afford to pay for it and not go into debt.  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money means fun, freedom, and less stress. If you have money, you may feel less stressed and you can have better control of your time. If you have the funds, you don’t have to be constantly searching for good deals like red eye flights.   What are your thoughts about SaverLife?  I think it’s really cool that savings can be gamified! The digital scratch card I earn weekly is very motivating. I look forward to that email every week. It makes me want to build upon the savings each week and not deplete my paycheck.  I think I’ve won Scratch & Save at least twice. My boyfriend also participates in SaverLife savings challenges and might actually like it even more than I already do!   Anything you’re saving for in particular?  In the short-term, a vacation to Iceland with my boyfriend is definitely on the list! We’ve been talking about going there for so long.   I also have a retirement account, and a certain amount from each paycheck is automatically set aside via direct deposit into that 401(k).   Eventually I want to get a house, but houses here are really pricey. I’m definitely open to moving though if that means buying a house for a more reasonable amount.  *The name of the person in this article has been changed at their request. "}

{"prompt":"Back-to-School Season Looks Different This Year","completion":" August is typically when kids get excited about seeing their classmates again and parents can’t wait to have them out of their hair. But this year’s back to school season looks different. This past June, we asked our members if they were planning to send their children back to school this fall.  A little over half said yes, though a significant number were still unsure. School districts are rapidly adjusting to the changing state of reopening policies. Many are figuring out if distance learning is an option, according to this  NPR article . What does your 2020-21 school year look like?  For people who know their children’s schools will reopen, are you planning to send your children back to school in the fall?   “I work in the school system and I think we should wait awhile longer. The kids are going to have a hard time keeping a mask on all day. I spoke to a few parents and they said they’re not letting their kids come back if it does open in September.” –  Natalie E.  “I think that the school needs to stay closed because the covid19 is still going on this planet. I saw on the news that a kid got sick on the first day of the school day. school should not be open sooner like this because is still not safe at all. I can’t let my son go to school during this COVID 19 because it can affect him at school while other kids are around. I put my family safety first.” –  April J.  “I am sending mine back. There are just some things they can’t do from home.” –  S haron V. "}
{"prompt":"Lauren’s Story: Money Won’t Make You Happy","completion":" Meet Lauren, a mother of four daughters (including a two-month-old baby!) who lives with her husband in Conway, South Carolina.  What do you and your husband do?  My husband is a produce manager at our neighborhood market. I am current filing for disability.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  Money doesn’t grow on trees. I wish it did, but it doesn’t. You have to work hard for everything you want in life.  I had to work for everything I’ve gotten in my life. I was a hard worker. Even as a 13-year-old, I started a babysitting service, and by 16 I was cleaning houses.  What are your highest and lowest financial points?  My highest was when I was working like crazy  – a day job, a night job, and a weekend job, right after high school.  At my lowest, I was living on the streets. I never want to go back to that. It happened because I’m a very friendly person, and I believe in everyone.  How did you get out of that situation?  I got out of homelessness by moving back in with my dad, then I got tired of that and went to Job Corps. I didn’t end up doing anything with that degree, business occupational skills.  But then I did what I said I’d never do – I got pregnant, got married to some idiot, then he put a knife to my throat. Twenty years later, he overdosed. But by that point he was out of my life.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  When you get a nice chunk of money, don’t blow it. Put some aside, save it. Out of every little amount you get, if you put a bit away, it’ll add up. Don’t mess with it, save it for the rainy days or the moment when you don’t have anything. They come rapidly.  Three of Lauren’s four daughters relax after a day at the pool.  What are your goals for the future?  My goal is to keep my house because on April 2 we closed on our first house, and then April 6 I had my daughter. Things always happen in triples, and the third thing was that my daughter’s birth had some complications.  I want to raise my daughters well, with love and the church. And I need to finally get my disability, because it’s been taking forever.  What does money mean to you in your life?  Not much, it’s just a dollar. Money won’t make you happy. It will for a moment, but if you didn’t have money, you could still be happy, as long as you’ve got love and family and friends. "}
{"prompt":"Kiara’s Story: Maybe Money Can’t Buy Happiness, But It Can Buy Security","completion":" Meet Kiara, who lives in Taylor, Michigan with her 11-month-old daughter and her two young cousins.  What do you do?  I don’t have a job. I take care of my daughter and my two cousins because I have a kinship guardianship for them.  One is my biological cousin and the other is his half-brother. Their grandmother, who had adopted them, passed away March 2017. Originally I had only the older one, but then the person who was taking care of the younger one couldn’t take care of him anymore, so I ended up taking care of both of them. Right now they are 7 and 11.   I want to start doing some work from home, but I can’t do things on the phone right now because of the baby.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I had an upper-middle class upbringing. My parents had really good jobs and rainy-day funds and savings. They both worked for the auto industry.  They taught me that it’s important to create a savings nest egg, but I haven’t had the same opportunities that they had to create that.  What’s the highest financial point of your life?  The highest was in 2009. I moved to Alabama, I had a job that paid a lot more, and I didn’t have credit cards or much financial responsibility. I was doing really well financially.  What’s the lowest financial point of your life?  My lowest point began around 2013. I had a decline in health, which led to me being out of work for a while. I had long-term disability, and then eventually social security disability.  Now is one of my lowest points. I wasn’t prepared to have children when I started taking care of my cousins. For the first three months of guardianship, you don’t receive any financial support. But I still had to buy them beds and clothes. I just had to make it work.  Now I’m working with a consolidation company to get my finances back in order.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  If you can’t afford to buy it, don’t get it. Credit gives you a false idea of setting up a goal. You think, “I’ll start out with this low interest, then I can pay it off.” It sets you up for failure.  It’s okay to have a credit card, but you need to only use it when you know you can pay it off.  What are your goals for the future?  I just want to get a new financial start. I want to be able to save for my cousins and daughter so that when they start off in life, they’re not in the same situation I’m in.   I want to be able to have savings for my daughter, even if she doesn’t go to college, so that she can go into adulthood with a little bit of money.  What do you want to teach your daughter about money?   I want to teach her the things I wish I had known. Education is important, but it’s not worth it to go to college and put yourself in $40,000 or $50,000 of debt just to fit into what society wants from you. A lot of trade schools can get you jobs that pay just as well or better, like being an electrician, as what you could do with a degree from college.  I was always an Honor Roll student, but I didn’t like school. My first year out of high school, I started working. I had two jobs and was happy with that. But people talked down to me, so I went to school and it wasn’t a good fit for me. I didn’t finish and now I have these loans that I still haven’t paid off. I wish someone had told me that I didn’t have to do that.  What does money mean to you in your life?  I know people say you can’t buy happiness, but money would mean happiness to me because opportunities are presented. Knowing you’re secure brings happiness. I would say money brings happiness. "}

{"prompt":"Fabiola’s Story: Achieving the American Dream","completion":"    Meet Fabiola, the Grand Prize Winner of our annual SaverLife  Tax Time Story Contest . While the SaverLife team didn’t get to congratulate her in person, we met her over Zoom!  Tell us a little bit about yourself.  I was born in Peru and my first language is Spanish.I came to the United States in 2012 with my parents and brother when I was 18 years old. My first American dream was to go to high school, but unfortunately, I was not accepted because I was too old to enroll. So I decided to go to the Altos Church at night to learn English.   My parents divorced a year after we moved here, so my brother went to live with my mother in a different city and my father got his own place. I decided to move out and live by myself. I worked full-time and learned English, but I was working a minimum wage job that paid $6.50 an hour, so I had to work many hours. According to the managers, I couldn’t be paid more because I didn’t speak English or have enough job experience. Sometimes I didn’t have money to eat or pay my bills.  So you lived by yourself a year after you moved to the United States?  Yes, it was hard. After living alone and working long hours, I learned that I needed to save money. Everybody should save for their future goals or financial emergencies. Once I opened my first emergency savings account in 2019, I started saving $1, $5, $10, or $20 a week. Every dollar counted.   What kinds of jobs did you have when you started working full-time?   It was mostly in the fast food industry. Once, when I was applying for a job, they told me, “Don’t apply here. We’re not hiring Spanish people. This company hires just white people.”   I said, “Okay. Okay, that’s fine.”  On another occasion, I tried applying for a cashier role at the same fast food restaurant because I wanted to gain experience working in the front of the establishment. The manager told me, “No, because you are Spanish, you have to work in the kitchen.” I quit because I didn’t like how racist the manager was.  You said you took night classes at a church. What was that like?  All the adults at the class spoke Spanish with one another, and I knew I wanted to learn English, so I started teaching myself at home. I tried saving money to pay for classes at Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA). It was $600 per class. I said to myself, “Okay, I’ll start there. Maybe I can learn something that will help me get a better job.” So I saved my money and paid for the class. After I finished that one course, I realized that I would have to work another year to afford my next class. At that point, I didn’t realize that I could apply for FAFSA or federal financial aid.  In 2017, I tried applying for financial aid. After three semesters at college, I landed on Business Administration as my major. Now, I’m planning on attending George Mason University and earning my degree in Accounting. I love numbers and enjoy the classes. The next step is to earn my CPA. That’s my end goal. I want to help people with more than just their taxes. I’d like to work with the administration or accounting department of construction companies.   Tell me about your experience saving for college and applying for FAFSA.  When I moved by myself in 2012, I opened my first savings account. I started saving, but it was just enough to pay for classes. College is very expensive. Fortunately, FAFSA helped me pay for my other classes and books. I reduced my hours at work so I could go to school full-time. I discovered that you receive the most federal financial aid when you’re going to college full-time. If reducing how much I worked and going to college full-time meant a better job in the future, then it was worth it.   Where are you working now?  I do part-time front desk work at a primary care facility. Most of the patients are Spanish, so I can help them through the payment process. While it’s not a free clinic, it’s cheap for a private facility, which is good because a majority of the patients are low-income. I try to help everyone I can because when I was in their shoes, nobody wanted to help me.   Have you had your hours reduced at work because of the lockdowns?  Yes. The clinic has been closed since March because the owner is considered high-risk and also doesn’t want to spread the virus. She’ll still take a few patients here and there.   When COVID happened, I had to take some money out of my savings account to pay my bills and whatnot. I was saving for a financial emergency, and that’s what I used it for.   What was it like to find out that you won the $5,000 grand prize on TV?   I thought there were going to be other finalists there. The news people handed me a microphone and an in-ear headset and that’s when I got so nervous I started shaking. Before I knew it, someone from the SaverLife team announced that I had won the $5,000 grand prize while the film crew recorded my reaction. I was just in shock! When I went home later that day, I drank some chamomile tea to calm myself down.  Do you have any plans for the $5,000?  I’m saving it for my college tuition. I want to take fewer loans out and pay for my education out of pocket. That’s my main goal.  What sparked your interest in numbers as a kid?   When I was much younger, I traveled to participate in different math competitions against other students. Both my parents are engineers by trade, so that’s why I have such a strong interest in working with numbers.  Did you learn about money growing up?  My parents didn’t teach me too much about money. I learned about money through my college studies. I didn’t learn about needing to save for emergencies until I came to the United States.  What’s been a high point for you in saving money?   Being able to pay everything on time has been a high point for me. I never pay late. Opening a savings account has been able to help me with this. I know that even in times when I may not have a job, I’ll still be able to afford to pay bills. I feel more empowered. There’s this kind of power you feel when you’ve built up your savings.   My life’s changed since September 2019. Before joining the savings challenges on SaverLife, I was saving just $5, $10, or $20 at a time. The savings challenges like Race to $100 and  Scratch & Save  have pushed me to save more. And even if I don’t win the challenges that week or month, it’s still good for me because I saved money.   How did you find out about SaverLife?  About two semesters ago, one of my professors introduced me to SaverLife and linked an article from the  Money 101 section . I haven’t taken another one of her classes since signing up for SaverLife, but I want to thank her for introducing it to me. I signed up and linked my bank account on the same day after reading reviews from people who said they enjoyed the website.   I saved about $4,000 total since joining!  What’s your favorite thing about SaverLife?   I like reading the investment articles in the Money 101 section. I started reading those articles because I like everything about accounting and think long-term investing is good. Unlike other site’s articles, SaverLife articles aren’t long and boring. They’re short, sweet, and informational.  I also told my friends about SaverLife. I explained that the website has articles about investment, retirement, and COVID resources. "}
{"prompt":"Maria’s Story: $100 Saved from Every Paycheck","completion":" Meet Maria, a social worker assistant with Tribal Child Protective Services. She lives with her husband and three daughters in Phoenix, Arizona.  What do you do?  My husband is a construction worker and I’m a social worker assistant with Tribal CPS. I enjoy being able to work with kids and help them through problems.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I remember growing up, my mom and dad struggled. When I became a grown-up, I wanted to make sure I wasn’t in those kinds of hardships. Ever since I got my first job, I’ve put away at least $100 from every paycheck in case of emergencies.  Sometimes it was tough for my parents. They worked in agriculture in California, so it was seasonal work. Sometimes there wasn’t work, so they had to be wise with money. We always had enough to pay our bills and get food. But sometimes we had to delay paying for clothes or extracurricular activities until they were working again based on the season.  What are the highest and lowest financial points in your life?  My highest was when I was able to save my whole check and just rely on my husband’s paycheck for our expenses.  The worst was when we had to rely on credit cards because my husband’s work slowed down. That’s what we’re currently trying to get out of now. It feels really good right now to be getting out of this debt. This is an important lesson that we’ve learned from and are able to pass down to our kids.   What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  One of my aunts taught me how to manage my money. After we got into this problem, she taught me how to save and pay off our debt more quickly.  We sat down and looked at my husband’s income and my income. We figured out how much we could put aside and how much we could spend until we were able to get this situation sorted out.  What are your goals for the future?  I want to have a good savings account for my daughters for their schooling and I want to continue to be financially stable. My oldest daughter wants to work with computers and my 13-year-old wants to be a teacher.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It’s important to me to keep what we have saved. If I was to get a really good deal on a credit card right now, I would turn it down. I know I don’t need that credit card just to buy superficial things. "}

{"prompt":"David’s Story: Only the Essentials","completion":" Meet David, a construction worker who lives with his wife and 11-year-old son in Safford, Arizona.  What’s it like living in your town?   I’ve lived in Safford for 12 years now. Before then, I used to live in Iowa, then Virginia, and then Seattle. Seattle was the best place. I was in the army there.  What’s your profession?  Before I was a maintenance guy, I served in the Army as an electronic device specialist. I’d fix all the equipment, from radios to flashlights. That’s what I did from 1980 to 1983.  Now, I’m a maintenance guy who works for a lady who owns 30 properties. I do everything from remodeling trailers to putting roofs on apartments to painting. Things have been slowing down because everyone is staying home now due to coronavirus. Work is hard right now because one of the guys I count on is in quarantine right now, and I need him to fulfill his work before I get started on the next step. He was exposed to a family member of his who was symptomatic, so he hasn’t been able to work for the past few weeks. I get $15 an hour, and my boss tries to keep me busy, but it doesn’t always work out. What’s nice about work right now is that 12 of her properties are located really close to me, so I don’t have to go too far for work.   That’s been especially nice these days because I’m driving on bald tires. I was going to get new tires as soon as I could afford them, but then all the shelter in place mandates went into effect and the shops closed. The new tires were going to cost me $600 anyway, which is about a month’s worth of work.  What does a day in your life currently look like during the coronavirus shelter-in-place?   Before the world kind of shut down, I would get up and start on whatever project I had at 8am and work until 4pm.   Nowadays, I haven’t been working much, and everyone is more on edge. I have a lot of work ahead of me fixing apartments and trailers, but nothing’s happening because my colleague is still quarantining.  Are you struggling to pay for essentials now that you haven’t been able to work as much?  Right now, I’m worried about paying rent. Thankfully, my landlord hasn’t kicked me and my family out yet. I feel there’s a lot more pressure on me to provide for my family than there was even a month ago.  I’m grateful I’m able to pay for things like the internet though. I’m a month behind, but the company still keeps the internet on because I can still pay for it even if it is a little late. It’s been like this for a year now where I’ve been a month behind on paying for the internet. I’ve only ever had the internet shut down once when I was two months behind in paying for it.  How do your bills compare to your income these days?  Compared to two months ago, I haven’t been able to pay things in full. The rent and electricity are both in one bill, and gas is another bill, but I haven’t been able to pay for either.   How is your son dealing with school at home?  My 10-year-old son just started doing homeschooling this January even before other kids started distance learning. This is because he used to have a teacher that bullied him. Can you imagine that? A teacher bullying their own student. We tried moving him to another school, but it didn’t get much better. That’s when my wife and I decided to just homeschool him instead. My wife now teaches him while I’m at work.  What will you do with your stimulus check if you receive it?  I could pay the rent if we ever got the stimulus check. That would really help. I did my income taxes last year, but unemployment really messed me up, so I’m not sure I’ll even get it.   Before I was a maintenance guy, I used to work at McDonalds. I started at $7.85 an hour and worked my way up to earning $8-$10. New management came in and they treated me so bad that they essentially forced me to quit. I think they did that so they wouldn’t have to pay for the unemployment if they had let me go. The new managers knew that I was the maintenance guy, and yet they made me do things like scrub the kitchen. With the old owners, I’d take my lunch break to drop my wife off at her job because she had the better paying job, and also drop my son off at my mom’s house so she could watch him while my wife and I were both at work.   When I was forced to quit, I filed for employment. Honestly, I didn’t think I’d get it because I had quit. The whole process to start getting benefits took me a month and a half, and I was only on it for five months before I got the job that I have now. After going to court back and forth with my former employer, the state of Arizona decided I owed the state back $5,000 from the unemployment benefits I received.   Now I earn money under the table with the job that I have, but honestly, I’d rather pay taxes so that I can get a refund.  What do you envision your family’s future?  At the very least, I want to be able to afford things again.  Three years ago, a neighbor’s trailer caught on fire, and embers flew to our home and caused it to go up in flames. My truck didn’t make it either. My family and I lost everything, and all that we had was the clothes we were wearing. The city wanted us to clean the burned trailer up, and I didn’t really have the means to do that, but I had to.  When I owned my own property, I didn’t have to pay rent. Now, we’re paying rent because we’re renting a new trailer. It’s been a heck of a couple of years.   What does money mean to you in your life?  It doesn’t mean much at all. I spend most of what I earn for my family, not myself. I don’t make very much as it is because I only work about 30 hours a week.   How do you find out about SaverLife?  I found you guys on the Fresh EBT app and decided to see what it was about.  "}
{"prompt":"Michael’s Story: Make Your Money Work For You","completion":" Meet Michael, a substance abuse counselor who lives in San Diego, California.  What do you do?  I’m a substance abuse counselor. I’ve been doing it for about two years now – midlife career change. Unfortunately, it’s one of the fastest growing professions in the US, which doesn’t bode well for us.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I’m 48, and I came from a traditional family. My father worked all the time, and my mother balanced our household budget. She was good at making the budget go further and managing money.  We’re second-generation immigrants from Germany, and I learned the value of working hard from my grandparents. Spending money well, as well as saving money, was instilled in me from an early age.  One thing I see a lot is when people get a raise or get a better job, then they increase their standard of living and become more debt-ridden. I learned not to do that, and stay below my means. There are always unexpected car repairs and medical expenses.  What’s your lowest financial point?  At my lowest point, I was pretty much destitute. There was a period when that unfortunately happened. I’ve been there, and I’m lucky that it was brief. I had gone against everything I learned, went heavily into debt, and wasn’t able to make ends meet.  How did you make a change?  I had to reframe everything. I had to look at all the situations in my life and make a plan for how to get out of it. Even when I had the money to move into a nicer place or get a new car, I didn’t do that. It enabled me to save money so that I would never go through that situation again.  The main thing I’ve learned about is consumer debt. Credit cards, car loans – I limit myself to the absolute minimum. When I’m offered a high-limit credit card line, I don’t take it. You start to think of it as free money, but then you have to pay it back with tremendous interest!  It’s good to have a credit card in case of emergency. Don’t use them for vacations or shopping sprees. Because it’s not your money! That’s been my biggest breakthrough.  Now I take 10% of my paycheck and I pay myself first. Then I pay all my bills. You work hard, so you need to make sure you take some of that money goes to the things you want.  What’s your highest financial point?  I consider myself at a high point right now. I’m lucky to have savings and money for investing. However small, it’s there and it’s a luxury. It’s a blessing to have that. I treat the money with a lot more respect nowadays than I did previously. I think that comes with my age and wisdom from past experiences.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Pay yourself first – take 10% of every paycheck regardless. And avoid the consumer credit traps.  It’s real simple, real profound, and it really works.  What are your goals for the future?  I want to continue saving money and have money for a down payment on a house in the next two years. That’s my initial goal.  Then I want to continue saving money and start reinvesting money. I used to be an avid investor, and I want to get back into that game at a conservative level. I’m too old to start taking silly risks, investing in risky start-ups or IPOs. I might as well go to the casino at that point!  What does money mean to you in your life?  Money is not the answer to everything, but it’s necessary. It has to be earned, and then it has to be respected. You work for your money, and it should work for you. That’s saving or investing.  We’re in a society where money is 100% necessary. We have to respect what it does and what it can do for us. "}
{"prompt":"Meet Deirdre: A Mom of Six Saving for a Secure Future","completion":" Deirdre works in the data department at the University of Vermont Medical Center. She was selected as one of our 2020 Super Saver of the Year finalists.  Deirdre didn’t plan on being a foster parent. But several years ago, an urgent circumstance arose with one of her coworkers, and she and her husband jumped in to take on a temporary child placement. They’ve since adopted two children they’ve fostered, bringing them to a grand total of six kids.   She didn’t start out as a great saver, and with six children, setting aside money was difficult.   “Every year when we thought we were going to be able to save we either added another child to the mix or something happened with my husband’s job,” Deirdre said.   Deirdre’s savings journey changed when her employer, the University of Vermont Medical Center, introduced her to SaverLife as one of their  wellness incentives . She learned about a SaverLife match program that gave people $60 for saving $20 for six consecutive months.   “Save money and get paid to do it?” she thought. “That’s a no brainer.”   Deirdre completed the first challenge and became an active SaverLife member. She particularly enjoys the articles with financial tips.   “ They’re easy reads ,” she said. “It’s a lot of bang for your buck.”  Before joining SaverLife, Deirdre said the family had very little savings.  Since joining, she’s put away $5,000 in their savings account . Having that rainy day fund has been crucial to teach her children about saving and provide some security for the family. It was a crucial cushion when her husband was laid off from his job in 2020.   SaverLife has taught Deirdre that saving doesn’t have to be difficult.   “It’s easier than I thought to set $20 aside,” she said.   In December 2020, Deirdre was a finalist for our  Super Saver of the Year competition  and won $1,000. She plans to use some of the money to buy Christmas presents for the kids, and they were taking a family vote on a charity to donate some of the funds to. Deirdre also hopes to use some of the money to save for building an addition to their house.   “I can’t say we were planning on having six children,” she said. “We’ve outgrown our small house and have been planning for what feels like years now to do an addition.”   However, Deirdre is committed to tucking money away using SaverLife so they won’t have to borrow as much to complete the addition.   “You only gain in the end,” she said. “Even if you save the money and don’t win the challenge you’ve saved the money.” "}

{"prompt":"Monica’s Story: Reaching Out to her Community","completion":" Meet Monica, an Outreach Specialist who lives with her three children in San Francisco.   How’s your family holding up with all the COVID-19 restrictions?  My youngest daughter just graduated from high school this summer and she’s attending City College of San Francisco. All her classes are on Zoom, which is very different for a lot of students. My oldest daughter was accepted into Columbia University and she’s earning her PhD there. However, she hasn’t been able to move out to New York because of all the restrictions. My two boys are in high school and 4th grade, and they’re both doing school virtually as well. This pandemic has been really tough on my kids.  Tell me more about your job.   I was very fortunate to get a job with the San Francisco Parks & Recreation Department right as the pandemic started. For all the new hires and volunteers, we’ve been doing job training online. That part’s been tough because I’m so used to working with people face-to-face. I’m taking as many training sessions as I possibly can to help me use the technology.  During our  November to Remember initiative , you mentioned that your side hustle was COVID-19 community event planning. What does this look like?  I originally got started with COVID-19 community event planning since my previous part-time jobs were closed due to public health precautions. I was working in the cosmetology and massage therapy field. Additionally, I also worked with a local union to set up shows, greet vendors, and help get their tents set up. From personal experience, I know that hospitality jobs have been hit really hard during this pandemic. In San Francisco, we’re starting to close certain indoor establishments like restaurants, museums, and gyms again.  Fortunately, I still have family and friends that are willing to host small gatherings, which is where I come in to help. Early on during the pandemic, I was dispatched as a Disaster Service Worker (DSW) with the San Francisco Parks & Recreation Department. I learned about best practices for when it comes to physical distancing. These days, I’ve been focused on giving people advice for safely hosting, like graduation drive-bys and zoom birthday celebrations.  I’ve even helped with some in-person events as well, but they’re a little more challenging right now. Even though we say people need to stay six feet away from one another, that’s tough when it comes to things like passing food. In the event that someone is willing to host a small in-person event, I help make sure that the spaces have hand washing stations and everyone has a PPE pack that consists of things like hand sanitizer and a mask. With backyard parties, the public health department recommends keeping them to shorter periods and not having more than 12 people in attendance. The tougher holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming up and we’re working with communities to make sure that everyone can celebrate safely.  Speaking of the holiday season, what does that look like for your family this year?   Here in San Francisco, we just got a notification advising against travel unless it’s essential. My goddaughter offered to come to the city and cook for my family so I could warm it up the day of Thanksgiving and she’d make the same meal for her family. That way, we could celebrate Thanksgiving over Zoom and it would be like we’re having the meal together even though we’re physically apart. The public health department is also advising that no one should be near anybody that’s not in their household.   For Christmas, my kids and I were thinking about having a theme for every room in our apartment. For example, my son would have a Thomas the Train theme, another room would have a Grinch theme, my daughter’s room would have a Nightmare Before Christmas theme, and our living room would have a traditional Christmas theme. We’re very excited about potentially getting a blow-up tree from Party City instead of a regular tree this year. It’s low maintenance, which I like, and something we’ve never tried before, which my kids like!   How do you feel about your financial situation?  I’ll be lucky to have earned $50,000 by the end of the year. I was deployed as a Disaster Service Worker (DSW) with the San Francisco Parks & Recreation Department this past spring, and two months into my job, I was hired on as the Community Development Outreach Specialist. I know I’m very fortunate to be earning income when so many people are struggling to find a job. But with my kids being home more, I feel like I’m spending a lot more money on things like food. I didn’t realize how much I depended on them having lunch at school. It’s tough not to overeat when you’re home for so long. I spend most of my money on things like food, school supplies for my son, and getting my car fixed since it broke down recently. We also had to buy a loft for my daughter so she could have a place of her own to study while she starts her PhD program at Columbia. Since the pandemic, she hasn’t been able to go there in person.   We live in federal subsidized housing and our rent actually increased. Pre-pandemic, I had a savings plan in place, but when the rent increased, it threw me off. For a while, I didn’t know how I was going to save money. Even now I’m still figuring it out.   I’d feel better if I could work part-time doing conventions or cosmetology work, but I just don’t know when opportunities like that will open up again. For now, we have to stay as strict with our budget as we can. The line for the Marin Food Bank is so long nowadays that we have to make an appointment ahead of time. The food bank used to be set up like an open farmers market where you could pick what you wanted, but now the volunteers just put pre-packed bags of food in your car.   What would you like to do after this is all over?  Prior to the pandemic, my kids and I had been talking about spending Christmas in Hawaii for what seems like forever. We’re all huge Disney fans and have dreamed about staying at the Disney resort, Aulani, on the island of Oahu. We just really want to have a vacation to get away from everything that’s going on.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I’ve been a SaverLife member since the mid-2000s when it was  formerly known as EARN . I really like the  savings challenges  the organization offers as well as the  helpful articles . I know I can trust what’s been published.  "}
{"prompt":"Week 4 Debt Quiz Results","completion":" Here are the results from our fourth holiday savings quiz! Scroll through to see what members answered and  take the quiz yourself .  1. I pay off my credit card balances every month.   Paying off your credit card debt every month can save you hundreds—or in some cases thousands—of dollars in interest. This interest you are paying is extra money you are giving to a credit card company, helping the corporation become financially stable instead of yourself.  2. I have a written plan to pay off my debts.   As the saying goes, “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.” Having a plan to pay off debt helps you prioritize your spending and helps to keep you focused. For tips on paying off debt, read  What’s The Best Way To Pay Off Debt?  3. I know exactly how much debt I have and my interest rates.   You cannot control what you do not measure. The first step to paying off your debts is to do an inventory of your debts, the amounts you owe, payments, and your interest rate. If you’ve consistently been making on-time payments, consider calling and asking your creditor to lower your interest rate.  4. My debt is manageable.   Ideally, you should be able to pay off your credit cards monthly. If you are carrying a balance, and it’s not due to a drop in income, it may be a sign that you are living beyond your means. If you struggle to pay your debt’s minimum it’s definitely a sign that your debts are unmanageable. Consider reviewing the blog  What’s the best way to pay off debt  to create a debt payoff plan.  5. I feel confident that I can pay off my debts.   If you do not feel confident you can pay off your debts, remember small amounts add up over time.

What are some debt payoff strategies?   The best way to pay off debt is the one you will follow! If you need quick wins, consider the debt snowball; if you are tired of paying interest, consider the debt avalanche.

I remember I came home to tell her a doctor said I wouldn’t live to see 21. I just celebrated my 28th birthday.. My mom is my Rock, my Queen, my Shero.

We now live in different states. We continue to celebrate our birthdays together since it’s on the same day. She will visit me or I will go to her place. She knows me better than anyone in my life. She supports me and will give advice when appropriate. We talk and share through the year. When I’m down I know she will listen and give support. One person in your life that cares is a valuable asset. I cherish her with all my heart. We are truly sisters.” – Noreen  on Facebook  “Thankful doesn’t even describe the word I have for my dad, a girl couldn’t ask for a better one. My dad has definitely been there through thick and thin. He has raised myself and my siblings practicality by himself, he has worked so hard to give us the things we needed. We may not have got everything we wanted but he made sure we had a roof over our heads and food in our bellies. He has taught me the value of money, and has taught me that money does not give you happiness. He has helped me through everything. My dad is my hole world and he deserves great things. I would give him the shirt off of my back because i know he would do it for anybody else.” – Amanda  on Facebook  “I am most thankful for my son. Many times in my life I have always felt like no one was there but he has been next to me every step of the way.

I am fighting for him I am fighting for a better future.” – Dymond  on Facebook  My Mom made the best of whatever we had and made it looked as if it were fit for a king and queen.  It was only later as a teenager did I realize that I didn’t see her eat often when I was young or only after serving me or that some of my favorite dishes were made of noodles or eggs and other low cost staples.  But she always smiled and She. Always. Found. Money. To. Save.  I grew to respect her hardwork and sacrifice so much that I would often ask to thrift for new clothes and skipped asking for senior pictures/trips.  I remember being excited to find a dress for senior prom for $20 because it wouldn’t stretch my Mom too much.  My Mom was 19 when I came along, but I am proud to say 40 years later she is a leader in her field of Finance and Technology.

{"prompt":"Ja’Net’s Story: Helping People Achieve Financial Prosperity","completion":" Meet Ja’Net, a full-time entrepreneur and mother of two who lives in Kernersville, North Carolina.  What does school look like for your kids right now?  My 13-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter are both in virtual school and will be until at least January 11 of next year. They’re ready to go back to school, but COVID-19 cases are surging again in our area.   Tell me about your job.   I’ve been an entrepreneur for nine years now. Normally, I spend my time traveling and doing speaking engagements all across the country. The travel restrictions have been a blessing in disguise for my business because I’ve been able to reach more people on my digital platform. I’ve been able to grow my online presence and webinar attendance because it’s all online now and more accessible. My main audience is college students, who can now attend my webinars on their phone since everything is digital. And now I can spend more quality time with my kids because I’m not traveling as much. I’ve been able to do things like host a webinar and then take my daughter to tennis—that’s been phenomenal.  I enjoy what I do so much that it doesn’t feel like a job to be. Even yesterday, I was trying to figure out Facebook ads and that alone gave me so much joy! When I’m really in the mood to relax, I’ll watch a Marvel movie.   “My business is  Debt Sucks University  and my main goal is to help others financially live their dreams.”   How did you start your own business?  I was in corporate America prior to starting  Debt Sucks University . I got laid off from my job and  took two years to pay off $50,000 of debt. This all started because I did one presentation and got paid for speaking. After that interaction, I thought, “Maybe I could turn this into something.” Nine years later and I’m still going strong.  What’s the most rewarding part of your job?  I love seeing the “lightbulb” turn on for people when they realize that they can manage their debt and pay it off. I feel like I’m really making a difference when someone reaches out to me with their testimonial of how they were able to pay off their debt.   What does a day in your life currently look like?   I wake up at 6am, journal, pray, respond to and send out emails, then wake up my kids at 7am. My son practices basketball for an hour and my daughter practices tennis, too. We eat breakfast as a family before I adopt the role of tech support specialist for their virtual school. While they’re on their laptops, I set up calls with clients, write proposals for my business, and act as a teacher assistance when they need help. Once they’re done with school, we have about 30 minutes before they have to go to their respective sports practices in person.  Do you teach your kids about money?  Yes, we definitely talk about money when the subject comes up. For example, we listen to NPR in the car and I answer any questions they may have about finances. Earlier this year, my daughter asked what going bankrupt meant. I explained that it was when a company owed people more money than it had coming in. Another example was when they saw our local IHOP close. We had that same conversation about bankruptcy. And when we go to the grocery store, they see what I’ve budgeted for and it’s nice to see them learn that those savings add up over time. Even if it’s something like $0.40 savings on one item, you’re saving money.  Can you tell me more about your financial situation?  I have a spending plan each and every month. I have part of the sports package on Sling and I turn it off for the month before the NBA season comes on again so I can save a little money. Whenever I look at what I’m bringing in, I think, “How can I save for myself and my kids?” I want to make sure their college accounts, regular savings accounts, and Roth IRAs are well-funded.   Do you have any milestones for your business that you’d like to achieve?  I’m looking to expand internationally to London, Ghana, and Canada. There are a lot of expatriates there and I feel like what I teach is still relevant to a lot of them. For example, they could be living abroad but still be weighed down by student debt.  Are you shopping for the holidays this year?  I’m definitely getting my children something. Their grandparents also like to go overboard with the presents. Luckily, my children are pretty reserved when it comes to gifts. My daughter said she wants an Easy Bake oven and a Baby Alive, and those are pretty reasonably priced. And my son would never ask me for a PS5. They’re very into traveling. I like to teach my children the value of experiences compared to material things.   Tell me about your proudest financial accomplishment.  I’ve always wanted to give back to those who gave so much to me. For example, I gave my 70-year-old mother a year’s worth of trips. Of course, this was before the pandemic so we had to move a few trips to 2021, but we still plan on taking them when we get the chance. Before COVID-19 hit, we were in Paris and London for a week. My kids came along, too. You know, those locations in Europe are such landmarks. Places like the Eiffel Tower and London Eye are so iconic, and they’re in all the cartoons they watch. So now when they watch their shows, they realize, “Oh, I’ve been there! I’ve seen that!”  My mother really taught me everything. She was a Human Resources Director and she taught me how to dress professionally. Before my father passed away, both my parents taught me about money.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I discovered you all at  FinCon  last year! I thought it was cool that SaverLife rewards people cash for saving money.  The time between recessions is getting shorter and shorter, and I like that you all are helping people prepare for the future. I also like that SaverLife encourages its members to find the money they can to save and build a sense of financial security. Having a good mindset when you’re working toward financial wellness really makes a difference. "}
{"prompt":"Gabe and Melanie’s Story: The Book-Cataloging, Animal-Rescuing, Debt-Free Duo","completion":" Meet Gabe and Melanie, a book-selling couple who lives with their two kids in Sand Lake, Michigan.  What’s it like in your household?  Melanie : We’ve lived in our old farmhouse in a rural community since 1994. Right now, our two college-aged kids live with us because they’re going to school remotely. One goes to the University of Michigan and the other goes to Michigan State University. They’ve paid for most of their college tuition through grants and scholarships.  We’ve been vegetarian – and now vegan – for 25 years and we’ve always taken in and re-homed animals in need like cats, dogs, chickens, pigs, and goats.  How has COVID-19 impacted your family?  Melanie : My company downsized in February right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. I worked for a large international company that was looking to cut costs. I worked with the company on and off since 1993. Then I took a decade off to take care of my parents and build our bookstore business. Now is the worst time to be looking for a job, and it’s hard to know what’s even safe to do during a time like this. We used my income to pay the bills.  Gabe : I’ve been a bookseller as my primary occupation since 2007, though since COVID I’ve been working part-time as a cleaner at a hospital to help make up for lost income.  How’d you start your business?  Gabe : We used to sell books at shows and through catalogs, but in 2007 we decided to open a physical store. We ran that for 10 years and it was enjoyable, but like a lot of other businesses, you’re working 80 hours a week and we weren’t making enough money to hire employees. We sold the physical business in 2017 and went online. Now we sell our books on sites like Biblio and Amazon. Those sales have increased a little since people are buying books from their home, but it’s nowhere near the sales we’d make in a regular year.  We specialize in a variety of unusual and rare material that we sell primarily to university special collections libraries. But since COVID, many libraries have put a freeze on spending which has really impacted our sales.  Melanie : This grew out of Gabe’s obsession with books. No matter what he was into, he had to have all the books about that topic. Our business is named Bay Leaf Books, and we sell general stock and rare books online and through catalogs.  In a typical year, what kinds of books do you sell?  Gabe : While we sell general stock on our website, we often come across unusual items and it’s nice to find the right home for them.  We’ve sold material as varied as an antique family photo album detailing a trip to Niagara Falls to an early punk zine from the late-1970s. Both went to institutions that specialize in those areas. In the past couple of weeks, we have sold a book on experimental art that was bound in metal and a University of Michigan scrapbook from the 1920s.  Some of these items sell for as little as $20, while some have sold for as much as $20,000, including a large collection of American bookplates that included the ex libris of George Washington.   What does budgeting look like?  Melanie:  I’ve been pinching pennies since I was laid off. I tallied up the price of all our favorite recipes and know how much it costs each week. After couponing and stocking up whenever there’s a sale, I’d say we spend less than $100 a week on groceries. When I see something’s on sale, I’ll stock up on it. I can do meal planning since I’m not working right now. I downloaded Ibotta and Fetch Rewards, which help you earn cash back for grocery shopping. We’ve also saved a little money by not going out as much and eating out.  I’ve been using apps like Swagbucks and Clickwork to work from home. Since May, I’ve earned about $1,000.  Gabe:  It’s a lot of small things we’re not spending money on anymore that helps us save. For example, I don’t go out and get coffee and instead drink instant coffee at home. The lockdown has actually been enjoyable for us since we’re homebodies. We’ve got a buffer of land around us which has been nice, and we don’t mind staying home.  Aside from my books, we live a minimalist lifestyle.  Tell me more about your minimalist lifestyle.  Melanie : For me, the zero-waste lifestyle was a natural progression. My dad had early onset Parkinson’s and by the time he was 50, he was retired. My mom saved every penny and we grew up pretty frugal. As Gabe and I got older, we became more conscious about what we buy. We use cloth napkins that I bought at a garage sale, and most of our appliances are “gently used.” We’ve probably saved thousands of dollars over the years just by buying things second-hand. I’ve also been the book scout for Gabe and I’ve developed an eye for what might be valuable. The adage “reuse, repair, recycle” is not only good for the environment, it’s great for the pocket-book.  What would you like to do when things are better?  Gabe : I’d like to go out and visit my mom in Arizona when it’s safer, but other than that I don’t feel like I’m missing out on much.  Melanie : I don’t feel limited right now. Like I said, we’re homebodies. We have a trail right in our backyard and I’ve been able to see bald eagles, coyotes, and deer.  Are you two saving for anything in particular?  Melanie:  It’d be nice to retire someday. With all the disruptions we’ve had in our lives (like leaving work to help my parents in 2008), our number one goal now is to save enough money so we have funds when we’re old.  Gabe:  During COVID, I’d say we’re saving for general survival (laughs).  What would you say is your biggest expense right now?  Melanie : Definitely the animals. Many of the animals we haven’t been able to re-home have health problems, so that’s a big expense. Gabe has really outfitted our house to accommodate all the animals we have. He recently built cat shelves that are like a cat condo and an outdoor catio.  Gabe : The veterinary bills, vaccinations, and food really add up.  Tell me about your biggest financial achievement.  Melanie : We’re not in debt, we don’t have a mortgage or car payment, and we have a good start on retirement savings. We don’t owe anybody anything.  Gabe : We always tried to live within our means and pay off what we owe. If we need a car, we’ll buy a good quality used car that we can pay cash for.  No loans! "}
{"prompt":"Meet Stacie, SaverLife’s Grand Prize Winner of the Johnstown Story Contest","completion":"    Stacie was the  Grand Prize Winner of our Johnstown Story Contest . While we weren’t able to congratulate her in person this year due to travel advisories, we scheduled a Zoom call to meet her!  Where did you grow up?   I grew up in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. I moved back here after college to be closer to family.  What do you like about Johnstown?   Johnstown is a pretty small community. I went to St. Francis College, where I earned my baccalaureate degree in nursing. What I like about Johnstown is that it’s a much smaller community and everybody knows everybody.  Do you still know a lot of people there from when you grew up?   Yeah, surprisingly. A lot of people moved away, but many people moved back like I did.  Who’s in your family?   It’s just me and my daughter, Chaya. She’s going to be a sophomore in high school next year and she’s looking forward to driving. She just turned 15 in May, so next year is the big sweet sixteen.  What does going back to school look like for your daughter?   All the students are planning to go back. Of course, there’ll be a couple of modifications, but they are going to go back to learn in the brick and mortar buildings. That will be good for them because this is the age where building those close friendships is really important.  Are you currently employed?  I was a nurse, but now I’m retired. I can’t work because of my medical conditions, so I’m on disability right now. It was a huge blessing to be able to win the $5,000 from the Johnstown Story Contest. I’ll be able to start a nice little nest egg for my daughter’s college fund because now is when we’re getting ready to apply for all the grants and the scholarships available.   Have you guys been impacted by COVID-19?   Our cost of living has increased. I really relied on school meals for her when she was going to school in-person. I counted on them for breakfast and lunch to help us pull through. Her school ended up having summer programs to keep the students fed, but still the prices of things increased. We felt the price increase a little bit, but it wasn’t as much as what other people probably experienced.  Did you have any savings to help you get through these uncertain times?   Actually, no. We pretty much just live paycheck to paycheck right now, so we can’t plan for emergencies. That’s why I started with SaverLife back in January. After I joined SaverLife, I wanted to try and start saving money. Then COVID-19 happened, so things got crazy. I never had a dedicated savings account before this year, and it was my first time attempting to save for my daughter’s college.  What was it like finding out on TV that you had won $5,000 from the Johnstown Story Contest?  I think the news people were trying to keep it a secret. I kept thinking there were going to be other finalists coming, so that threw me off. In my mind, I thought that there were going to be at least two other finalists coming. I’ve never really won anything before, so I had no clue how these things work.  How has your family and friends reacted?   Oh, everybody was really surprised, supportive, and happy for me. They kept saying, “Oh my gosh, you deserve it so much!”   I went through a lot with losing my father four years ago. He had prostate cancer, and prior to that my mom was actually diagnosed with a terminal illness. That’s why I had to move back to Johnstown. I came back here to take care of both of my parents who were simultaneously dying from terminal illnesses, so everybody was just really happy that I had something positive happen to me.  What are you planning to do with the money?   I’m going to put it in the savings fund that I opened up for Chaya’s college education. Winning this money means that Chaya can have a chance at actually starting college and securing her future. When I opened the account, I had to call it something, so I named it “Chaya’s College Fund.” I’m excited to see her college fund grow.   What did you learn about money when you were a kid?   We were a middle class family and lived pretty modestly. My dad was a businessman and owned three different businesses. He was a steeplejack, and he also invented this pigeon control called Cat Claw. It was a stainless steel pigeon that was as sharp as knives. You put it on the end of church buildings so pigeons couldn’t roost there.  My dad taught me about integrity, saving, spending, and donating. He was very thrifty, too. We probably had money to do all kinds of things, but we just didn’t live above our means. I’ve always really known the value of a dollar and the importance of a good education. One of the first things my dad instilled in me was that it was really important that I went to college. I think that’s why it’s really important to me that Chaya has that chance, too.  Have you had ups and downs with money into your life?   Oh, yes. I’ve had, and I’ve had not. I have a very strong faith in God, so I’ve always let Him get me through the hard times. When we’re weak, he’s strong. When the times weren’t so good, I relied on family, church, and friends. And when times were good, I tried to give back with tithes—whether it’s for my family or the community.  Other than Chaya’s college fund, what are your savings or financial goals?   I want to get her to where she’s financially stable so she can get married and have kids or whatnot. She’s been my main priority for the last 18 years. My financial goals are to support her and help her with what she needs in life.   What’s your favorite thing about SaverLife?   That you get paid for saving money. SaverLife encourages you to keep saving, and the website has all kinds of activities you can do. Plus, it’s a great website to learn about how to spend and invest your money. I also enjoy the free financial coaching that’s offered because I was able to talk to someone and have them answer my specific money questions. "}
{"prompt":"6 Myths About Receiving the Child Tax Credit","completion":" Stop! Don’t know where to start when it comes to claiming the Child Tax Credit?  Take our short quiz to find out .  Myth #1:  “My kid is 17 years old, so I won’t get the advanced Child Tax Credit.”  Yes, you can! This was a significant change that was included in the American Rescue Plan. As long as your child doesn’t turn 18 years old before December 31, 2021, your family will be eligible to receive the advance monthly payments for the rest of the year.   Tip : Check out our  One-Stop Guide  on the Child Tax Credit for more info on how to claim your funds.  Myth #2:  “My ex and I usually switch off who claims our kids as dependents, so I won’t receive the money.”  This is tricky because it all depends on who filed taxes last. If you filed taxes last, then you’ll receive the advanced monthly payments. But if your ex-partner filed last year, then they will receive the advanced monthly payments. Have a conversation with them about how you two would like the payments to work out, and use this  IRS Update Payment Portal  to make any changes after that talk.  Myth #3:  “I get public benefits, so I’m disqualified from getting the advanced Child Tax Credit.”  Incorrect! The federal government wanted to make sure that as many families as possible could receive these payments. If you receive public benefits, such as SNAP, you can still receive the advanced monthly Child Tax Credit payments. Read our  2-minute article  for more information.  Myth #4:  “I have student loan debt, so I can’t receive the advanced Child Tax Credit.”  This is  somewhat  untrue. The advanced monthly Child Tax Credit payments ( see schedule here ) will  not be garnished . However, when you file taxes next year, the other half of the Child Tax Credit that you’ll get as a lump sum refund  may be seized to repay federal student loans  — if you are in default.   Tip : If you defaulted on your student loans,  click here to learn more  about your repayment options.  Myth #5:  “I haven’t filed my taxes in the last few years, so I can’t get the monthly payments.”  If you  DID  fill out the IRS Non-filer form to claim any of the last year’s stimulus checks, you should automatically receive the advanced monthly Child Tax Credit payments. However you received the stimulus checks last year, by check or direct deposit, that’s how you’ll get the Child Tax Credit payments.   If you  DIDN’T  fill out the IRS Non-filer form to claim any of the stimulus checks in the last year, use this  IRS Non-filer tool  to claim the advanced monthly Child Tax Credit payments.   Myth #6:  “My baby was born in 2021, so I can’t receive the advanced Child Tax Credit until next year.”  FALSE: If you have had a baby in 2021, congratulations! You could claim  up to $3,600  through the advance Child Tax Credit.  BONUS  Join our exclusive, private Facebook group  to learn more about our advocacy efforts and get involved.

{"prompt":"Ramona’s Story: Community Activist and Small Business Owner","completion":" Ramona Ferreyra is a community activist and small business owner committed to making a difference in the Bronx neighborhood where she lives. From sourcing masks for essential workers to bringing medicine to sick neighbors, Ramona has used her skills as a community organizer to help everyone around her ride out the COVID-19 crisis. But for Ramona to be able to aid others, she needs support herself.   Ramona and her grandmother, 89, live together in a one-bedroom apartment. Chronic health issues have made it impossible for Ramona to work in most traditional jobs. They rely on sales from Ramona’s clothing business, Ojala Threads (baby and children’s clothes inspired by her Hispanic heritage) and some government support to survive. But with the COVID-19 crisis, Ramona’s sales have dropped dramatically, and she had to cancel all her pop-up events. Ramona and her grandmother’s food stamps ran out weeks ago, and their situation was beginning to feel dire.   “One of the frustrating things about the work that I do in the community is that there is a system set up where you are expected to do the work because you know it’s important, but you’re not paid for it,” said Ramona. Ramona loves the activism work that she does, but it doesn’t support her financially. With support from Humanity Forward through a partnership between Neighborhood Trust and SaverLife, Ramona received a direct $1,000 payment to help her feel a little more secure and get back to doing what she does best: building a better future for her community.   “[The payment] was life-changing,” said Ramona. Ramona used some of the funds to make two credit card payments to pay down some of her debt. She also plans to invest in Google and Facebook ads for Ojala Threads, a marketing strategy she couldn’t afford before.   The rest of her payment she put in the bank, to help her and her grandmother ride out the next few months of the crisis.   It was also important to Ramona to purchase small items, like essentials for her pets — her dog Brownie and her rabbit — and some supplies to make things a little easier for her and her grandmother, including a new can opener and a steam mop. “They’re small things, but they mean a lot. They’re a super big deal.”   “At a time like this, when we have lost three neighbors just in this building…I am already so emotionally exhausted that with the added weight of being poor, there was a time that I wasn’t sure I was going to make it through this because of the financial pressure. And that $1,000, for someone who is used to living on $190 a month–that will last me like three months. For me, this is like a quarterly investment. Look at everything I can accomplish with that money.”  We are so glad we could take a little weight off Ramona’s shoulders. We can’t wait to see what the future holds for her and her business!  "}
{"prompt":"Meet the Savers Win $5,000 Winner!","completion":"In early 2018, we launched Savers Win, a new way to reward you for saving. Savers Win gave away over $10,000 in cash prizes to Savers all across the country, including a $5,000 grand prize.

{"prompt":"Danielle’s Story: Give Good Out, Get Good Back","completion":" Meet Danielle, a scrapbooking entrepreneur and blogger who lives with her husband, 3-year-old son, and mother-in-law in Florida.   What’s your profession?  I’ve always loved scrapbooking and putting everything together. After making a few for friends and family, I decided to start my own scrapbooking and memorabilia business. It started out as a page on Facebook called Love Sissy Love, but now everything is done through the phone. I recently hired a couple of artistic friends of mine to help out as well! This year, I’ve made about 37 scrapbooks and 14 memorabilia projects.  Scrapbooking is fun, but my real passion is writing. That’s why I started a blog. It’s called Dani’s Rambling Again. When I first started reviewing Amazon products, I was reviewing just about everything and anything. Now, I actually get to work with bigger companies like Dyson. When you get comfortable with the sellers on Amazon, you can pick what you want to review.  Since I’ve had a kid, I’ve been able to review baby and toddler items. Just from reviewing items, I got a whole year’s worth of wipes and diapers! It’s also cool to get snack samples that aren’t yet available in stores.  If you can’t tell, I don’t like working 9-5 jobs. I don’t like clocking in, and I don’t like having to schedule, schedule, schedule. My last 9-5 was at Publix. It wasn’t as great as I thought, and when I got sick, people weren’t really sympathetic. There was also a manager who was pushing me to leave. He ended up firing me for something I didn’t do. I filed a report, and my case went to court, where I ended up winning.  What does the future of your scrapbooking business look like?  Pre-COVID, I was actually trying to buy some shared space at the shopping plaza to sell my scrapbooks. Once I start saving again, that’s where I’m headed. My dream isn’t going anywhere.  What does a day in your life currently look like?  I’m usually woken up by my 3-year-old poking my face or playing with our rescue dog. Then we do breakfast, and while I try my best to feed my little one something healthy, it’s ended up being ice cream recently. After breakfast, we take our dog for a walk, I come home and check my messages and emails, and my husband and I clean the house.  These days, I’m trying to make calls to people who might be interested in my scrapbooking business as opposed to waiting for them to call me. I’m the only driver in the house, so I usually play taxi mom, which sets me back on work. My son’s trailing behind me 24 hours a day Cooking, cleaning, working—that’s pretty much my day. Somehow, it always works out by the end of the day.  How’s life at home been since COVID?  Well, it’s just been me, my husband, our 3-year-old, our puppy rescue, and my husband’s mother. And two weeks ago, we started hosting a homeless pregnant woman in our spare room. I saw her twice at the gas station, and she looked just about ready to pop. The day we brought her home, she actually went into labor. She’s going to stay with us until she can get things figured out.  I’m a big believer in good karma. What goes around comes around, and I hope the good comes back.   What would you like to do after this is all over?  I want to go to the beach. That’s where I reflect. Where we live now, we’d have to drive an hour to get there. I already told my husband, “We’re going to the beach once this is over.”  When we lived in Fort Lauderdale, my best friend and I had the same work schedule, and we’d go to the beach every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. That was our ritual.  What’s your proudest financial achievement?  I have two. The first is when my sister entered me into a poetry content when I was 16. I was up against thousands of people, and I won two years in a row. It made me feel more noticed.  The second was a yard sale my friends and I put together for a buddy of ours. His mother was dealing with cancer in the hospital, and he wanted to visit her. We brought our stuff to the car wash to get more foot traffic. To make more money, we ran a booth called “Conversation with a cool chick” and charged $5. We made enough money to send both him and his wife to see his mother.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  Oh yes, and way more than I wanted to or probably should have. In the beginning of the pandemic, I was buying brands I wouldn’t normally buy because that’s what was available. Now I’m pinching pennies, and I’ve downloaded all those apps where you can earn rewards and save money.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It depends on what day it is. Here are just a few things it means:  “A ways to get by”  “Evil”  “A necessity”  “Doing the funner things in life”  I try not to spend it frivolously because I’m not just taking care of myself anymore.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  Because of SaverLife, I started saving pretty well. I love it! I found out about it through FreshEBT. It’s more interactive now with the  forum ,  Saver Stories , and different ways to  earn points . "}
{"prompt":"How a Dedicated Savings Account Can Help You Save","completion":"It may seem obvious, but it’s easier to save money in a savings account! When you sign up for SaverLife, you have the option to link either a checking or savings account. But if you read the fine print, you may notice that we suggest using a savings account.  Here’s why : our research shows that people who link a savings account are more successful at saving (and we want to help you also save more successfully!). In fact, using a savings account makes you  11% more likely  to save every month compared to a checking account. And that makes sense, right? You may deposit and withdraw money from your checking account every day, making it hard to keep track of the money you’re saving.  But the choice is yours!  On average, we know that people save more in a dedicated savings account – but SaverLife is all about figuring out what works  for you . Over a quarter of Savers link a checking account, and for many of them, that works! We asked some Savers who linked a checking account why they use a checking account to save with SaverLife, and here’s what they told us:   Malea, a Saver from California, told us that she prefers to save in a dedicated savings account, because “I am able to see how much I am truly saving each month and it is very rewarding.” "}
{"prompt":"The First Step to Making Your Vote Count","completion":" As you save for your future, it’s also important to vote for your future. There are a lot of reasons to vote, but here’s an important one: by voting, you control who represents your interests in government.

When you vote, it’s on record that you have a voice and you’re active in democracy. And in challenging times, it’s even more important to vote. Your vote helps create a better future for yourself and your family.

{"prompt":"Latest SaverLife Research: How Work, School, and Parenting Are Impacting Low-Income Parents","completion":" Parents of remote-schooled children are earning less money and facing increased expenses while being forced to make impossible choices between work and family.   Low-income families were battling poverty and inequality, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only made things worse. Now is the time to start redesigning the way we systematically address opportunity and mobility in our society and culture.    Families with children are earning less  Households with dependent children have been impacted much more than households without children. 76% of parents report earning less money now compared to pre-pandemic. This is a 57% increase vs. non-parents.   68% of parents say their children aren’t attending school in-person. This makes it increasingly difficult to earn income.  As of January,  half of all American children are still learning virtually , and even schools that are “open” are often not operating 100%. Most schools have adapted by using smaller cohorts and shorter schedules to adhere to public health guidelines. School children have been learning from home for about a year, which has put a financial strain on parents.  The parents of children who have been remote-learning are 35% more likely to say they have a difficult time earning money than parents whose children are attending school in-person.

Those same parents with remote-schooled children are 19% more likely to say their expenses have increased compared to parents whose children are learning in-person.  These results are even more striking for people of color, as 82% of non-white members with children indicate that their expenses have increased during the pandemic  (vs. 72% for white members).

Additionally, without the care and support provided by open schools, parents of remote-schooled children are having to cover increased costs for childcare and school supplies.

{"prompt":"Lucinda’s Story: Sweepstakes Savvy & Smart About Money","completion":" Meet Lucinda, a veteran restaurant server who lives with her husband in Tucson, Arizona.  What’s it like where you live?  It’s nice and sunny here in Tucson. I’ve been there all my life. It’s just got that good hometown feel. People are nice, friendly, and helpful.  What do you do?  I’m a restaurant server. I’ve been doing that 35 years, and I’ve run the gamut of the hospitality industry. Sometimes I’ll see celebrities come in, so that’s always kind of fun.  What did your upbringing teach you about finances?  I definitely learned how to save. I got a pretty generous allowance growing up. My mom trusted my older brother and me with a good amount of money to learn how to manage.  If I wanted shoes that cost more than $8 Keds, I had to save up my money to pay the difference. In that sense, I learned to choose my premium items wisely.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Serving is seasonal in Arizona. You make a good six months of income, but the rest of the year you have to budget it out. Having a separate account is nice. I actually use my PayPal account for direct deposit to help me save during the off-season. It’s nice to have a separate account for savings for the rest of the year.   What do you do during the off-season?  One thing I do to offset it is national sweepstakes. It doesn’t pay the bills, but it’s something. All my kids have December birthdays, so that’s how I originally got into sweepstakes. I still have a running list of all the ones I’ve participated in, and I use it to keep track of my current ones as well. Movie tickets, drinks, and popcorn are common, easy wins. I also pick up gifts and gift cards here and there, which helps during the holiday season.  I’m a grandma, so I like to buy all the membership cards for things so I can take my grandkids out. I try to get all those entertainment purchases out of the way.  What kind of money lessons are you trying to instill in your grandkids?  We’ve actually been talking a lot about price comparison and learning the value of their money. They recently got Walmart gift cards from their great-grandmother for their birthdays, and they wanted to buy rollerblades.  Something interesting about Walmart is that stores may price their items differently. I usually check their app to see the price difference. This came in handy when we found rollerblades for $7 as opposed to $33 at the original store where we were going to buy them. Sure, it took 10 more minutes to drive to a further Walmart, but that was a valuable lesson for them for sure. It was worth the wait.  I also use Popcart, which is a browser extension. If you have an item you’re searching for, it’ll look across the web and compare prices for you. My grandkids are now using the app to reference the price of what they’re looking to buy.   It sounds like you love to spend time with your grandkids. How are your kids?  Well, my daughter wanted to be an EMT, which involved school and some 24-hour shifts. She eventually bought her first house. Both my husband and I are proud that she was about to set herself up to be a homeowner. Had we not stepped in to take care of her kids when she was in EMT school, I don’t think she would’ve been able to complete it. Plus, that meant more time with my grandkids!  What are your goals for the future?  I kind of want to retire at some point. I’m just getting ready to turn 53. I’m on what they call “short time,” where you have 10 years until you retire. The ‘08-’09 Recession took away the retirement and savings that my husband and I had built.  I went back to serving after 13 years as a General Manager, so that was a big income shift for me. While it took some time to adjust financially, I was grateful that I could now hang out with my kids. I want to keep spending time with them.  What does money mean to you in your life?  I’ve learned that it’s not the most important thing, but it means being able to pay the bills comfortably and on time. Sometimes it’s worth it to chase every dollar, but ultimately money comes and goes.  Right now, I’m trying to save. My kids are set up and the grandkids are in school, so it’s time for my husband and me to focus on saving these next ten years.  How did you feel about winning $50 from the SaverLife Tax Time Pledge?  I was so excited! I just clicked on it and I couldn’t believe it. The SaverLife site is also really helpful, especially all the info about social security and saving money in general. The information isn’t just for certain types of savers. It covers all aspects of your financial life. The content is very well laid out, and it isn’t overly long. I was really happy that a sweepstakes site brought me to SaverLife.  I’m going to keep the money I won in my PayPal for the off-season. That’s my backup plan. Come September or October, it’ll be handy to buy some food or to do something extra with the grandkids. "}
{"prompt":"Tashana’s Story: Helping Foster Youth Financially Prepare for the Future","completion":" Meet Tashana, a social worker who lives with her fiancé and two kids in Virginia.  Tell me about where you live and what your home is like.  My family and I moved to Arlington, Virginia in December of 2017. Before that, I lived in Erie, Pennsylvania. My fiancé and I got engaged last September. We have very different tactics when handling money. He’s not as enthusiastic to get rid of the debt and likes to stick to making minimum payments. We’ve worked out a way to meet each other where we are financially and find a happy medium when making financial decisions.   What brought you to Virginia?  Poverty. I graduated in 2012 with a Bachelor’s in social work. During that time, I struggled to find sustainable work, so I worked a lot of part-time jobs. The wealth disparity was the worst. The highest paid job I got was $11.25/hour. Before that, $9/hour was the highest. In 2016, I decided to go back to get my Master’s degree, and in 2017 I started applying out of the area.   Interestingly enough,  USA Today posted an article  about the worst cities for African Americans to live in, and Erie, Pennsylvania topped the list. It was a huge risk for me and my family to make that move to Arlington, but it was necessary. When that article was published about my hometown, it was really heartbreaking and a reality check. I experienced systemic racism. Seeing those numbers in black and white made the decision to leave more reassuring.   I’m actually able to help family members a little more. I help my grandmother, who’s experiencing dementia. It’s about a six hour drive to get back to my hometown. If I would’ve stayed, I wouldn’t be in a position to help her in the ways I am.    What was it like living in Erie, Pennsylvania?  I could never have all of my bills paid at once. Living like that for a while, you’re constantly in a crisis mode. I didn’t realize how much stress would stem from that. Now, I can have all my bills paid on time. It’s just completely different. I can actually save money now compared to worrying if I’m going to have enough to pay the bills. Some level of the financial discipline was there, but I didn’t have the knowledge and I had a lack of resources. Getting my Master’s put me in a position to earn more.   Were your kids with you when you were getting your degrees?  I had my daughter during my junior year of college. Right after I graduated, I found out I was pregnant again with my son. They’re the motivation. They help me color in my debt pay-down poster whenever a payment is made. I want to include them in the journey, and I want to put them in a better financial position financially than I was at their age.   Having those hard conversations is tough, but children tend to adapt to situations better than adults. I think having those lessons and having those real-life moments builds character in a child.    What’s your current job?   I have a Master’s in Social Work (MSW), so I work for an organization in DC. I supervise advocates who volunteer to work with youth in foster care. My case load tends to be older youth who will age out of care on their own. I manage the “Preparing Youth For Adulthood” program. We’re actually holding a workshop called “Financially Lit” soon, talking about things like budgeting, saving, etc. When these youth exit the child welfare agency, they can get an escrow account, which the agency matches up to $12,000. We want to encourage them to use this program to build a strong financial foundation. Unfortunately, foster youth are susceptible to financial abuse and identity theft.   I’ve always worked with at-risk populations and had a passion to work with youth. I want to know who they are and not base them on their behaviors.   What does a day in your life currently look like?                                            We assist our kids with school, and then I have meetings and case check-ins with volunteers. I talk about what are the current needs of the youth that we’re serving. Around 3:30-4pm, I start preparing dinner. Then I go outside for a bit. I work on my blog  Hopeful Reality  from 8-11pm. Friday is always movie night in the house, and that’s when I don’t work on the blog. My kids hold me to that. During the weekends, we used to go to church on Sundays pre-COVID, but now we attend online church services.   Tell me more about your blog.  I launched it in Sept 2018, and it was something I wanted to do to document my debt journey. I’ve always been a writer at heart, and this has been a learning journey for me. It’s strengthened my research and financial literacy skills. To me, other people’s stories were so motivating. I was inspired to write about my own struggles with financial literacy and wanted to empower people to share their money stories.   In the Black community, we’re not having those money conversations enough. We need to build a sustainable life and get beyond that paycheck-to-paycheck life. I had a recent friend of mine who’s interested in blogging come to me for advice. I’m sharing with her what I wish I knew when I first started.   Money is a part of our lives. We need to make it work in our best interests. Not having money is sometimes due to a lack of knowledge, but mostly it’s because of a lack of resources.    What are you and your family saving for currently?  Right now, our savings goal is to have 3-6 months of income saved. We’re at the three months mark. After I saved my first $1,000, I realized I wanted to keep beefing up our emergency fund. I also opened up a 529 account for my kids after listening to some financial podcasts. I realized where I am with paying off my student loans, and I don’t want my kids to have student loans if they decide to go to college.   Eventually, we do want to buy a home. It’s such a big task, and I’m so debt adverse. I’m wondering how I can go about it in the most efficient way.   How do you feel about SaverLife?  I actually really like the concept of it. I found the organization when listening to a Paychecks & Balances podcast episode. They had a guest speaker who talked about SaverLife, the Scratch & Save challenge, and how the non-profit made savings fun and motivating.   The amount of resources SaverLife has is great. I’ve even been able to read some of the Saver Stories on there, too. I find it empowering for a non-profit organization to increase positive financial habits to populations that could use the support.  "}

{"prompt":"What Women’s History Month Means to Me: SaverLife’s Coaches Reflect on Their Financial Journeys","completion":" This year’s Women’s History Month is special, coming only a few months after our country inaugurated our first female vice president. The strides we’ve made in the 100 years since the passing of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote have been incredible.  40% of business owners  are women. There are  114% more women entrepreneurs  than there were 20 years ago.  But as great as these strides are, we still have a long way to go to achieve financial equality. The numbers vary, but statistics show a gap between how much women and men earn. We reached out to several SaverLife financial coaches to learn what Women’s History Month means to them.  My Financial Advice for Women, by Tania Brown, CFP  Women’s History Month inspires me to empower women financially. Here is my financial advice for my female clients.  1. Know Your Worth  Don’t assume your employer is paying you what you’re worth. Most likely, they aren’t. I encourage women to use salary calculators on websites like  Glassdoor ,  Payscale , and  Career Contessa  to estimate the average pay for your job.    2. Get Paid What You’re Worth  When I worked for a recruiting agency, I was amazed at how many men had fewer job qualifications yet demanded more money. Even when women met all of the job qualifications, they rarely negotiated their salaries. If you’re underpaid, make your case, and  ask for more money . You’re worth it.  3. Be Your Own Financial Advocate  When using financial services, do not assume the first offer you get is the only option. Single women  pay more for mortgage loans  than men. Women make up 57% of all higher education students but  hold nearly ⅔ of all debt .  I feel honored to work with SaverLife to help women make informed financial decisions.  Stand at the Helm of Your Own Financial Journey, by Maureen Paley, AFC  Women and their finances are relevant and imperative all year round, not just during Women’s History Month. That said, it’s important to remember that this is a month where we celebrate the successes, triumphs, sacrifices, and resilience of women around the world. Many of these victories have been connected to women’s fight for financial independence and self-sufficiency. When a woman’s financial well-being is intact, she is in touch with her values and makes her best decisions. She determines how her money engages with the world.  When I work with female clients, I usually find them excited when they discover or rediscover their birthright to manage their money: to call the shots on how their money gets spent and saved, to stand at the helm of their financial journey. When women get in touch with this internal and innate power, they often meet their goals. In fact, the help, support, and conditions needed to meet those goals tend to materialize on her path. It’s as if the financial goal is cheering that woman on and ready to work for her!  The more we can support the financial wellbeing of women, the more our communities will share in the successes, triumphs, sacrifices, and resilience that we honor during Women’s History Month.  Finding My Financial Confidence, by Lorna Saboe-Wounded Head, AFC  It has taken me years to be confident in my financial decisions. As a young adult, I was unsure of my financial abilities and had a feeling that I wasn’t doing things the right way. It has taken time to become confident in making personal financial decisions and to accept the mistake I have made. In fact, my confidence has increased because I learned from my mistakes.  The women highlighted during Women’s History Month have taken remarkable actions to improve the well-being of women and mothers. Their confidence to pursue their goals and learn from mistakes inspires me to empower women to be confident in making financial decisions.   So, where do we go from here?  We become each other’s top advocates and work together to achieve equality. First, we will have to become our own financial advocates and commit to educating ourselves and the next generation.  SaverLife  offers a ton of resources to help you become financially secure. Second, it’s encouraging and supporting each other in the marketplace. No one will understand the struggles of being a woman in the marketplace or working mom, other than us. The more women we can build up and grow in leadership positions, the quicker we can make the workplace more inclusive. "}
{"prompt":"Tracy’s Story: Keep Going & Don’t Lose Focus","completion":" Meet Tracy, a temporary employment agency employee who lives with her husband and two boys in Katy, TX.   What do you do?  I’m currently working full-time in a temporary employment agency. I was laid off last year, and I had to really cut back on expenses. While I’m glad that I have a job right now, I’m looking for more permanent full-time work. This in-between time has been nice because I have a steady flow of money coming in at the same time I’m applying to more permanent jobs.  I’d like to return to working in the administrative offices for universities. Prior to getting laid off, I worked in data analysis. The job market is changing, so things may be a bit different now in the field that I’m looking into.  I’m trying to do something a little different while also supporting my family at the same time.   What did your upbringing teach you about money?  Well, it’s funny. I mostly stayed with my grandparents when I was growing up. We didn’t talk about money because we just didn’t have it. My grandfather worked in a manufacturing plant and my grandmother was a house nurse, meaning she took care of homebound people. I would only see her on the weekends, and during the week she was a live-in nurse in her patients’ homes.  We tried to save whatever money we had. We had a garden in our backyard, so we were self-sufficient and lived off the land. And we even had a little farm that included chickens, so we had eggs to both consume and share with our neighbors. Also, nothing went to waste on the farm. For example, we distributed most of the parts of the pig to our neighbors.   The local store wasn’t within walking distance. We would go maybe twice a month because everything else came from our vegetable garden and farm.  What was it like growing up with your grandparents?  My grandmother pushed my brother and me to get an education. Both my grandparents felt that school was our job and that we needed to educate ourselves in order to be self-sufficient. My grandma would work extra shifts to get what we needed for school. She inspired me to be a hard worker.  If I have to work a double shift to get what I need, I will. I had to learn about savings accounts, pensions, and retirement funds all on my own. I know that as of right now, I have 10 more years until I can access my pensions from previous jobs.  What’s the best piece of financial advice you’ve received?  Don’t take things too personally. Everything we do with money is so emotional. When things look bleak, try to stay positive. I was unemployed for two and a half months, and my family had to survive off of one income. You have to find ways to be positive and cut corners.  Once the negativity starts setting in, you can lose focus. But you have to keep your focus. That’s what I try to do. I have a temporary job right now, but I had to go through four agencies to find something. When one thing doesn’t work, just keep trying and stay focused. Right now, I’m trying other means and mechanisms to find something more permanent.  I put things into high gear and rushed to get a new job. These unemployment agencies required at least 3 interviews a week, and I was getting about 10 a week. After 6 months, I updated my resume to get more interviews. The one good thing about doing so many is that I got used to answering weird questions.  What are your goals for your boys?  My oldest son is 27 and living on his own. I have my 15-year-old and 9-year-old sons at home. My 15-year old son is getting ready to go to college. I’m trying to help him get a music scholarship. We’re researching that right now to try to find something for him. A lot of universities are tuition free if you fall under a certain income bracket, which could really help us.  I also want to get a full-time, permanent position. When I find a job, I have to get a higher salary so my pension contribution stays high and I can receive higher monthly retirement benefits. My youngest will be in high school by the time, and I want to be financially stable by then. Right now it’s hard to save because we’re trying to cut where we can.   The most recent things to go were cable and satellite. We have services that are a lot cheaper than those two options.  How did you feel about winning $50 from the SaverLife Tax Time Pledge?  I was so excited! It was 2 or 3am when I saw the news in an email. I thought it was a joke at first, but I really did win! It came right on time. It was very helpful.  I want to keep the winnings in my PayPal in case of emergencies. That’s what I use my PayPal for—emergencies.  Overall, my goal is to save $500. I’ve only been working at the temp agency for about a week or two, so hopefully I can pay off some bills. You know those Barnum’s Animal Crackers plastic containers with the lid? I’ve already saved two containers worth of extra bills and change. "}
{"prompt":"Glorianna’s Story: 21st Century Entrepreneur","completion":" Meet Glorianna, an aspiring entrepreneur who lives with her husband and youngest son in Las Vegas, Nevada.  How’d you choose Las Vegas?  I’ve been here since August 2013. I came here in 2011 because a girlfriend of mine didn’t want to live alone. She didn’t answer her phone for two weeks, so I was on the streets and stayed in a shelter during that time. At the beginning of the third week, she finally answered her phone. I slept on her floor until I could make things work.  Before moving to Las Vegas, I lived in Oakland, California for 19 years. It wasn’t sustainable. I had to work 2-3 jobs just to pay the rent. It’s much cheaper in Las Vegas.  Do you try to teach your son about money?  My son has autism, so it’s a little difficult. He doesn’t understand the concept of money at all. The value of money is something he’s been learning. I give him household chores to do as a financial incentive, but then he goes and spends his cash at Starbucks. If the chore isn’t written down, he won’t do it.   What do you do for a living?  I’m unemployed at the moment. Currently, I’m building a website on Shopify, but it’s been a month and nothing’s really happened. I’m trying to create a permanent domain for my website. My goal is to become an entrepreneur. Eventually, I’d like to build this website for an online store, make money, hire people, and become financially set.   I have four adult kids, and I want to make sure that they’re taken care of, especially if something were to happen to me.  What did your childhood teach you about finances?  It really didn’t teach me anything. My childhood was all over the place. My mom left then came back. Then my dad left and came back. We ended up on the streets. I just want to make sure that my kids don’t have to go through that.  How did you get from that point in your life to where you are now?  I don’t know. I just put it in my head that I didn’t want to go through life thinking, “What’s gonna happen next?” In general, I try not to worry about the little things, which is difficult because I was recently diagnosed with PTSD and hypertension. I try not to let the situation overcome me.  What are your goals for the future?  First, I’d like to get my website up and running. Second, I’d like to be able to generate more income. But most of all, I want to be able to bring my family physically closer. My daughters live in Virginia and my other son is living in Los Angeles, and I really want to create a bond with my kids who are living out of state.  How long have you wanted to be an entrepreneur?  I’ve wanted to be an entrepreneur since I was 18. Years ago, I didn’t think I could do it because of monetary resources and the fact that my credit wasn’t good. The one thing I’ve discovered in my journey to become an entrepreneur is that it’s hard to get good advice from other people in this field.  What’s your background in website building?  Basically, I’m going to teach myself. My thinking is: if I can teach myself, I’ll be able to teach other people. Google has also been really helpful. I thank Google for everything.  How does budgeting work in your household?  I get food stamps since I’m unemployed, and they’ve been helpful. Other than that, I’m responsible for half our household bills. I’m very independent, and it’s hard for me to have someone else help me. Together, my husband and I have about $4,000 in bills monthly, and I’m responsible for $2,200 of that.  What does money mean to you in your life?  It really doesn’t mean that much. Truthfully, it would be nice to have more of it to afford things and go places. For example, I really want to travel with my son. He loves trains and haunted mansions. I would want to take him to a haunted mansion out in Pennsylvania.   How did you feel about winning $50 from the SaverLife Tax Time Pledge?  I was shocked as hell! I was happy. With me being unemployed, $50 is really going to help. I’m going to use my winnings to help build my business and pay for Facebook ads. "}

My side business of selling redone furniture has slowed down because people just aren’t leaving the house anymore. And even if they are, they can’t pay for the furniture I made because they might be out of a job. I didn’t realize it until recently but staying at home all day and not being able to do anything is expensive.  What’s your profession?  You could say I’m a jack of all trades. Technically, I would be considered a Customer Service Associate. I’ve done all sorts of jobs in that field. I’ve even been a barista.  Someday, I’d like to open up a store of my own that includes furniture I’ve redone.   Could you talk more about what your store would sell?  Well, my partner is a Wiccan, and I’ve always been interested in the religion. I want to incorporate a Wiccan background and hopefully appeal to a different audience. As much as possible, I want to make it just an interesting and fun shop to go into. I love to make art and redo furniture, so I definitely want to sell those kinds of things, but I also want to include homemade crafts from local artists.  How do you and your partner stay grounded in these times?  We’re working on our respective projects and bringing the house up to our standards. There’s always a project to work on.   We are also doing lots of “trash for treasure” hunting. There’s never a dull moment. Monday nights – trash nights – are the most fun of the week. I found a sound bar, a power washer. I’m really into house plants and bookshelves.   We constantly have new stuff coming in and our friends like to go digging in our furniture.  What does a day in your life currently look like?   My grandma recently had surgery to get a pacemaker, so my partner and I are trying to help her as much as possible while still abiding by the quarantine. Most days once we wake up, we try to stop over and help her with what she needs, which includes going to the store if we need to.  Apart from that, we’re working on various projects with the assortment of stuff we get from Monday. Every so often we get friends who come through to purchase what we make. These days, we’re just trying to get the house together and stay sane until the world gets back to normal.  Are you currently looking for a job?   I’m looking for more of a permanent, regular employment so I can afford to do my side projects. At the moment, it’s tough to get a job because things are kind of shaky right now.  When we get our store up and running someday things will be easier, but until then I need a nice payday.  How are you feeling about your situation right now?  My partner and I normally live in our own bubble because we don’t have a TV. However, I’m staying connected to the news through my phone now more than ever. If things start to go south here in Akron, we’re going to head out to Manchester where my grandma is and stay with her. I’ve never seen anything like this before, so I don’t know what to expect, but I try not to get overwhelmed by all the conspiracies and the hype.   It was really stressing me out for a while. I’m just trying to work on our house trying to have some sort of normalcy again.  We’re just trying to do what’s advised and stay home. There are so many conflicting stories. Every day the news is definitely changing. It’s kind of scary, but it is what it is.   What would you like to do after this is all over?  I really want to go to the beach and have a couple of hours of uninterrupted beach time. I just need to recharge at the beach. A little refresher would be nice, or maybe a long weekend trip.  Have you had to dip into your savings to help weather what’s happening?  Actually yeah, I had a little bit of a 401(k) from a past job when I worked for a university. I recently had to cash that in. Once work stopped, I didn’t want to just live off government assistance. When everyone was buying a lot of toilet paper, we needed enough money to sustain ourselves for a bit.  How do you feel about SaverLife?  I think it’s a really cool idea! I love couponing and freebies. It’s kind of like a lifestyle trying to kind good deals. There’s a thrill to it.
