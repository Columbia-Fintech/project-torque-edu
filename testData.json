    "How to Apply for SNAP Benefits": " The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (otherwise known as SNAP) is a state-run program. Each state has its own process for applying. You can go to your local SNAP office, or some states even allow you to apply online. If you aren\u2019t sure, you can call the SNAP toll-free information number: 1-800-221-5689.  Each state has its own list of required documentation. In general, you\u2019ll need documentation proving your identity, household size, income, citizenship, social security number, and living expenses.  Once you\u2019ve submitted your application, you can expect to wait about 30 days before you hear if you are eligible. During that time, you will have to complete an eligibility interview. You can usually complete this interview by phone or in person. If you are eligible, you\u2019ll receive benefits back-dated to the date you submitted your application.  You may be able to receive benefits as early as seven days from your application date if you meet additional requirements. These requirements are a demonstration of extreme hardship. This may be the case if your household\u2019s combined gross income, and liquid resources are less than your monthly rent, mortgage, and utilities. Contact your state agency for additional details to see if you are eligible and how to proceed. ",

    "Help if You\u2019re Struggling to Pay Bills During the COVID-19 Crisis": " A few months ago, I didn\u2019t even know how to pronounce coronavirus (COVID-19), and couldn\u2019t have imagined how quickly our world would change. Now it\u2019s part of our daily vocabulary and has impacted every area of our economy.  If you are affected by the crisis, first, I am so sorry. Although it may feel like things are out of control, there are steps you can take that are 100% in your control and there are resources out there to help.  The Triangle of Survival  In this scary time, I want you to focus on the \u201cTriangle of Survival.\u201d This means food, shelter, and transportation. If your income is limited, survival is your first financial priority. Having food on the table and paying your rent or mortgage, your utilities, car payment, and insurance come first. Everything else comes second.  If you are struggling to pay your rent, food, and utilities, contact  2-1-1 . A representative will provide a list of local agencies to assist you.  Below are resources for assistance with different types of bills.  Mortgage Assistance  As of this writing, more and more mortgage lenders are offering relief for people impacted by the Coronavirus. If you cannot make a mortgage payment or think you may have a problem making a mortgage payment in the future due to a loss of income, immediately contact your mortgage provider about hardship programs. If you don\u2019t get help from the first representative you speak to, ask for a supervisor.  On March 18, 2020, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  suspended foreclosures and evictions  from FHA-insured single-family properties until at least the end of April. Contact your lender for more information and eligibility.  Rental Assistance  If you can\u2019t pay your rent, let your landlord know as quickly as possible. Ask if you can make payment arrangements for partial rent or pay the missed rent in the future over time. Ask for a waiver of late fees due to the current crisis.  Several counties around the country have suspended evictions and have directed landlords to give tenants up to six months to repay any unpaid rents. Contact your county for more information. Reach out to organizations such as United Way\u2019s 211, local churches, and non-profits for assistance.  Need Help Paying Bills  offers a ton of resources to help.  Utilities Assistance  Several utility providers are allowing customers who have been directly impacted by COVID-19 to defer payments, set up payment plans, and not disconnect services. For more information and eligibility requirements, contact your service provider. Reach out to United Way or call  2-1-1  for help paying utilities.  Credit Card Assistance  If you don\u2019t get help from the first representative you speak to, ask for the supervisor or the Hardship Department. Bankrate.com has a growing list of  credit card companies offering support  during this crisis.  Car Payment Assistance  Just like credit cards, reach out to your lender if you experience a drop in income that will impact your ability to make your car payment. Auto loan creditors like Ford, Nissan, Hyundai, General Motors, and Toyota may allow you to defer payments. Contact your auto lender and your auto insurance carrier for hardship programs and eligibility requirements.  It may be tempting to let your car insurance go. But if you can, pay your auto insurance bill. A few hundred dollars for auto insurance is a lot less than the several thousands of dollars you may have to pay if you are involved in a car accident.   Student Loan Assistance  If you are unable to make your federal student loan payment, go to the  Federal Student Aid website  to view your options. Contact your student loan provider as soon as possible to discuss your options and get help. If you are unsure of who your loan provider is, you can find them on  this website .  On March 13, President Trump announced that interest on most federal loans would be waived until further notice. Contact your student loan provider for more information.  Internet Assistance  It seems like those of us with kids have become instant homeschool parents! That makes internet access even more important. Several internet providers pledged with the FCC to provide relief due to hardships caused by COVID-19, including not disconnecting services and waiving late fees.  Several internet providers are offering help:  Comcast  is offering free access to Xfinity hotspots for everyone, including non-Xfinity internet subscribers. Charter Communications  is offering free Spectrum Broadband and Wi-Fi internet for the next 60 days. Link on the link above for more details. AT&T  is providing free access to public Wi-Fi Hot spots. Cox  is offering help for lower-income customers and eliminating data usage overages.  As the effects of the COVID-19 continue to impact the country, the list of assistance will expand. Keep reaching out to your creditors and providers for help. Remember, this too shall pass. ",
    "Three Reasons to File Taxes This Year \u2014 Even if You Don\u2019t Owe Money": " Tax season is underway, but with COVID-19 affecting millions of families across the country, from job losses to medical issues, filing taxes may not be at the top of your minds. This year, more than ever, it\u2019s important to file your taxes, especially if you lost work or haven\u2019t received your full stimulus funds. The government has made a lot of stimulus and tax benefits available, and filing taxes can help you claim this money.   Even if you don\u2019t owe money or normally don\u2019t file taxes, here are three reasons to file your taxes this year.   1. Receive Your Full Stimulus Payments  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal government has sent out two rounds of stimulus checks. If you should have been eligible, but didn\u2019t receive either or both of the payments, the only way to get that money is by filing your taxes. The IRS has also made mistakes, and many Americans haven\u2019t received money from the first or second stimulus payments.   If you didn\u2019t receive the full stimulus amount from either or both of the stimulus payments, it\u2019s not too late! You may be eligible for the  Recovery Rebate Credit . The stimulus payments were based on your 2019 income, so if you faced a loss in income in 2020, if you were newly independent in 2020, or if you had additional dependents in 2020, you may receive additional money when you file your 2020 tax return. Read more about  how to claim your stimulus payment  if you haven\u2019t received it yet.  Even if you don\u2019t normally file taxes (because you\u2019re on SSI or SSDI, you\u2019re retired, or you don\u2019t meet the IRS\u2019s income threshold), you need to do so this year to claim any missing stimulus money.  2. Claim Tax Credits  There are many tax credits that you may be eligible for, from the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to the Child Tax Credit. These credits can mean more money in your pocket to support yourself and your family.  The EITC helps working Americans by issuing them a credit when they file their taxes. If you qualify, your EITC will be based on your income and number of dependents.  Read more about the EITC , including some important changes this year and how your EITC may be impacted if you received unemployment benefits.  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has a helpful website dedicated to helping you understand what  tax credits you may be eligible for and how to claim them .  Use the \u201cLookback\u201d Feature to Maximize Your Refund   Did you earn less in 2020 than 2019? You could qualify for a bigger tax refund! Congress approved a new \u201clookback rule\u201d which means you can use either your 2019 or 2020 income on your taxes to get the biggest refund possible this year. Make sure you have your 2019 tax return available when you do your taxes this year.  ***  We\u2019ve also made a  cheat-sheet  on some great resources we recommend to help you navigate your taxes this year, including all of the ways you can file for free. Keep in mind that if you received unemployment benefits, you may owe taxes on those. If you run into any questions or are unsure whether you need to file, you can connect with other SaverLife members in the  forum . Either way, don\u2019t wait to file and claim the money you\u2019re due!  ",
    "5 Things To Do With Your COVID-19 Stimulus Check": " The COVID-19 stimulus checks are starting to arrive in bank accounts and mailboxes. If you\u2019re getting one, you may be wondering what to do with this money. First, I will say that the government is issuing this money to families to help with basic living essentials. We don\u2019t know how long our nation will be sheltering in place, nor do we know how long it will take our country and businesses to recover.   If you are still able to work and you haven\u2019t lost your income, you have more options as to what you do with the money. If you have been laid off or your income has been reduced, your options may be limited. Consider your financial situation and the needs of your family when deciding what to do with you COVID-19 stimulus check.  Below are five things to do with your COVID-19 Stimulus Check:  Meet basic needs  Use the money to supplement your reduced income. Since we don\u2019t know how long this pandemic and its effects will last, I would try to stretch the money out for 3-6 months. It may not be a lot, but it can make things a little more bearable.  Save it  If you don\u2019t need to supplement your income, add to your emergency fund (a little light humor \u2013 wait, this is an emergency!).  Continue to build your savings, as we are seeing, life is so uncertain.  Pay down debt  With your basic needs being met, and you\u2019re putting money in your savings, the next thing you can do is tackle your debt.  If you\u2019re able, pay a credit card off, reduce your balance to 30% or less, of your credit limit.  If you have any loans, see if you can pay a little extra toward the principle.  Whatever you can do to reduce your overall debt helpful \u2013 every little bit helps.  Start investing in your financial future  There are several online platforms that will allow you to get started with very little money.  This is an opportunity to get your feet wet, and learn.  These platforms are good for beginning investors, and a way to build your confidence and comfort level.  Taking these small investing steps are steps to securing your financial future.  Invest in yourself  This may be a good time to learn a new skill; take an online course that may increase your marketability, position you to get a better job, or allow you to start a side hustle of your own.  Choose something that will enrich your life, and will add value.  The COVID-19 stimulus checks may not be a lot, but it is a small windfall for many.  You should be strategic in planning how you will use the money.  Allow this money to lighten your financial burden, and start you on a trajectory to a better financial life.  Make it count. ",
    "Should I defer payments on my bills?": " The pros and cons of deferring payments during the COVID-19 crisis  As you look for help to make ends meet, you may be looking at the increasing amount of creditors offering the ability to delay payments. It\u2019s great companies are taking quick action to help with the financial impact of COVID-19. But proceed with caution and consider the following three things before making a decision:   Your financial situation now  Your possible financial situation in the future What happens after the deferral period ends  Your financial situation now  Understandably, if you can\u2019t cover your expenses, the only option may be to delay payments. One of the biggest mistakes I saw people making during the last recession was not quickly reducing their spending. Start cutting non-essential expenses: cable, your cellphone package, etc.  The other mistake I saw people making was not calling creditors before the first missed payment. Creditors are far more likely to work with you if you call them  before  you miss a payment. Explain to your creditors how you are impacted by COVID-19 and ask for COVID-19 hardships programs. Most creditors and lenders have hardship programs, but programs specific to COVID-19 may be better. Ask about:  The effects on your credit score (ideally none) when you delay payments How long you can defer (creditors may extend deferrals if COVID-19 continues to spread) What happens once your start repayment  Your financial situation in the future   Even if you can pay your expenses, it may make sense to defer your payments. If you are paying expenses through savings and are facing a layoff or have little in savings, carefully consider accepting options to delay payments. Delaying payments frees up cash so you can save money. As mentioned before, ask about programs specifically for those impacted by COVID-19.  Is it worth it?  All payment deferrals will impact you. The key is understanding the impact and deciding if it\u2019s worth it.  The ability to miss payments is not free money. You will have to pay it back. How you pay it back depends on your creditors. Contact your creditors and ask what happens after the missed payment period ends. The COVID-19 crisis changes the rules, but in general, there are typically four possibilities that can occur once your deferral period is over:  Your creditors add your missed payments to the end of your payment period. So if you missed three payments, your total payment period would be three months longer. Your loan is modified. This can mean a higher interest rate or an extended payment period. You temporarily pay a higher amount. This higher amount is your regular payment plus a portion of the payments you missed until you have \u201cpaid off\u201d your missed payments.  Your creditor may ask for the total missed payments to be paid in full once your deferral period ends.  The last thing you want is to find yourself in a worse financial position because you accepted an offer to defer payments without knowing the consequences after your deferral period ends. Get all the facts so you can make an informed decision.  ",
    "California Residents: Top 5 Things to Know About the Latest Stimulus": " With the second stimulus bill now in action, let\u2019s make sure you get the stimulus money you\u2019re eligible for! If you\u2019re a California resident, there\u2019s some key information you need to know. (But if you\u2019re not, make sure to read  Beyond the Check: How the Second Stimulus Bill Will Benefit You .)  The coverage can be confusing. So to get all the money that\u2019s due to you, take advantage of the changes from the new stimulus bill, and maximize your tax refund, there are five key pieces of information that pertain specifically to Californians.  1. Earned Income Tax Credit: CalEITC  Do you want to know more about how the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) can help your family this year?  The great news is, more families are eligible for the CalEITC this year. And the federal EITC has made it easier to get a larger rebate. When filing your 2020 tax return, you\u2019ll have the option of using your 2019 income to claim an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC). This change ensures that families who lost employment income in 2020 don\u2019t lose eligibility for EITC and CTC or have their EITC/CTC payments reduced.   In California, ITIN filers and their families are also now eligible to receive the EITC.   Tip : For help, visit  caleitc4me.org .  2. Stimulus check  Have you received a stimulus payment this month?  If you\u2019ve heard about the stimulus check, but thought, \u201cI probably won\u2019t qualify,\u201d take another look. A  recent poll of SaverLife members  showed that 8% mistakenly thought they weren\u2019t due a check for inaccurate reasons such as not paying taxes or receiving government benefits. Just because you haven\u2019t gotten a check, direct deposit, or EIP card yet doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t  due a payment . But you may have to file your 2020 taxes to receive it \u2014 even if you earned $0 in 2020.   Tip : We wrote about eligibility for the second federal stimulus  here .  In fact, you may be eligible to receive a stimulus check from the federal government  and  from the State of California. Your household is  eligible  for a $600 payment if you qualify for the CalEITC, if you have an income below $75,000 including households with ITINs, enrolled in the CalWORKS program, receive SSI/SSP, or the Cash Assistance Program for Immigrants (CAPI). Some of these payments will start going out in mid-April, so watch out for more information.  In addition, there may be more federal funds coming your way, so keep an eye out as we update information.  3. Housing assistance  Do you need help paying rent or mortgage?   Be on the lookout for more rental assistance programs that will help both renters and landlords with payments. In the meantime, there are guidelines in place to protect tenants and homeowners during the pandemic. For instance, right now there is a ban on all COVID-related evictions in California through June 30, along with help to pay back rent. Tenants need to pay 25% of their rent each month by June 30, and declare that they had COVID related financial hardship. Keep an eye out for more information. In the meantime, learn more about what you can do to protect yourself and your family at  Housingiskey.com  and  The United Way of CA .  And if you\u2019re behind on your energy bills, visit the  California Department of Community Services & Development  to see if you qualify and to apply for help paying your bills.  4. Student loans  Are you struggling to make student loan debt payments?   Federal student loan payments are on pause through at least September 30, 2021. That date may be extended further. You may already have received notice from your student loan servicer with a notification that you need to pay, but stay tuned for more news on that front.  There is also more you can do to lower your monthly payments in the long term. This includes switching to an  income-driven repayment plan .  More good news is on the way for Californians, specifically. On July 1, 2021, in California, a Student Borrower Bill of Rights will go into effect. This Bill of Rights will help protect borrowers from predatory lenders. In the meantime, borrowers may begin to file complaints against loan servicers through  California\u2019s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation  (DFPI). And after July 1, borrowers will be able to get clearer answers from their services on repayment plans, loan forgiveness options, and how to avoid default.  5. Unemployment insurance   Have you lost your job or had your hours reduced?  Help is on the way. If you\u2019ve already received payments in the past, California\u2019s Employment Development Department ( EDD ) will automatically recalculate your payments, either online or via mail or text. What this means:   You\u2019ll receive an additional $300/week through March 13, even if you have already reached the 30-week limit from past payments. EDD will automatically recalculate and notify you. If you are self-employed or a contractor, you will need to submit proof of employment or self-employment. A new $100 per week benefit is now available through March 13 to self-employed individuals who received at least $5,000 in annual income but were eligible for regular state unemployment benefits, not Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.  Keep an eye out for notices in the mail from EDD. These notices may require immediate action to trigger these additional benefits. For information on how to file a claim,  go here . We strongly recommend you  apply online .  Note : If you have not applied for unemployment benefits before, you will need to register.   If you\u2019re experiencing difficulty with your unemployment benefits, and you are unable to resolve the issue by contacting the EDD,  try this online resource  or reach out to your  Assembly member !   Tip : EDD can also  help you look for work .  Note : You will need to  pay taxes on your unemployment income  when you file!  It\u2019s a lot of information taking the time to look into any of these areas that apply to you will pay off. We want to make sure you get the money you\u2019re eligible for, so you can come out of this pandemic in great financial shape! ",
    "If I receive unemployment insurance, are my benefits taxable?": " Unemployment benefits are  taxable income . They are subject to federal and state taxes (if your state taxes income). You can choose to withhold 10% in federal taxes from your benefits by completing a  W-4V  and giving the form to your unemployment office. Some states automatically withhold taxes; some states do not. Go to your state\u2019s unemployment website to learn how they handle state taxes. You can also make an  estimated tax payment  to the IRS quarterly. Your state agency will give you a  1099-G  that will report unemployment income and taxes paid on your unemployment income.   Everyone\u2019s tax situation is different. But the rule of thumb is to have taxes withheld now, so it\u2019s taken out in small chunks. Otherwise, you may have to make a large tax payment next year.

    "What to do if you\u2019ve been laid off due to COVID-19": " It\u2019s no secret that Americans are worried about having enough money to pay the bills. Employees have been laid off or furloughed in record numbers. The Department of Labor is reporting  17 million layoffs  as of April 9, 2020.  If you are one of these people, I am so sorry to hear that. It\u2019s hard to have finances to worry about on top of a pandemic. But all is not lost. Here are some financial tips based on recommendations from the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  (CFPB).  Create a crisis budget  Assess your financial situation and determine your money priorities. If you can\u2019t pay all your bills due to a cash shortage,  pay your living expenses first . Focus on bills like your mortgage, rent, car note, utilities, food, and medicine over any other debts, especially credit cards. These will keep a roof over your head, the lights on, and food on the table. Plus, this will keep you healthy until you can return to work.  What to do if you can\u2019t pay your bills  During these hard times, contact your creditors or landlord directly and let them know your situation.  Check your credit report to assess your creditworthiness. You may want to consider a new loan or additional credit as a bridge until you can return to work. Falling behind on your payments can have a lasting impact on your credit score, even years from now.  If you need professional guidance on a financial issue, first seek assistance from your credit union or bank. You may also want to consider finding an  Accredited Financial Counselor  (AFC) or a  HUD -approved housing counselor if you have an issue with your mortgage or servicer.  Beware of fraud  Be cautious of emails, texts, or social media posts that may be selling fake products or information about coronavirus cases. Never give out personal information over the phone like your Social Security Number.  Unemployment benefits and the CARES Act  If you\u2019ve been laid off, you may eligible for expanded benefits under the CARES Act in addition to  regular unemployment benefits .  The CARES Act creates a new temporary federal program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA). Pandemic Unemployment Assistance provides up to 39 weeks of unemployment benefits. If you receive PUA benefits, you can collect an additional $600 weekly benefit amount (WBA) under the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) program.  The bill also covers independent contractors. You may be eligible for PUA benefits if you\u2019re unemployed, partially employed, or unable to work because of the COVID-19 crisis.  Hopefully, these suggestions can guide you and your finances through this crisis. ",
    "What to Do If You Need Help Paying for Prescription Medicines": " If you\u2019ve ever been in the situation where you have to decide whether to pay for your prescription or put groceries on the table, you know how scary that can be. What many people don\u2019t know is that there are several programs that can help you pay for those prescriptions. They are called Patient Assistance Programs (PAP).   What Is a Patient Assistance Program?  PAPs are usually sponsored by the pharmaceutical companies. They are designed to help those who have no insurance or are even under insured.  But these companies aren\u2019t the only ones who offer help. Many states and non-profits have programs as well.  Who Qualifies for Patient Assistance Programs?  Qualifications can vary, but most PAPs will require you to be a permanent, legal resident of the United States or Puerto Rico. You must prove you are uninsured or your insurance doesn\u2019t cover your prescription. There are also income requirements. Since there are no standard qualifications, I recommend searching for more than one PAP to find one that can help you.  How to Find a Patient Assistance Program  The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has put together an  extensive list of PAPs . This is a good place to get started. It includes not only pharmaceutical companies, but also state programs and non-profit programs. The research team at GoodRx says if you aren\u2019t sure where to start, put the name of your prescription and \u201csavings program\u201d into your search engine. This will bring up options for you to explore.    I know personally of a woman who had a debilitating disease and was no longer able to work. She needed a drug that would cost her over $17,000 a month. Because of the Patient Assistance Program from the manufacturer, she was able to get it for free!  Before you decide not to fill your prescription because of lack of funds, look into a PAP to see if there is support available. ",

During COVID-19, that means changing how you spend and your family changing their behavior, especially when using food and utilities.  Keep Your Spending on Food in Check  I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s harder than before to control our food spending. Below are a few suggestions based on what has worked in my house:  Buy Food in Bulk and Bag the Food Yourself  Consider buying food, particularly snack food, in bulk. This may be cheaper than pre-packaged food and you just need to bag the food yourself. We do this with chips and fruit like grapes. Bagging the food myself helps me control how much each person eats and helps the food last longer.   Read more about  strategies to stretch your food dollars .   Stick to a Shopping Schedule  I create a weekly meal plan, including snacks, and I shop only once a week (I have a family of five, with three teens). My family knows that if they eat all of a food before my shopping day, they will have to wait until I shop again to get that item. To save time, shop online at your favorite grocery store and use the free curbside pickup to get your groceries. Curbside pickup saves time and money because I only buy what is on my list.  Create Rules for When and What Your Kids Eat  I found my kids ate out of boredom and thirst. I told my kids they must drink a glass of water and wait 30 minutes after eating before eating again. This rule helped to cut down on \u201cboredom\u201d eating, and our food lasts longer.  I also realized that a box of cereal only lasts a day in my home. My kids were consuming cereal for breakfast, lunch, and as a snack. I put on our refrigerator what my kids can eat for breakfast, lunch, and snacks. Limiting breakfast foods to only breakfast and including fruits or veggies with every meal helped our food last longer and helped my kids eat healthier.  Read more tips about  grocery shopping on a budget during COVID-19 .  Monitor and Limit Your Utility Bills  Like many of you, I nearly passed out when I saw the dramatic increase in our utilities. The following are changes you can make to help lower your utility bills:  Limit Shower Time  We have three teenage daughters who take long showers, so we limited shower time to 10 minutes. We put timers in their bathrooms. By the next month, we saw a difference in our water bill.  Use Fans and Keep the Thermostat Above 70 Degrees  Fans cost less than an HVAC. When our kids complained about being hot, we noticed they were wearing hoodies, and we told them to dress for summer inside the house and turn on a fan.  Contact Your Utility Provider  Ask for discounts and special programs to save money on your utility bills.  Research Utility Companies  In our area, we had multiple choices for providers and found there were cheaper services. Call different utility providers, price shop, and ask for discounts for switching services.  Other Ways of Saving  Look at spending in other areas, and see where you can lower your expense. Ask your cable, internet, phone, and insurance providers for discounts. If you have credit cards, ask for a lower interest rate.  With everything happening today, I understand how life may feel out of control. The key surviving tough season is working as a family to change your spending and your family\u2019s habits.

    "3 Strategies to Stretch Your Food Dollars": "    As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, you may have to stretch a lower income to cover regular expenses. If your income has been reduced or you have had a lot of unexpected expenses, having enough money to feed yourself and your family may be a challenge. Food is a necessity to maintain a healthy life. But other expenses may become a priority, which reduces the amount of money you can spend on groceries.  1. Eat Healthy, Hearty Foods  We need to eat regularly, not just so we don\u2019t feel hungry, but also to help us think clearly to do daily work, to stay healthy to avoid illness, and so children can learn and grow. Food that is high in protein (meats and dairy), carbohydrates (rice, pasta, and bread), and fats (whole milk and cheese) are going to fill you up and keep you going. These are better choices than fast food, chips, crackers, soda, and sweets.  2. Plan Ahead and Cook Simple Meals  When you need to stretch your food dollars, plan simple meals with few ingredients. It isn\u2019t about how many different foods you have for a meal, but about the amount of food needed to feed your household. Now may not be the time to get creative. Regularly take an inventory of the food in the cupboard so you can plan to use the ingredients that you have. Also, use fresh produce soon after purchasing so it doesn\u2019t spoil. Consider buying in bulk. You can purchase grain products such as rice, pasta, and cereals in larger quantities, so that they cost less per serving. Shop sales and, if possible, buy extra of the sale items that you regularly use. Look for  coupons  for foods you regularly buy. This takes a little extra time but can pay off with great savings.  3. Find Resources to Help  In addition to making good use of the foods you purchase, consider checking your local community for food assistance programs. There are many programs from non-profit organizations that help local residents meet their food needs.  Feeding America  is a national program that helps connect people with local food banks. When you visit the website you can search for food programs in your community.  Full Cart  is a virtual emergency food assistance center that delivers food to you. You can find an application for the program on the website. Your community may also have emergency food programs or free meal programs that are organized by faith-based organizations.   A financial shortfall could be a short or long term situation. Staying healthy is important for your well-being. Review how you manage and prepare meals and look for additional resources that will help you during this time.  ",
    "What should I do to budget if I\u2019m on unemployment?": " I\u2019m sorry to hear you are unemployed. I know for many people it has been very difficult to access unemployment benefits since the CARES Act was enacted in March 2020. On top of that, the extra $600 per month payout ended July 31, 2020. So, congratulations on breaking through the red tape. You finally have the money in your hands that you needed to pay your bills and possibly build some savings.   Whenever you have income and you want to control where your money is going, I recommend a financial plan. Set goals that are SMART: Specific Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-specific. To help achieve your smart goal(s) create a spending plan to understand what you have coming in (income) and going out (expenses). Pay yourself first at least 10% of the income and put it into building emergency savings. If you have more of a surplus after meeting your financial obligations, save even more. By using this method, you can meet your current monthly obligations and save for the future.  Hopefully, you can continue this strategy once you are re-employed sometime soon. I wish you nothing but the best in the future. ",

    "You may be eligible for a stimulus check": " [Updated as of October 2020]  If you typically don\u2019t file taxes, you have until  November 21st, 2020  to fill out the  IRS Non-Filer form  in order to be sent your stimulus check. About 12 million Americans are still eligible to receive this  $1,200 economic impact payment .  For the past month, we\u2019ve been asking SaverLife members on a weekly basis if they\u2019ve received their stimulus payment. We\u2019ve seen the number of people receiving direct deposits and physical checks has significantly increased. At the same time, the number of people who say they don\u2019t expect a stimulus payment has gone down.  What many people have discovered recently is that they\u2019re most likely eligible to receive a stimulus payment one way or another.  Want to know if you\u2019re eligible?  When we ask people why they don\u2019t think they\u2019re eligible, we see a few common myths about the stimulus payment:  21% of people we surveyed said they didn\u2019t think they would receive an economic impact payment because they don\u2019t typically file taxes. But chances are they\u2019re probably eligible! Simply fill out the  Non-Filer form  from the IRS to check your eligibility. If you receive SSI or SNAP benefits, you should still be able to receive a stimulus payment.  This is a great resource to confirm your eligibility. If you haven\u2019t filed your 2019 taxes yet but you did file your 2018 taxes, you will receive a stimulus payment. ",
    "How to Re-Imagine Your Disposable Income During a Recession": " The biggest threat to your finances during a  recession  is a reduction or loss of income. Seemingly disposable income now may be a lifeline to keep you from eviction, foreclosure, or repossession. So if you\u2019re doing okay right now, it\u2019s a good time to fortify your financial foundation. If anything in your financial picture changes, you\u2019ll have a strong enough financial foundation so you don\u2019t fall through the floor with a drop income.  Look at your disposable income and see how you can fill in financial gaps that can wreak havoc with your future.  Build Up Your Emergency Savings  The first job of disposable income is to act as a safety net to help you pay for what I call the Quad of Survival. These are essential expenses, such as:  Transportation Housing Healthcare Food  When there is instability, your priority is saving. Your goal should be to save at least three months of expenses to cover the unexpected. If you aren\u2019t sure how much you spend in a month, go on your bank\u2019s website and review your expenses over the last three months. Divide the total number by three, and use that number as your starting point. You can re-adjust over time. I know this number may seem impossible, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s starting small. Even if all you can do is $25 a month, you are now $25 a month closer to your goal. SaverLife has a lot of great  free resources  to help you save.  Rethink Major Purchases  If you\u2019re considering buying a home or a car, think about how you can continue to pay your home or car payment if your income is lost or reduced. You may need to postpone or significantly lower your purchase amount to an amount you can afford for a few months if you lost your job or had a reduction in income.  Revisit Your Budget  Your budget is how you\u2019ve chosen to spend your monthly income. When you face a potential drop in income, carefully review your expenses,  separating your needs from your wants . I found it wasn\u2019t the significant $1,000 expenses that hurt someone financially; it was the $1, $5, and $10 purchases that slowly dug a hole in their finances.  Reduce and Pay Down Debt  If you have money saved and are sticking to a monthly budget, consider using some of your disposable income to  reduce debt . Paying down your debt lowers your expenses, meaning you need less money to cover costs if you experience a drop in income. Please note: If you face a pending layoff or significant income cut, then your #1 goal is to boost your savings, not accelerate your debt payoffs.  ***  Re-imaging your disposable income in a recession comes down to timeless financial principles: saving, budgeting, and paying off debt. The key is consistency. The more you follow sound financial principles, the easier it becomes to deal with the unexpected, and the quicker you can bounce back from financial hardships.  ",
    "Beyond the Check: How the Second Stimulus Bill Will Benefit You": " There has been a ton of news coverage about the second round of stimulus payments. Whether or not you\u2019ve received a stimulus check, there\u2019s more to the bill that could potentially benefit you.  You probably don\u2019t have time to read the 500+ pages of legislation, so we\u2019ve done that for you. This post is a good overview of the elements of the law that might apply to you. And stay tuned, because in the coming weeks, we\u2019ll be providing more information and resources as they come out.  For now, we\u2019ve separated everything about the stimulus bill into:  Actions you should take  immediately Things you should do  soon Policies and programs that may benefit you  in the future  Actions to take right now  The last stimulus payments were made on January 15th. If yours was direct deposited or added to your Economic Impact Payment Card, you\u2019ve already received it. If it\u2019s coming in the mail as a check, you may not have gotten it yet. Check your mail or your EIP card to see if you have received it.   Tip : You can check the status of your payment using the  IRS Get My Payment tool .  If you already have food stamp (SNAP) benefits, you\u2019re eligible for a 15% higher benefit limit, which you\u2019ll receive automatically. Note that there may be a delay of up to a month. This increase is good through June 30, 2021, so if you\u2019ve been considering applying for SNAP benefits, now\u2019s the time.  SNAP eligibility has also been extended to cover college students who are eligible for a federal or state work study program or with an expected family contribution of zero.

If you\u2019re a small business owner or sole proprietor needing extra economic support, you may be eligible to apply for a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan and an Economic Injury Disaster Loan ( EIDL ) through the Small Business Administration (SBA). However, you can\u2019t use the PPP loan for the same purpose as the EIDL. Find out more about all of your options  here . Note that the rules around loan forgiveness have changed, so  familiarize yourself with those .   Tip : The SBA has a hotline to answer questions: 1-800-659-2955, 7 days a week from 7:00am to 9:00pm. The SBA also offers free local advice, including info on the EIDL advance. Find a local partner  here .  Actions to take soon  In the coming weeks, there are a few more actions you can proactively take to make the most of the new stimulus law.   The most important action is to file your taxes. If you qualify for a stimulus payment, but it has not been issued by January 15th, you\u2019ll need to file your 2020 taxes in order to receive it. Our last article, \u201c Have You Received Your Second Stimulus Payment Yet? \u201d will give you more information about your eligibility.   Filing your taxes may also enable you to receive a tax refund and/or Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which can be helpful. For 2020, the government is allowing you to claim the EITC based on your 2019 income. If you\u2019ve lost income this year, you may be able to use this to get a larger tax refund. SaverLife estimates that 49% of our members should use the EITC lookback to get a larger tax refund, so there\u2019s a high likelihood this applies to you!  Note : Mixed-immigration status families are eligible for the second stimulus payment and retroactively eligible for the first one! If you\u2019re eligible but haven\u2019t received it, you\u2019ll need to file your taxes to receive it.  Tip : If the idea of filing your taxes is intimidating, consider that many people qualify for free brand-name tax prep software.  Check out this article  on how to file your taxes for free.  A word of warning: Many services offer your tax refund earlier in exchange for a fee or a percent of your refund. These products can cause problems, particularly if you miscalculate your anticipated refund and get a loan for more than you\u2019re due \u2014 in which case, you will owe the service money! You also get less money at the end of the day, of course, because these services often have predatory terms of service with high fees. SaverLife wants to make sure you maximize your tax refund instead of paying some of it to a rapid refund or refund anticipation loan company.  Actions to take later  There are also a few things from the stimulus bill you can keep in mind as the year goes along. You don\u2019t necessarily need to take immediate action, but these may be items for your to-do list at some point.  Student loan debt  The federal student loan moratorium has now been extended to September 30, 2021. You may have already received or will soon receive notice from your student loan servicer that it\u2019s time to pay. And there may be  more  you can do to lower your monthly payments, including switching to income-driven repayment plans.  Rental and mortgage assistance  As housing assistance programs roll out, review your housing and rent status. An eviction moratorium has now been extended through March 31, 2021. We\u2019re waiting to hear more about how to apply for these programs, but you may be eligible for the new rental assistance program if:  you\u2019re behind on rent you make 50% or less of your area median income and you have been unemployed for 90 or more days  It\u2019s a good idea to communicate with your landlord or bank to make payment arrangements if you may need extra time or help.  Internet access  Keep an eye out for broadband access opportunities. You may be able to receive better or cheaper internet access soon. We\u2019ll update you as more details become available.  Pell grants  The Federal Pell Grant is typically awarded to undergraduates who have a high degree of unmet financial need. Within this stimulus bill, eligibility for Pell grants has been extended, with wider income eligibility. Additionally, if you previously couldn\u2019t qualify because you were incarcerated, had a drug conviction, or had used up your Pell grant for a for-profit college that has closed, you may now be eligible.  ***  We\u2019ll post again next week with California-specific policies for residents of that state. And if you\u2019re not a Californian, stay tuned for more updates on the latest stimulus bill soon. ",
    "Tips for Managing Your Debt in Case of a Recession": " It is important to consider any financial goal, including eliminating debt, in the context of your overall financial well-being. What are your priorities?  What is your financial picture now and in the future?  With a recession comes more uncertainty. What you choose to do will depend on your circumstances. Generally, the foundation for financial health is to get your financial house in order. This is not usually a linear process. It involves:  resolving any pressing financial issues making sure you can cover your essentials (e.g., housing, food, utilities) without going into debt having enough of an emergency fund to cover your living expenses should an emergency arise  Debt is and can feel like a huge burden. When you are in debt, your money is tied up and the debt is costing you interest and probably some stress. Normally, it makes a lot of sense to eliminate your debt as soon as possible. However, during (or pending) a recession, you may want to allocate your resources differently. Now is a good time to focus on stability with your cash flow and security with savings.  Of course, it is prudent to pay your bills in full and on time if you have the means to do so. Stay on track with your debt as best you can. But, now might not be the best time to concentrate on reducing debt due to further financial impacts of COVID-19. Stay in control of your finances during these uncertain times by holding steady with your debt, managing your cash flow, and buffering your savings. ",
    "Stimulus Checks Are Rolling In": " Here\u2019s some good news from last week: people are finally receiving their stimulus checks!

We call that progress!  It took a collective effort, but the IRS was finally able to provide people with the necessary tools to help them receive checks in a timely manner.

    "8 Tips for Financial Planning During an Economic Downturn": " It\u2019s difficult to create a solid financial plan when the economy is booming. Add an economic downturn and creating a financial plan can seem impossible. Here are eight tips for financial planning during a downturn that can help you stay the course.  1. Be Sure You\u2019re Thinking Clearly  It\u2019s easy to give in to panic during a downturn. In order to make good decisions though,  you need to think clearly . Give yourself a cooling off period before you make decisions to be sure you\u2019re making them with a level head. Wait a day or talk your worries over with someone. Just be sure when you make a decision you are coming from a place of logic and information, not a place of emotion.  2. Get Everyone on the Same Page  Take some time to  get your family on the same page about your finances . What are your short-term goals and priorities? What are you working towards in the long-term? If everyone knows the end goal, making small changes during a downturn can be less difficult.  3. Create A Bare-Bones Budget  A key step towards successful financial planning, no matter what the economy is doing, is knowing exactly how much you need to get by. A bare-bones budget can help. A bare-bones budget covers all of your needs. Once you know how much  your needs  cost, you can add back in wants if there is money left over. Having this lower limit will help you see exactly what your expenses are and how you can cover them. Listing out your expenses can also help you find ways to cut back if needed.  4. Re-Evaluate Your Priorities  As the economy changes, sometimes our goals and priorities have to change too. It is okay during a downturn to prioritize meeting your necessary expenses and paying down debt over other financial goals. Shifting money to these two areas can help you have peace of mind knowing your bills are covered. It can also help you save money by  paying down debts  so they will accrue less interest. Paying your debts can also free up money in the budget for other goals as you pay them off.  5. Take Advantage of Dollar Cost Averaging  Dollar cost averaging is an investing philosophy where you invest the same amount of money into a stock or fund at set intervals (monthly, semi-annually, or annually). It is nearly impossible to actually time the market and buy low and sell high. Staying consistent with dollar cost averaging allows you to buy more shares when the price is low and while you buy less when the price is high. This helps remove some of the variability of the market.    6. Think Long-Term  It can be hard during an economic downturn to plan for the future. When things feel so uncertain, the tendency can be to shut down. This is when it is helpful to remember long-term trends. The economy won\u2019t always be in a downturn and when things turn around, having plans in place to get where you want to go will be helpful. So be sure to keep the big picture in mind!  7. Stay Organized  It is always important to keep your financial life organized. But this is doubly important during an economic downturn. Knowing when money is coming in and when you have to pay bills is crucial to sticking to your budget. Track your income and expenses in a way that makes sense to you. But know where everything is and when it is due! Some tracking methods I\u2019ve seen work well for people are budgeting apps or Excel or Google Sheets. If there are multiple people in your household managing money, I recommend a tracking method you can share to help you stay organized.  8. Never Stop Learning  One big thing you can do during a downturn, or anytime, to help your financial plan stay strong is to always keep learning. The more you know about personal finance and financial planning the better prepared you will be in good times and in bad. To keep the cost low for learning, check out personal finance books from your local library, listen to podcasts, or find blogs to read.    Even though it is hard during a downturn, you can still make a financial plan and work to stick to it. Stay calm and remember that progress comes from small actions repeated over time! ",
    "Make a Powerful Plan for Your Tax Refund & Stimulus Check": " We are in the thick of tax season, and the House recently approved a  new stimulus bill . This is great news for many people, especially considering the average tax refund is around $2,500, and the expected stimulus check for a four-person household is up to $5,600. If you missed a previous stimulus payment, filing taxes allows you to receive the funds through the Recovery Rebate Credit. Many households are going to receive large sums of money.  What can you do to make this money work for you? Here are some powerful plans for your tax refund and stimulus check.  1. Debt Reduction  It has been a very rough year. The hardships created by the pandemic have caused Americans to lean more on credit cards. Using your refund and stimulus payments to chip away at debts that the pandemic may have caused is an excellent idea. The average credit card interest rate is around 16%. By getting rid of this debt, you are kicking both the balance and interest to the curb.  2. Budget for the Year  Weave the funds into your budget to reduce the burden of day-to-day living expenses throughout the year. This could be used toward specific budget items, for example, paying some of your rent in advance. You could also use it to inject extra money for whatever you need monthly. To do this, simply divide your lump sum by 12 and transfer that amount into your checking account each month.  3. Build Your Emergency Fund  If the pandemic has taught us nothing else, it\u2019s the importance of being prepared for the completely unexpected. An emergency fund is the safety net you need for the unknown. A good goal for an emergency fund is 6 months of household expenses. Don\u2019t stress if you aren\u2019t there yet; you will likely need to build up to your goal over time. Using these lump sums of money will certainly put you closer to achieving this goal.  4. Save for Retirement  Building retirement savings is key for your future. Consider contributing to a retirement account, such as a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are post-tax retirement accounts available through investment companies, banks, and credit unions. I recommend comparing fees and investment options when seeking a new IRA account. Using the average tax refund as an example, investing a one-time $2,500 lump sum with an 8% annual rate of return would turn into almost $37,000 for someone who is 35 years away from retirement.  5. Contribute to a 529 Plan  A child with just $500 saved for their college education is three times more likely to attend college than a child with no college savings. A 529 Plan is a type of investment account similar to an IRA, but the money is earmarked to help cover future education expenses. Each state has a plan through the State Treasurer\u2019s Office or offers a different state\u2019s plan. Although you can use any state\u2019s plan, there may be state income tax benefits for using the plan belonging to your state of residence. Investing just $265 one-time for a 5-year-old child with a 5% annual rate of return would provide $500 for their college expenses when they reach age 18.   A powerful plan starts with reviewing your household\u2019s current financial situation and anticipated changes. By looking at your situation and comparing the options, you can determine what powerful plan options will work best for you and your family. The right plan may be only one of these options, but it also may combine everything I\u2019ve discussed. Having your powerful plan in place before receiving the lump sums will ensure the money doesn\u2019t get spent on things you have not prioritized as important.  Haven\u2019t started filing your taxes yet? Don\u2019t wait! The United Way has a free tax tool for those with W-2s called  MyFreeTaxes . You can also locate a  Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program  in your area through the IRS. ",
    "What\u2019s in the Third Stimulus Bill Other than Checks?": " While the third stimulus payment \u2014  which we just wrote about  \u2014 is a hot topic for Americans right now, there\u2019s actually a lot more to the  American Rescue Plan . Here are some of the additional benefits you could get from the relief package.   Additional Support to Families  In addition to stimulus payments, the American Rescue Plan helps families with three types of tax credits: a Child Tax Credit (CTC), the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and tax credits for child or dependent care.   Child Tax Credit (CTC)  Eligible families can receive more money through the Child Tax Credit than before. For one year, the American Rescue Plan  raises the CTC  from a baseline of $2,000 to:  $3,600 for each child under age 6 $3,000 for each child between ages 6-17   The plan also sends more money to families who have seen a loss of income. Even if families have earned no income this year, they can still receive the full benefit. Families can receive these funds as fully refundable tax credits \u2014 meaning that the government will give you back more money than you may owe in taxes.    Note : The payments could go out monthly or periodically instead of annually, starting in July. It\u2019s a good idea to watch for updates!   Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)   The American Rescue Plan expands the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) eligibility to help more low- to moderate-income workers and families through the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Workers without children will see substantial benefits. Previously, the lower age limit for childless workers to qualify was 25; that changes to 19 with the American Rescue Plan. There is no upper age limit anymore, and the amount of the credit also goes up substantially for childless workers \u2014 it triples! That means the maximum could be $1,502 (instead of $543) for one year.   This year, there is a special rule (called the \u201c lookback rule \u201d) in place that allows you to get the most EITC that you can. When filing your taxes, you can use either your 2020 or 2019 income \u2014 whichever will give you the most money back in your tax refund.   Tip : Talk to a  tax preparer  about the lookback option, and keep your 2019 records available.  Child and Dependent Care Tax Credits (CDCTC)   Eligible families will get help paying for child and dependent care this year through expanded Child and Dependent Care Tax Credits. In addition to more funds, the CDCTC will be fully refundable, meaning that these are refunds that could come back to you in the form of a check or payment from the IRS.  Read more details.

    "Have You Received Your Second Stimulus Payment Yet?": " If you\u2019re like most people, the word  stimulus  makes you perk up your ears these days. Perhaps you\u2019ve either already received or eagerly await that much-needed payment, which will arrive by a deposit in your bank account, a check in the mail, or an  Economic Impact Payment Card .\u00a0  With the second stimulus bill now in action, let\u2019s make sure you get the stimulus money you\u2019re eligible for! The coverage can be confusing, so here are some key pieces of information you need to know.  An overview of the second stimulus payment  The U.S. government passed a second COVID-related stimulus bill in late December 2020, which included a second round of stimulus payments to U.S. residents who qualify. The standard amount of the payment is $600 per adult and $600 per child 16-years-old or younger. There is no limit on the number of children in a family who can receive the payment. So, for instance, a family of four can receive up to $2,400.  However, individuals and families phase out of the stimulus payment window once they reach a certain income. The limit to receive the full stimulus amount is:  $75,000 for a single person $112,500 for Head of Household $150,000 for Married Filing Jointly  In addition, depending on your income, you may not qualify for the full amount. To check your eligibility and amount, use the  IRS Get My Payment tool  or  this great tool from Kiplinger .  Note:  Mixed immigration status families can now receive stimulus payments! You should automatically receive both payments \u2014 the one from earlier this year as well as the most recent one. But if you don\u2019t get the payments, you need to file your taxes to receive them.  When should I expect my payment?  As of this writing, the IRS had distributed nearly  80 percent of payments . After Friday, January 15th, there will be no more payments for this round.\u00a0  The IRS is only able to distribute payments to people already in their system who they define as eligible. But part of that eligibility is based on how you filed 2019 taxes. If your status has changed, you may be owed a stimulus payment that you won\u2019t see until you file your 2020 taxes. More on that in a bit.\u00a0  Tip:  Did you know you can sign up to receive an email every day letting you know what mail is on the way with  Informed Delivery \u00ae  by USPS \u00ae ?\u00a0  Tip:  If you receive veterans\u2019 benefits or Social Security payments on your Direct Express card, you can also check the status of your payment  here  and learn more about receiving your payments.  What if I haven\u2019t received my stimulus payment?  If you received the first stimulus payment via check or debit card, make sure you check all your mail and don\u2019t throw anything away without opening it. Not all envelopes will be clearly marked.  Unfortunately, if you have moved since you received the first payment, there is no way to update your mailing address at this time. You must instead file your 2020 taxes to get the stimulus check.  Tip:  If you have moved, make sure to  update your address  for any future payments!\u00a0  If you received the first stimulus check via direct deposit, you should expect the second via direct deposit as well. But if you have since closed the bank account that the IRS has on file for you, there is no way to update this information at this time. Again, you must file your 2020 taxes to get the stimulus check.  Another wrinkle: During the first round of stimulus payments, if the IRS didn\u2019t have your information on file in order to send you a check, you were able to add it using their online too. Unfortunately, for this round, it\u2019s not an option.  Tip:  If the  IRS Get My Payment tool  gives you the message \u201cPayment Status #2 \u2013 Not Available,\u201d you must file your taxes to get your stimulus check.  Tip : Be on the lookout for a text message asking for details of your bank account. This is a  scam ! You don\u2019t have to disclose your bank account details to the IRS or anyone else to receive your stimulus money.\u00a0  How do I claim my stimulus payment when I file my taxes?  So if you\u2019ve moved, changed banks, or received the message\u00a0 \u201cPayment Status #2 \u2013 Not Available\u201d with the IRS tool \u2014\u00a0or if you haven\u2019t received your stimulus payment by January 15th \u2014 don\u2019t worry. You can still receive it once you file your taxes.  Note, too, that if your tax situation has changed since you last filed in 2019, you must file to get any additional stimulus that is owed to you. Here are a few reasons this might apply to you:  You had a baby in 2020 and now qualify for an additional $600 based on this \u201cdependent\u201d You made less money in 2020 than 2019, so you now qualify for the stimulus based on your 2020 income  One last important thing to know: if you are also claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or Child Tax Credit (CTC), your entire refund, including your stimulus payment, will be delayed until at least March. But you should file anyway \u2014\u00a0there is a lot of money on the table!  We\u2019ll share more news soon about other important updates you should know about from the stimulus bill (there was a lot in there!). In the meantime, with tax season quickly approaching, be sure to get proactive about stimulus #2. ",
    "What Is the Recovery Rebate Credit?": " The COVID 19 pandemic has impacted our lives quite a bit. It has even changed our tax forms by adding a tax credit. The Recovery Rebate Credit was authorized by the CARES Act. Many of us received all or part of it in advance in the form of an  Economic Impact Payment . And the Consolidated Appropriations Act passed in December of 2020 provided  another Economic Impact Payment  for many of us.  As of this writing, the 2020 1040 Form and Instructions are in draft form. A version that provides reconciliation for the second round of economic impact payments has not been provided yet. However, the IRS stated that 2020 tax returns will include a Recovery Rebate Credit that covers both economic impact payments. But what does this mean?  File Your Taxes if You Didn\u2019t Receive Your Full Stimulus Payments  If you didn\u2019t receive any of the economic impact payments you were entitled to, you will be able to reconcile that on your 2020 tax return. For example, if you should have received $1200 the first time and $600 the second time \u2013 but you didn\u2019t \u2013 indicate that on your tax return. You should receive the payments as the recovery rebate credit in your tax refund. Or, if you would otherwise owe taxes, the IRS will apply the credit to your tax liability. If you added a child under 17 to your family in 2020 and didn\u2019t previously get a payment credited for the child, you can capture that when you file your taxes.   The recovery rebate credit makes sure if you missed any portion of the economic impact payments, you can claim that by filing your taxes. If you are having a tax professional prepare your tax return, I encourage you to bring proof that you received any economic impact payments and the amounts. They will likely ask for it. For those of you who prepare your own tax returns on software the process should be seamless. The software will ask you if you received any economic payments and how much. The software will calculate if you should receive a recovery rebate credit based on what you entered about the payments and based on the individuals listed on your tax return.  Will I Have to Pay Back My Stimulus Check If I\u2019m No Longer Eligible?  The IRS states there will be no \u201cclawback\u201d for the stimulus. If you received an economic impact payment based on a valid 2018 or 2019 tax return, but your 2020 tax return indicates you would have gotten less, you can keep the money. This has an interesting impact on parents who switch which parent claims a child each year. Consider this scenario: One parent received an economic impact payment for a child based on a 2019 tax return. The other parent claims the child for the 2020 tax return. In this case, the other parent will receive the recovery rebate credit on their 2020 tax return. Each parent can keep the payment or credit.   The economic impact payments and the recovery rebate credits are tax free. The economic impact payments will not reduce your tax refund. If you received these funds, I hope you have used or will use them to improve your financial position.  ",
    "Five Ways to Manage Financial Stress During COVID-19": " Even under the best circumstances, most of us deal with financial stress in our daily lives. With the additional stress that has been placed on many individuals and families as a result of COVID-19 from job loss or changes in income, and uncertainty about the future, financial worries are even more common. Dealing with your finances at a time like this can be completely overwhelming. Here are a few strategies to help you manage your money worries right now.  Track Your Spending  Often when you\u2019re faced with financial stress, the last thing you feel like doing is creating a budget. But this is almost always the first step towards stress management. Take the time to write all of your expenses down. Break them into fixed expenses (those you can\u2019t change) and flexible expenses (those you can change or cut). This can help give you a complete picture of your financial health. Use real numbers for your budget as much as possible. You can do this by looking at past spending and your monthly bills. Creating an accurate budget will give you the best gauge of your actual financial situation. It can also help you determine the lowest amount of money you need to get by.  Cut Expenses Where You Can  Once you have created a budget, it\u2019s time to get to work on making changes where you can. Are there services you are paying for (such as the gym) but aren\u2019t using either because they are closed, or you\u2019ve currently made other arrangements? Contact these companies and see if you can suspend or cancel your membership for now. If you are having trouble paying bills, contact your service providers to see if there are any suspension options currently in place as a result of the pandemic. Be sure that you understand the terms of these programs and when payments will resume.    Find Resources in Your Area  It can be helpful in times of financial stress to know you aren\u2019t alone. If you are having trouble paying your bills, securing food, or need other services, find resources in your area that you can turn to for help. Look for food assistance programs and healthcare resources locally or at your state level. Reach out for community assistance in paying utility bills with your local community or utility company. There are so many resources out there that can provide help and relief. Become familiar with  what is available in your community .  Avoid Retail Therapy  When we\u2019re sad or stressed, we often look for quick emotional boosts. For some people, this means spending money. This can be an expensive habit, and when money is already causing stress it can make a budget go off the rails. Now may be a good time to curb this habit to keep more money in your pocket. If you find yourself browsing online out of boredom or spending money you normally wouldn\u2019t just to feel better, avoiding the temptation to shop may be helpful. One good step to take is to hide or delete shopping apps from your mobile devices. This can remove the temptation and help you save your money for necessary expenses.  Find Someone to Talk To  Feeling stressed and worried about money can be a very isolating. If you are struggling with your finances during this time, finding someone to talk to might help. You can speak to a trusted friend or family member, a member of your religious community, or find an Accredited Financial Counselor\u00ae that you can speak to about your worries and concerns.  Having someone to share your stresses with can lighten the load. It can also provide outside perspective and help you find solutions to your problems. SaverLife is also partnering with TrustPlus to offer  free financial coaching  to all members during this crisis.  Times like these can really highlight the stresses in life, and the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly put a focus on personal finance. These are just five things you can do to help manage and mitigate the financial stress that you are experiencing. There are many other ways to manage financial stress. The key is to find the right solution for you!   ",
    "Applying for SNAP Benefits if You\u2019re Newly Unemployed": " If you\u2019ve lost work or earnings, you may be curious about programs that you can use during this difficult time. Your first move should be to apply for unemployment insurance. This is likely the most valuable benefit, especially while the additional $600/week is available through late July 2020.  Unemployment insurance often replaces only a portion of your income. You may also qualify for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) to help cover the cost of feeding yourself and your family. SNAP is a federal program that provides nutrition benefits to low-income families to help them purchase food. If your income has declined, SNAP benefits may help you through this uncertain time.  How do you apply for SNAP benefits?  SNAP is a federal program, but it\u2019s administered at the state or county level. You need to apply in the state where you live. Some states have re-named the program: for example, CalFresh in California or Basic Food in Washington. You can find  information for each state\u2019s program .  In response to the COVID-19 crisis, many states have:  Made it easier for people to apply for benefits  Extended the certification periods for re-affirming eligibility  Temporarily increased benefit levels up to the maximum allotment based on family size  Additionally, the federal government suspended the three-month time limit on receiving SNAP benefits for unemployed adults without dependent children.   What information do you need to apply for SNAP benefits?  There are a few important things to know about the application for SNAP benefits. The application will ask you to define your household side. For this program, your household is as all the people who live with you and prepare food with you. If you have a roommate, but you shop and cook separately, you are a single-person household.  In most states, you\u2019ll need to follow up your SNAP application by providing supporting documentation of your:  identity residence immigration and citizenship status income expenses  Income and asset limits for SNAP benefits  The application will ask for both your gross monthly income and your net monthly income. In most cases, you  have to meet both requirements to qualify. SNAP counts income from all sources, including earnings, unemployment insurance, cash benefits, and child support.  Currently for a one-person household gross monthly income is limited to $1,354 and net monthly income is limited to $1,041. For a family of four these are raised to a gross monthly income of $2,790 and $2,146 net monthly income. (Please note that these amounts are higher in Alaska and Hawaii.)  If your household income is under the gross monthly income limit, you should apply. As you apply, you\u2019ll figure out your net income, which factors in deductions and taxes. This is important because it allows you to subtract out a portion of your biggest expenses like the housing, utilities, and medical costs. Medical expenses for the SNAP program are broad. They include any costs for prescriptions, medical equipment, doctor\u2019s visits, and dental appointments not covered by other programs. These costs are excluded because paying these necessary expenses leaves less money in the budget for food.   In some states, the application also asks about assets. You can exclude your house and your first car. The program may request information on any other cars and other assets you may own, like savings accounts.  Receiving and using SNAP benefits  After you submit an application and are deemed eligible for benefits, you\u2019ll receive an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card. The dollar value of your benefits are automatically added to your account each month. The EBT card works just like a debit card, but with limitations on its use. You can use it to purchase groceries at any authorized store or retailer (in some places, this includes farmers markets).  You can use your EBT card to buy:  fruits and vegetables meat, poultry, and fish dairy products breads, cereals, and other snack foods non-alcoholic beverages seeds and plants that could produce food for the household  You\u2019re not able to use your benefits to buy:  alcohol of any kind tobacco products vitamins, medicines, and supplements live animals prepared foods (that you could immediately consume) or hot foods any non-food items  When you receive your benefits, you will also receive notification that lets you know how long you will receive benefits. This is your certification period. Prior to the end of your certification period, you will be notified to re-certify so that you can continue receiving benefits. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, many states have extended certification periods.   ",

    "What Is a Recession and How Do I Prepare for One?": " The  National Bureau of Economic Research  (NBER) is the organization that decides if the US is in a recession. They define a recession as \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\u201d So, what the heck does this mean? In a recession, companies are making less stuff because people are buying less stuff, which means companies aren\u2019t hiring as many people to make stuff, so fewer people have jobs.  Recessions are not uncommon; since 1854, the U.S. has gone into recession about once every five years. The average recession going back to the 1850s lasted for about 18 months.   During every recession (this is my third as a financial professional), the news seems to say the same thing: \u201cThis time is different,\u201d and the US economy will \u201cnever\u201d recover. The U.S. economy has survived a civil war, multiple world wars, various political climates, the Spanish Flu, and domestic attacks on our nation (Pearl Harbor and the World Trade Center attack). We can and will survive a recession.  The following are four steps you can take NOW to prepare and survive a recession.  1. Create a \u201cCrisis Budget\u201d  You create a crisis budget by listing the essential expenses you need to pay monthly to survive a drop in income- such as food, shelter, and transportation. You can exclude costs you know you will ditch if you lost your job.    2. Focus on Saving  If you are facing a loss or a drop in income, any extra money, no matter the amount, should go toward savings. SaverLife offers a ton of great resources to help you save money.  3. Contact Your Creditors  If you are facing a job loss or drop in income, call your creditors now. Contact your creditors as soon as possible to let them know of a possible change in your income, even if you can pay your bills. Creditors are more likely to work with you if you contact them before there is a problem.   4. Have Grace  At the time of this writing, our nation seems to be facing one crisis after another: COVID-19, the outcry over racial injustice, natural disasters, and a challenging election season. You throw in a job loss, and you may find your temper shorter than normal. Talk to your kids about their worries and explain any changes you may have to make. Talk to your partner because sometimes fear comes out as anger. If you are stressed, get help.  The best way to manage a recession is to manage your finances. Taking the steps above will help you manage life financially during a recession. ",
    "How Does Paid Family Leave Work?": " When money is tight and a loved one is sick, how do you decide if you should go to work or stay home to care for them? What if you are the one who is ill, and you need time to take care of yourself? Who is going to earn money to pay the everyday living expenses? No one ever wants to be in this position, but this is a real problem faced by Americans every day. That is why some states are beginning to offer paid family leave programs.  Who is Eligible for Paid Family Leave?  The United States does not have a nationwide paid family and medical leave policy.  There are, however, a few states that have adopted laws that allow employees to take a leave of absence with pay in order to care for their own health or that of an ailing loved one. These states are California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Washington, and Washington, D.C.   Each State Has a Different Paid Family Leave Mandate  Each of these states have their own mandate. There isn\u2019t a specific set of requirements that is followed by all of them. There are, however, some common components in most of them. These include:  The program is overseen by the State Funded partially by the employees Provide partial pay replacement for qualified leave Included leave reasons are similar to the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Require leave to run concurrently with FMLA (when both apply) Determine employee eligibility by work location, not home of residence.  Require documentation  Where to Find Specifics for Each State  Each state posts its annual contribution rates, taxable wage base, and maximum weekly benefit amounts. The National Partnership for Women and Families has a listing of each state and its specific requirements and conditions for receiving the paid family leave coverage.  This document  will cover information like what situations make you eligible for paid leave and the definition of a family member. It also covers the maximum length of paid leave, employee eligibility requirements, and how the insurance system is funded.    If you are lucky enough to live in a state that offers this assistance, and you find yourself in the unfortunate situation of having to leave your job to care for yourself or a loved one who is ill, this program may help you through this difficult time. Contact your HR Department for guidance through your state\u2019s program. ",
    "How the CARES Act Impacts Your Student Loans": " Times are uncertain right now. Budgets are tightening and people are losing work. On March 27, 2020 President Trump signed the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act. Now people are trying to understand how the CARES Act will affect their lives.  If you have student loans, you may wonder how the CARES Act can give you some relief and free up money for more pressing financial issues. The good news is that the CARES Act does offer help for those with federally held student loans.  What the CARES Act Does for Federal Student Loans  The CARES Act has two big impacts on federally held student loans. This means if you filled out the FAFSA and borrowed loans as a result, your loans might be affected.  The first thing that the CARES Act does is set interest on student loans to 0% through September 30, 2020. So, over the next six months, your federally held student loans will accrue no interest will accrue. Loans covered in the 0% interest rate program include:  Defaulted and non-defaulted Direct Loans Defaulted and non-defaulted FFEL Program Loans Federal Perkins Loans  Some FFEL Program Loans and some Perkins loans are not owned by the federal government but by commercial lenders or your school. If this is the case, these loans are not eligible for this benefit at this time.  The second thing that the CARES Act does is place all federally held student loans into National Emergency Forbearances. A forbearance is a temporary suspension of loan payments. In this case, the suspension runs from March 13, 2020 through September 30, 2020. During this six-month time period no payments will be due on your federal student loans. If you made a payment after March 27 and would like a refund, request one from your loan servicer.  How National Emergency Forbearance Works  Usually, for your student loans to go into forbearance, you (the borrower) must request action. However, that is not the case with National Emergency Forbearance. This program will be enacted automatically. Whether you previously had your loans on automatic payment or paid each month, no payments should be due.  You should still check the status of your loans with your servicer. If a payment is still showing up as due, reach out to your servicer.   How the Temporary Suspension Affects Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)  If you are in the  Public Service Loan Forgiveness program  (PSLF), you may be wondering how the temporary suspension will affect your progress toward the necessary 120 payments required for forgiveness. The good news is that if you were on a qualifying repayment plan for your Direct Loan prior to the suspension and work for a qualifying employer full-time during the suspension, you will receive credit during the suspension for qualifying, on-time payments towards PSLF.  Making Payments During National Emergency Forbearance  If you can make some or all of your student loan payments and would like to do so, you still can during the forbearance period. Your payments will be applied directly toward the principal once you have paid off all unpaid interest. If your loans were on automatic payment prior to the suspension you can go to your account with your servicer and make manual payments or you can ask to have automatic payment resumed.  ~  It\u2019s important to understand how the CARES Act affects your federal student loans and how it might free up money for you during this time. As budgets adjust, understanding that you have a temporary suspension on your loan payments will hopefully allow money to flow to other necessities. Just be sure that your contact information is updated with your loan servicer so you will receive the notifications to resume payments in October. And if your income changes in the fall and you are unable to make your full student loan payment, reach out to your servicer regarding an Income Based Repayment plan. ",

I recommend these  28 virtual tour opportunities  to entertain your children.

    "Know Your Rights With Your Stimulus Payment": " Amidst all the turmoil of the last month, the second stimulus bill passed, and payments were issued. By now, you should have received your payment of up to $600 per child and adult in your family \u2014  assuming you are eligible .  It\u2019s critical to know your rights with the stimulus payments. Take the time to scan this post for any areas that may apply to you. We will cover all your burning questions about how the stimulus payments affect your taxes, whether they can be garnished, how they impact child support (and vice versa), and what to do if you suspect the IRS made a mistake.  First, have you received your payment?  If you haven\u2019t seen your stimulus payment arrive yet, make sure you\u2019re looking everywhere it may show up:  Direct deposit in your bank account A check in the mail EIP (debit card) payment, also by mail  In some cases, you\u2019ll have to claim the money on your tax return in order to receive your stimulus payment. It\u2019s helpful to  know the nuances . You can track the status of your stimulus payment online via the  IRS Get My Payment tool.    Know how taxes will impact your stimulus payment  Stimulus checks are not considered taxable income. For this reason,  you do not have to pay taxes on either stimulus check .  If you did not receive the stimulus, you may still be eligible for the  Recovery Rebate Credit  when you file your taxes. Stimulus payments are based on your 2019 income. That means that if you met certain conditions in 2020, it could change your status and make you eligible:  A loss of income You were newly independent Additional dependents  In these cases, you might receive additional money when you file your 2020 tax return.  Tip : For more information on how to file a tax return to receive stimulus funds you are due, read  Resources to Help You File Your Taxes for Free and Maximize Your Tax Refund .  What to know about debt collection  Stimulus money is yours. Don\u2019t give it away to a scam or a debt collector who is pressuring you to pass the cash along. Here\u2019s what you need to know about debt collection when it comes to your stimulus payment.  Private debt collectors, including student loan servicers and landlords, cannot withhold or claim funds from your stimulus payment.  Similarly, if you owe the state or government money for any reason, it cannot be garnished from your stimulus payment. (Read more about this  straight from the IRS .) However, note that these funds can be withheld from your potential tax credit, once you file your taxes.  Banks also have the right to use deposited stimulus funds to cover overdraft fees  \u2014 although not all banks are choosing to do so. If this happens to you, contact your bank and request a temporary waiver; they don\u2019t have to grant it, but they may.  It\u2019s still a smart financial practice to be aware of any judgments against you. Here is how to check:  Download your credit report Check to see if you have a federal tax lien by calling the IRS: 1-800-913-6050 (or ask your tax preparer to call on your behalf) Check with your state tax board or county recorder about other potential liens   While it may be extra challenging right now, paying your bills and taxes on time, to the best of your ability, will help prevent future liens.  How child support impacts your stimulus payment  When the first round of stimulus checks was released, the IRS sent \u201ccatchup payments\u201d to any spouse who had filed for past-due child support, deducting that amount from the stimulus payments of the spouse who owed. This policy has changed for the second stimulus payment. Your past-due child support cannot be garnished (deducted) from your second stimulus check.   What to do if you suspect the IRS made a mistake  Sometimes, the IRS makes mistakes. Recently, the IRS  goofed on the stimulus payments  of millions of Americans who used tax preparers such as Turbo Tax, Jackson Hewitt, and H&R Block. This massive error left a lot of people wondering where their stimulus payments were. On January 10th, the IRS said that it is reissuing some payments that were sent to the wrong bank accounts.  This is a good reminder that it\u2019s smart to regularly monitor your bank account for deposits and other activity.  Tip : As an alternative to IRS tools, there are plenty of calculators available to determine whether you should have received a stimulus payment, and for how much, including  this one .  It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s also possible for the IRS to mistakenly make a payment to someone who is not actually eligible. It happened in the first round of stimulus payments, and it probably happened in the second round as well. Read more about the circumstances where you might need to  return your stimulus payment .   Protect your stimulus check  Stimulus payments are designed to help Americans with basic bills during a challenging time \u2014 putting food on the table or a roof over your head.

    "I haven\u2019t filed my taxes in recent years. Can I still receive a stimulus check?": " The U.S. government has just started disbursing the stimulus checks it promised to millions of Americans. Questions still linger for many, including whether they need to submit new information in order to get that money.  The government will calculate the  amount of money you receive  based on your adjusted gross income on your 2019 tax return. If you haven\u2019t turned in your 2019 tax return yet, it will be based on your 2018 return. However, some people may not have filed a return for either of those years. Meanwhile, others who have low income may have never filed.  The IRS and Treasury Department clarified this week that Social Security beneficiaries will not have to file a tax return in order to get their payments. That is because those people typically receive a 1099 form the government will use instead.  According to the latest information from the IRS, non-filers should use the  Enter Payment Info tool . This tool allows you to provide the government with your preferred payment method. ",
    "Time-Sensitive Steps to Receive Your Stimulus Payment Quickly": " The IRS  announced  that this Wednesday, May 13th, 9am PT (noon ET) is the deadline for many people to enter their direct deposit info into their  Get My Payment  portal. If you  qualify for a stimulus payment  and haven\u2019t received it yet, provide your direct deposit information to get your funds faster.  Who needs to provide their direct deposit information?  Wednesday\u2019s deadline seems to only apply if you filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return, but didn\u2019t include direct deposit information. If you miss this deadline, you\u2019ll still receive your payment if you qualify. It will come via check sometime in the next few months.  What if I\u2019m not required to file taxes?  Even if you\u2019re not required to file taxes, you can still expedite your stimulus payment. Just enter your direct deposit info into the  Non-Filer: Enter Payment Info Here  tool. So far, the IRS hasn\u2019t set a deadline for non-filers to enter their payment info.  You aren\u2019t required to file a tax return if your annual income was less than $12,200 ($24,400 if filing jointly). Even if it\u2019s not required by law, it may benefit you to file your taxes anyway. You may qualify for refundable tax credits like the EITC or the Additional Child Tax Credit and receive a refund.   It\u2019s also important for young adults who are newly financially independent of their parents to file taxes. This will establish your \u201cindependent\u201d status with the IRS. Even if your parents help you out financially, if you\u2019re 19-24, the IRS likely sees you as independent. The main exception is full-time students whose parents pay more than half of their expenses.  How to File Your Taxes for Free  If you\u2019re eligible for the stimulus payment and haven\u2019t filed your 2019 tax returns, I recommend that you do so as soon as possible. When you file, be sure to include your direct deposit info. If your income is $69,000 or less, you can use brand-name tax prep software for free through  IRS Free File . Code for America is also partnering with free tax prep sites to offer  help from IRS-certified volunteers  for free.

    "How COVID-19 is impacting SaverLife members": " Spending is down, saving is up  As the nation continues to shelter in place, it comes as no surprise that spending on \u201cfun\u201d items and activities has decreased. This includes gym memberships, going to the movies, and eating out.  In order to make sure they have enough cash on hand to weather the storm, SaverLife members are even cutting back on paying down their existing debt.   In years past, March has typically been the month that healthcare spending picks up. People finally have their tax refund and they\u2019re able to pay for medical expenses that they may have been putting off.  Healthcare spending looks a bit different this year.

    "What to expect when you apply for unemployment during COVID-19": " I\u2019m sorry to hear that you lost your job and now must navigate the challenges of Unemployment Insurance. You may encounter busy phone lines, an inability to speak to a live person, and state unemployment website issues. This will depend on what state you live in and when you filed. Presently over 42 million are out of work and seeking unemployment, which exacerbates these problems.  Pandemic Unemployment Insurance (PUI) will likely replace most or all your earnings temporarily. However, it might take a month or more for funds to arrive. If you have become unemployed, I recommend that you immediately apply for Unemployment Insurance. Apply for the existing Regular Unemployment Insurance (UI) program, New Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, and the New Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program (an extra $600 per month under the CARES Act). Depending on your state, these program applications may be bundled together into a single application or separate. Either way, you apply for all of them via your state\u2019s UI Agency. Find your state\u2019s UI Agency at  this website .  It will likely take at least three weeks after your application is approved for your first payment to arrive. So apply in the first week that you are without work or have had your hours cut. Because of the many and significant changes to UI, you should forget what you thought you knew about the program.  Even if you have never qualified for UI before or think you are not going to qualify, go ahead and apply. ",
    "Will I receive a stimulus check?": " Note : This article is about the first stimulus payments as part of the CARES Act from March 2020.

This means if you do not get a check in 2020, you may be able to claim the tax credit next year. The IRS calls this check an \u201ceconomic impact payment.\u201d  The amount you get will be based on your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) from the last tax return you filed, either 2018 or 2019. AGI is your total income minus a handful of deductions such as pre-taxed retirement contributions, 1/2 self-employment tax, HSA deductions, etc.  Who qualifies for a stimulus check?  You might qualify for a check even if you did not earn enough to file a return. You must have a Social Security number for you, your spouse, and any qualifying children.

The government will base the check amount on the SSA-1099 or the RRB-1099.  How will I receive the stimulus check?  Payments will be electronically deposited if you provided direct deposit information to the IRS. If not, then the IRS will mail your check. The IRS plans to develop an  online portal  for people to provide banking information. For now, Intuit TurboTax is offering a free  Stimulus Registration portal  for non-tax filers to share their mailing address or direct deposit information.  As of March 31, 2020, the IRS plans to start distributing checks in April. The IRS suggests checking the  IRS Coronavirus website  for updates instead of calling the IRS.

    "Resources for Small Business Owners Impacted by COVID-19": " Many small businesses are experiencing economic hardship because of COVID-19. In light of social distancing recommendations and other stay-at-home rules, there has been a dramatic decrease in economic activity.   There are two main programs in the CARES Act that support small businesses. These programs are the Paycheck Protection Program or PPP 7(a) Loan Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) loan program. They provide economic relief to small businesses adversely impacted by the COVID-19.   Under the CARES Act, your PPP loan can be forgiven up to the full principal amount if you use the loan on approved expenses. SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) are available to small businesses that suffer economic injury in a declared disaster area. These loans have a low-interest rate up to $200,000 for 30 years. Under the EIDL program, small business owners can apply for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan advance of up to $10,000. This advance provides economic relief to businesses experiencing a temporary loss of revenue and will not have to be repaid.  Eligible business can apply for both programs. Refer to the  Small Business Administration website  for information on SBA loan programs. ",
    "Financial Tips for the Coronavirus Crisis": " Every 5-10 years, we face a major crisis. Today it\u2019s the Coronavirus, a decade ago it was the housing bubble burst, before that September 11, and before that the dot.com bust. My point is that a crisis will come and go, but the sound financial principles needed to weather the storms of a crisis never change.  How to handle a drop in income  Any time you face a possible drop in income, the best defense is a good offense:     Contact your creditors. Let them know you may have a drop in income and may not be able to pay your bill. Creditors are far more likely to work with you if you proactively call them before you miss a payment. Temporarily stop any excess payments to debts. Continue to pay the debt minimums and start saving to cover living and unexpected expenses. When the crisis passes, you have a chunk of cash to throw at your debts. Review your spending for expenses to reduce. For most people, groceries (doing more coupons, meal planning, etc.), eating out, entertainment and travel are the quickest expenses to cut.  Postpone major expenses or upgrades until you can gauge the long-term impact of the crisis to your finances.  How to respond to the changing stock market  If you are watching your 401k plan turn into a 201k plan, your first reaction may be to sell. I encourage you to think twice. The last 10 unusual years of market highs have made people forget that highs and lows in the stock market are normal. The last thing you want to do is make a short-term decision based on panic that will cost you long-term market gains.  Don\u2019t believe me. Ask anyone who took their money out of the stock market 10 years ago. The Dow is a widely followed method of measuring the stock market. About 10 years ago, the Dow averaged about 10,600 points in 2010 and the Dow more than doubled in the last ten years (Dow hit a market high of 29,551 points in Feb 2020). I don\u2019t know about all of you, but it would hurt to know because of a moment of panic I missed my investments doubling in the future.  Your investment decisions should be based on:  How long before you need the money? A rule of thumb is that funds needed in five years or less should not be invested in the stock market. How much highs and lows in the market are can you handle? Remember, you have to be okay with your investments, whether the market is up or down. How much time do you want to spend researching and reviewing your investments? The best investment method is often the simplest.  None of the questions above have to do with temporary market conditions. Emotions can make an irrational decision seem logical.  It is tough watching what seems like the world falling apart around you. We are resilient and we will persevere.   ",
    "Am I Eligible for the Second Stimulus Check?": " Just before 2020 ended and 2021 began, President Trump signed a second pandemic relief bill. This bill included a second round of stimulus checks, or Economic Impact Payments, that will be sent to Americans under certain income thresholds in the coming weeks. Some of these checks have already started filtering in via direct deposit. As people struggle to make ends meet, there are lots of questions surrounding who will receive the stimulus, how much they will receive, and when it will hit their bank accounts.  How Much Can I Receive from the Second Stimulus Payment?  Those who are eligible for this stimulus payment will receive $600 per individual. So, a married couple eligible for payments would receive $600 each or $1,200 total. Additionally, eligible families will receive an extra $600 per child age 16 and under.  Who is Eligible for the Second Stimulus Payment?  Eligibility to receive a second stimulus check will be based on your 2019 tax return. An individual who recorded an adjusted gross (AGI) income of $75,000 or less on their 2019 taxes will qualify for the full $600. If their AGI was greater than $75,000, the benefits they receive will start to be phased out at a rate of $5 for every $100 they earn above the threshold.  For those who file their taxes with Head of Household status, the AGI limit is $112,500. Anyone at or below this threshold should receive full benefits. Their benefits will be phased out above this threshold at a rate of $5 for every $100 they earn above it.  For a married couple, the AGI limit is twice that of an individual, or $150,000 or less. Anyone at or below this threshold will receive full benefits. For those with a higher AGI, benefits phase out at the same rate as individuals and those who file with Head of Household status.  If they meet the income requirements, mixed-status immigrant families will also be eligible for the second stimulus relief check. This is a change from the first stimulus relief check. This means that U.S. citizens and green card holders who meet the income threshold will be eligible for the $600 relief check and the $1,200 check from the first stimulus bill, even if they file a joint tax return with an undocumented spouse.  Who is Not Eligible for the Second Stimulus Payment?  It is important to note that child dependents who are 17 or older do not qualify. This is based on a family\u2019s 2019 tax filing. So, if a child turned 17 in the second half of 2020, after taxes were filed, they could still qualify.  Adult dependents who are claimed on someone else\u2019s tax return also will not qualify. This means college students who are claimed on their parent\u2019s tax returns and older adults who are claimed on someone else\u2019s taxes won\u2019t get the payments.  When Will I Receive the Second Stimulus Payment?  The IRS is already delivering stimulus funds. Some individuals have already received theirs via direct deposit. And more funds go out each day. If you have direct deposit information on file with the IRS, they will deposit funds directly into that account. If you don\u2019t have current direct deposit information on file with the IRS but who are eligible, a check or a debit card will be sent by mail. You can claim the Economic Impact Payments on your 2020 tax return in 2021 if you are eligible but don\u2019t receive them.  Final Thoughts and Additional Resources  The second round of payments comes at a time when many are struggling and will hopefully provide some relief. It is important to be sure that you understand the eligibility requirements and the process so you can get benefits for which you are eligible.   If you are waiting on your payment, you may want to track it. To track your payment, use the IRS website\u2019s  Get My Payment tool . Track your payment using only the IRS website. Do not give out personal information to sources you don\u2019t know and trust. For additional information regarding the second round of Economic Impact Payments, check out the IRS\u2019s  Frequently Asked Questions .  This situation is still evolving, so check with the IRS if you have additional questions or need more information. ",

If you\u2019ve lost your job or had a cut in your hours or salary, then using the money in your emergency fund is warranted. Whether you need to drain your account is another question.

Your budget should consist only of necessities such as housing, utilities, car payment, insurance, gas, medicine, and food. Cover your basic survival needs so you have the ability to look for employment.  Next, evaluate all of your income. Think of new ways to come up with extra cash.

    "Who qualifies for unemployment benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic?": " Unemployment insurance can provide a temporary but vital replacement of earnings during the COVID-19 crisis. Unemployment insurance (UI) is a joint federal-state program. It\u2019s administered by states and provides cash benefits to eligible unemployed workers. In response to COVID-19, qualifying for unemployment has become more flexible.  Even if you didn\u2019t qualify for UI in the past, you may qualify now.  Criteria to qualify for unemployment insurance  Normally, to qualify for UI, you must be unemployed due to a lack of available work and must meet minimum work and earning requirements. In light of COVID-19, federal guidelines have expanded UI to more workers. Your eligibility depends on your personal circumstances and your state\u2019s policies. In general, assistance now includes workers who:  Can\u2019t go to work because their employer temporarily closes due to COVID-19 Are diagnosed with or are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking diagnosis Are ordered to isolate or quarantine by a medical provider or public health official Can\u2019t work due to caregiving responsibilities directly related to the pandemic Have exhausted their regular unemployment insurance benefits Aren\u2019t ordinarily eligible for unemployment benefits, including self-employed workers, gig workers, part-time workers, and workers with low earnings or limited work experience, who have lost work or income because of COVID-19\u2019s health or economic consequences  UI is not available for those able to work remotely or receiving paid sick leave or other paid leave benefits for their customary work week.  What to expect when you apply  Weekly UI payments from early April through late July will have an extra $600. You may receive a prorated amount of this if you\u2019re still working part-time. Federal guidelines also allow states to extend UI payments for additional weeks.   Individual states administer UI benefits and set different guidelines for eligibility. To check on your eligibility and apply for UI benefits, visit your state\u2019s program online. Apply as soon as you can, and keep trying. Many states\u2019 systems are outdated and overwhelmed by applications. Once you submit your application, it may take three or more weeks to receive your first benefit check. ",
    "What to do if you lose your health insurance during COVID-19": " Things in our personal lives are changing at the speed of light right now. Each day there is new information. We are constantly learning how to navigate the changing landscape in which we find ourselves. For many, these changes can include a reduction or complete loss of income and benefits as job hours are reduced or eliminated.  One of the biggest benefits that you may lose is health insurance. Because nearly half of workers in the U.S. get their health insurance coverage through their employer, this can leave you wondering what to do. If your hours are cut or you lose your job entirely, it\u2019s important to maintain health insurance. There are several ways to do so.  Option 1: COBRA  If you have recently lost health insurance due to an employment change, one option is to apply for insurance through COBRA. Most employers in the U.S. with 20 or more employees offer COBRA to their employees and their families. The program allows you to extend your employer-sponsored health care for up to 18 months. And you have 60 days after losing coverage to apply for benefits under COBRA.  The one major drawback to COBRA is that it is usually expensive. Normally, with employer provided insurance coverage, the employer pays for a portion (on average around 80%) of the premium. On COBRA, however, you have to pay the entire premium yourself. You will also be responsible for the administrative fees that your employer paid on your behalf. Your employer should notify you of your eligibility for COBRA within 14 days of your job status changing. Then you can elect to have COBRA coverage before your 60-day window expires.  Option 2: Insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)  If maintaining your employer sponsored care through COBRA is cost-prohibitive, you should apply for health insurance on the health insurance exchange. Losing your health benefits is a qualifying event. It will allow you to apply for insurance on the exchange, even if the open enrollment period for the year is closed. Again, with this program, you have 60 days after losing your job to apply for benefits.   Many individuals and families with modified adjusted gross incomes less than 400% of the federal poverty level qualify for a federal subsidy to offset the cost of ACA insurance plans. This would mean $49,960 for a single person and $103,000 for a family of 4 in the continental US. California has added its own subsidies to reduce costs.  To apply for insurance under the ACA, make sure that you are going through the legitimate site. There are several that look similar, but sell non-compliant policies.  Start here  and it may then connect you to your state\u2019s health insurance exchange.  When you apply for health insurance through the exchange, you\u2019ll need to estimate your income for the calendar year. It can be difficult to do this when unemployed. Take into consideration all anticipated sources of income for yourself and your family members, including unemployment insurance, wages, and alimony.  Be sure to find a policy with benefits that are right for both your health and financial situation. Consider benefits, out-of-pocket costs, and your monthly deductible. Hopefully you can find a coverage option in your price range.  Option 3: Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)  If you expect your household income to be less than 138% of the federal poverty level, you may qualify for Medicaid. Medicaid offers free or low-cost health care. This would be $17,236 for a single person or $38,625 for a family of four. According to the federal government, low-income families, qualified pregnant women and children, and individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income may qualify.  Some states have expanded Medicaid to cover additional groups like:  individuals receiving home and community-based services children in foster care adults with income below a certain threshold  Free or low-cost health care coverage for pregnant women and children in households with slightly higher incomes may be available through your state\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  How to Get Started  The variety of health insurance options available can be confusing. However, the good news is that you should be able to complete a single application and find out what support is available to you through the  health insurance exchange .  If you\u2019re struggling with the application process or understanding your options, you can get an appointment with a  Navigator or Certified Application Counselor affiliated with a local non-profit .  In these uncertain times, it\u2019s so important to take care of your own health and the health of your family. Even with job loss and situation changes, there are options to get and maintain health insurance coverage. Take time to research your options and understand the conditions you need to meet. Then find the best-fit coverage for you and your family. You can rest easier knowing that you are covered! ",

    "An Update on Unemployment and Taxes: Your Questions Answered": " We know that many of you have burning questions about unemployment benefits, including how they affect taxes and how they relate to the  American Rescue Plan . Here are answers to some of the questions you\u2019ve asked.   What Does the American Rescue Plan Do for Me if I\u2019m Unemployed?   If you lost your job during the pandemic, the American Rescue Plan extends certain pandemic-related programs through September 6, 2021. Here are some of the ways that you could benefit.    Federal unemployment benefits (FPUC), at $300 per week, on top of state benefits. If you have exhausted state unemployment benefits, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) will be extended to 53 weeks. These are for the \u201clong-term unemployed\u201d who were initially eligible for state benefits but exhausted them before finding employment.  If you are typically ineligible for state unemployment benefits, the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program will be extended to 79 weeks (up to 86 weeks in some states). You may be eligible for PUA if you lost work for specific COVID-related reasons but are ineligible for normal state benefits. This includes self-employed people and gig workers. If you earned both self-employment income and other wages, you might be eligible for an additional $100 per week from the Mixed Earners Unemployment Compensation (MEUC) program.  For more details about all of these programs, check out this  guide  from The Century Foundation.   I Heard There\u2019s a $10,200 Tax Break for Unemployment Payments. What Does That Mean, and Should I File an Amended Return?  If you received unemployment income in 2020, the first $10,200  will not be taxable . After that amount, unemployment is considered taxable income. For married couples who file jointly, the first $20,400 of unemployment income received in 2020 is non-taxable.   Tip : Find out more about  who qualifies for this tax break .   Note that this only applies to federal taxes. States have their own rules around tax breaks. You\u2019ll need to ask a tax preparer for help or look into your state\u2019s rules around tax breaks and unemployment income.  If you\u2019ve already filed your taxes for 2020, you don\u2019t need to file an amended return just yet. Wait for more information from the IRS.  I Think I Already Paid Taxes on My Unemployment Payments. Did I?  It\u2019s entirely possible. States are required to offer you the option to withhold taxes from your check, just as an employer would. If you chose to do so, you should have had 10% withheld from each payment.   If you did not choose to have taxes withheld and would like to start, you can do so  at the IRS site . A tax preparer can also help you determine if you overpaid these taxes and how to claim a refund.   What Should I Do Now?   The most important thing to know is that you should file your taxes. The national tax deadline was recently extended to May 17, which gives you an extra month \u2014 and for  Texas and Oklahoma residents , the deadline is pushed back to June 15.  When you file your taxes, you\u2019ll need to fill out the section on unemployment benefits and use Form 1099-G. Whichever state agency paid your unemployment benefits should issue you a 1099-G form for any payments you received in 2020. On the form, Box 1 is for how much you received, and Box 4 is for how much tax was taken out of those payments if any.  Do I Have to Pay State Taxes on Unemployment?  It depends on which state you live in. In some states, unemployment benefits are tax-exempt. Check with your state tax agency or your tax preparer for more information.
