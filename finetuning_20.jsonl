{"prompt":"How many credit cards should I have?","completion":"“Hi Saundra! As someone who is getting her credit back in order, I want to be wise about applying for credit cards. I have two and working hard to keep them both under 30% utilization. I’m considering applying for one last card. How many credit cards is too many?”  Submitted by Laurin O.  There are many opinions out there about credit. Some say that you shouldn’t use credit cards at all, while others say that credit cards can be a helpful financial tool when used wisely. I tend to be in the latter group. I want people to be confident using all financial instruments (banking, matched savings, debt, etc.) and I want them to know how to choose what is best for their financial goals.  Think about what having that third card would accomplish for you. What is the benefit of adding a third card? You mention “working hard” to maintain a 30% utilization rate. Does that mean you are using the cards to meet your expenses? If so, how might access to more credit change your financial choices?  Only you know the answer to “too many” cards, so focus on the point of the cards. Credit utilization (both collective and on individual accounts), the number of cards you have, and your credit history all impact your credit score. Adding a credit account can adversely impact two components (average length and number of accounts), not to mention the potential for over-extending yourself.  If you aren’t sure that what you are doing is working for you try using a free  credit scoring simulation  to see how adding that third card that might impact your goal. Keep in mind it isn’t a FICO score, but these tools can be great for helping you consider your choices. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Plan for the Cost of College with Your Kids","completion":" As a financial coach, I encourage parents to talk to their children about college as early as possible. Nowadays, college is one of the most expensive costs, next to a car or a home. Enrolling, paying, and attending college is also a complicated process.  Leaving this in the hands of an 18-year-old is unfair. Your child has no idea the true cost of anything, let alone college. They have no idea the mental and financial havoc a huge student loan debt will do to their futures. As parents, I urge you to step in and have enough courage to be willing to say no to an expensive school, so your kids can say yes to a future without huge student debt.  How to Start the Conversation  Let your kids know:  You want to be part of the decision. You’ll work with them so they don’t make a decision they will regret. You love them enough to say no to a college that will saddle them with debt they’ll be paying off when your future grandchild goes to college.  Important Questions to Discuss with Your Kids  Discuss whether they even want to go to college. If they’re hesitant, consider a local community college or trade school.  Be honest with your kids about how much you can financially support them. There is no shame in saying you cannot pay for college. The earlier they know, the longer you and your child have to research scholarships, grants, and other options to pay for college.  Encourage your kids to get jobs that pay for colleges like the military, Peace Corps, or even companies like Starbucks. Show your kids the  cost of their education choices . If they want to go to an expensive private school, show them how much debt they will have along with their  average starting salary . It doesn’t take a lot of math to figure out a $150,000 loan for a degree with an average career salary of $40,000 may not make sense. As their parent, you have to step in to protect their future. Use an  Expected Family Contribution Calculator  to estimate how much you may have to pay for college.   Research Other Resources for Paying for College  Next, talk with your kid’s school counselor about ways to pay for their college expenses.  Ask the counselor about tutoring programs to boost their college entrance exam scores. A high SAT or ACT score can equal scholarships, free tuition, or reduced tuition.  Find out how early your can start taking college entrance exams. Encourage your child to focus on their talents, whether athletic or academic. Work with your school counselor to research and apply for scholarships.   Talk to your child and their school counselor about your child either attending a local college and living at home or attending a local college for the first two years and then transferring to a 4-year college.  The kindest thing you can do for your child is to be honest about how much you can afford to help them pay for college. They will survive not going to their first college choice. They will survive living at home while they go to college. But they may struggle for 20 years to pay off $100,000 in student loan debt. Taking the time to engage with your kids about college will help protect their financial futures. "} 
{"prompt":"What’s holding me back from getting approved for a credit card?","completion":"What’s holding me back from getting approved for a credit card?  Submitted by anonymous.  There are  many reasons  that credit card companies deny an application for a credit card. They review your application and your credit history to assess if you have stable income and how likely you are to pay them back (on time). You may be denied if your credit reports show limited or negative history, or if you have too many open accounts.  If you have been denied, you have the right to review the report they used to make their decision. This is a great time to review your credit report so you know exactly what potential creditors see. Keep in mind that each time you submit a credit application, you get an “inquiry” on your report. Inquiries can actually can make your credit score go down. Be thoughtful about submitting applications and create a plan to establish or build your credit. "} 
{"prompt":"How do you use your tax refund?","completion":"Every month, part of your paycheck is sent straight to the government to pay your taxes. But at the end of the year, most people owe less than they’ve already paid – so they get money back from the government. These tax refunds are a huge influx of money for many American families.  If you’re struggling to save every month, your tax refund can be a great way to get started. After all, without knowing it, you’ve been putting away money every month that you can’t touch! Even if you already have a plan for your tax refund, putting some of it into savings can go a long way.  How Savers Used Their Refunds  SaverLife Savers received an average of $3,464 in refunds in 2018. Here’s how they said they used that money:   As you may have noticed, these numbers add up to more than 100%. Savers often told us they used their refunds for multiple goals.  One Saver named Rocio told us, “My tax refund is a blessing because I can tell my son that I am able to pay his school classes and education.” Another Saver named Cortney said, “I wanted to save my tax refund, but I had to have some car repairs done, so most of my tax refund went toward that.” "} 
{"prompt":"Should I save for my child in a custodial account or a 529 account?","completion":"Should I save for my child in a custodial account so he can use that money for whatever he chooses or should I save in a 529 account?  Submitted by anonymous.  Think about the goal YOU have for your child. What is the point of the savings?  A 529 is a good choice for children’s savings, but there are limitations. If you want your child to have more flexibility, there are other options. A Roth IRA, for example, allows you to withdraw your original contributions without penalty. The thing I like about this option is that you can use it for your children or for your own retirement if your little darling ends up getting oodles of scholarship cash and doesn’t need your money.  If you’re going to stick with an account for your child, keep in mind that a 529 is treated as a parent’s asset for the purpose of financial aid, whereas a custodial account is treated as the student’s asset. This can result in a higher Expected Family Contribution (EFC).  If you want to learn more about options for saving for your child, you can do some additional reading about  custodial accounts  and  using IRAs for educational expenses . "} 
{"prompt":"3 Reasons to Set Up an Automatic Savings Plan","completion":"There are endless strategies for saving money, but one that comes up again and again is setting up an automatic transfer. Lots of research, including our research here at SaverLife, shows that this is a good way to save more. In fact, SaverLife members who set up automatic savings transfers are 5-6% more likely to save at least $20/month.  Are you on the fence about setting up an automatic savings transfer? Here are some reasons we think you should give it a try:  1. Save without thinking about it  We all lead hectic lives. It’s hard to manage many competing priorities – so why not take one thing off your to-do list? By automating your savings, it happens without any effort. Many Savers tell us they set up a small automatic transfer and actually forgot about. Then, months later, they were shocked to see how much money they’d build up so easily.  2. Make saving a habit  At SaverLife, we like to say that saving is a behavior, not a balance. Even if you’re not able to save as much as you’d like, putting money away every month helps establish a habit of saving.  3. Have a separate savings account to manage your money  Everyone wants to save more, but if you keep money in a single account, it can be hard to compartmentalize which money you’re saving. By separating out a little bit of money every week or month, you’ll be able to visually see how much money you have for spending.  But be careful!  Many people are concerned about setting up an automatic transfer because they worry they will incur overdraft fees. This is an important concern. One option is to turn off overdraft protection, so that if you try to withdraw more than you have in your checking account, the transaction is denied instead of hitting you with an overdraft fee.  But for some people, automatic savings transfers may just not be the right way to save – and that’s great too! We want you to find a system that works for you. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Rebound from a Credit Slip","completion":"Credit slips can happen to anyone – and although you may panic when you see that number go in the wrong direction, sometimes even the best financial decisions may bring about a credit slip.  So dust yourself off and congratulate yourself on being proactive in checking your credit score and taking actions to help it bounce back. In a country where  half of adults haven’t checked their credit score in the last six months , you’re already ahead of the curve.  Your 90-Day Credit Sprint  The first thing I want you to do is check your budget to prepare for a 90-day credit-building sprint. During this sprint, you’ll focus on paying all your bills on time and  reducing your utilization rates , two crucial factors that determine your credit score.   Create a plan with checkpoints at 90 days, 6 months, and one year.  Work the plan by using free services like Credit Karma or Credit Sesame.  Check your progress regularly. If you have a credit card that offers a free credit score, you can use that. Make sure you’re not paying for scores.  Celebrate! Don’t miss out on an opportunity to recognize your progress when you reach your checkpoints or other big milestones.   Long-Term Credit Building  Create an ongoing plan for yourself to make sure that your credit score reflects your hard work and makes you a good candidate for new credit should you need it.  As part of this plan, it’s important that you conduct an  annual review  of your credit report to make sure it is accurate because this information will determine your credit score.

{"prompt":"Can I trade in my new truck for a cheaper car?","completion":" I have a truck that I just bought for $35,000. It’s now worth about $31,000. Can I trade my truck in for a $20,000 car? What happens with my negative equity on the truck and my sedan that I just paid for with the trade – in value?  Submitted by Jae E.  It’s common to buy a car and want to trade it in the next year for another new or used vehicle. In my own life, upside down car loans have probably cost me thousands of dollars. If you owe more on something than it’s worth, in the terminology of the industry, that is known as being upside-down. This applies to roughly half of all new-car buyers, according to Cars.com.  Let’s crunch the numbers  You bought a truck for $35,000, but now it is worth $31,000. That’s a $4,000 reduction in value. If you financed $35,000 on your vehicle for 60 months with a 4.27% interest rate, your payments are about $648.85/month. Your loan balance after 12 months would be approximately $28,583.69. If your truck has depreciated 25% or about $8750* in year one, the trade value would be about $26,250** even though the book value is $31,000. Unless you sell to an independent buyer, you hardly ever get book value when you trade a car with the dealer.   Based on this scenario, you would be upside-down on your loan about $2,334*** after one year. In this case, your new car purchase price is $20,000, but you owe $28,584. It’s only worth $26,250, so you would be paying $20,000 plus the balance of $2,334 or be paying and financing $22,334 under this scenario.  Avoiding Upside-Down Car Loans  To prevent being upside-down car loans again, try to avoid buying new cars unless you have the funds to put at least 20% down. Unfortunately, many people don’t understand the complicated financial and behavioral consequences of buying, selling, and trading vehicles. Once you’ve cleared up your problems with your upside-down car loan, do what you can to keep yourself from ending up in the same situation again.   *Car Loan Amortization Schedule Year 1 Payment: $7,786.20 Principal: $6,416.31 Interest: $1,369.89 Balance: $28,583.69 **Purchase Price ($35,00025%) Depreciation $8750=$26,250 ***Loan Balance after one year = $28,583.69 – Trade Value $26,250 You owe $2,334 more on the car than it’s worth.

{"prompt":"What loan options do I have for helping my child afford college?","completion":" Starting college is an exciting time for parents and students alike. But this excitement often comes with stress and uncertainty about how to pay for school. You may be wondering what options are available for you and your child.  If you want to help your child cover the costs of higher education, you have many different options. It’s important to understand your options in order to make an informed decision. There are both federal loan options and private loan options. Understanding these two loan options and how to compare them can help you make good decisions.  Should I get a Parent PLUS Loan?  The federal option available to parents is a Direct PLUS Loan, also called a Parent PLUS Loan. This loan has a fixed interest rate. Just like federal student loans, the servicer for this loan is assigned by the Department of Education. For this loan, the student must be enrolled in school at least half time.    To apply for a Parent PLUS Loan, you complete a separate application in addition to FAFSA each year. This application considers your credit and also ensures that you and your child meet the eligibility requirements for federal student aid. These requirements include US citizenship or eligible non-citizenship, financial need. Also the student must be enrolled in an eligible degree or certificate program at the institution they attend. If you qualify, you can borrow enough money to cover the difference between your child’s financial aid and the cost of attendance.    One benefit to the Parent PLUS Loan is that you can defer payments while your child is in school. If you don’t elect to do this, your payments will begin once the loan has been fully disbursed to the school. There are three repayment options for the Parent PLUS Loan: standard repayment, graduated repayment, and extended repayment. This loan can also be eligible for  Public Service Loan Forgiveness  if you consolidate them into a direct consolidation loan. Eligibility for this program and the different repayment options are based on the parent’s occupation.  Parent Plus Loans are in the parent’s name. You cannot transfer these loans to the student at any point in time.  Should I get a private loan to help my child pay for college?  In addition to the Parent PLUS Loan, you can also take out private education loans to help your child pay for school. These loans are different than private student loans that you cosign. Instead, these loans are designed for parents and are held solely in their name. Like the Parent PLUS Loan, private education loans for parents consider your creditworthiness. These private loans can have fixed or variable interest rates depending on the borrowing terms. Your credit will determine the interest rate.  Like the Parent PLUS Loan, you can privately borrow the difference between financial assistance and the cost of attendance.  Depending on the lender, you can select full deferment or interest only payments while your child is in school. Once your child graduates or leaves school, there are often different repayment plans that you can choose.  What is the right way for you to support your child?  Both types of parent loans allow you to help pay your child’s education expenses. Make sure that you can make the payments and understand the terms of the loans, as you are the ones borrowing the money. It’s also important that you are getting the best loan for your situation. Compare interest rates, repayment options, and fees to make an informed decision. "} 
{"prompt":"A Side Hustle Can Fix Your Budget","completion":" There are lots of articles written about cutting expenses in order to make your budget work. But there is an alternative. You can make more money to achieve the same desired result! Getting a side hustle, and bringing in more money each month, will correct the deficit of your budget just as quickly as spending less. You can also do a combination of both.  Side Hustle Ideas  A side hustle no longer has to be the traditional part-time job in addition to your full-time job. This approach will work of course, but let’s consider some alternatives. The key is to find a need and fill it. A few ideas include:  Would you want to try dog sitting or dog walking? House cleaning a few times a month for a friend can net a couple hundred dollars.    What about selling items on the internet? There are several marketplaces where people sell all kinds of things. Driving for a car service allows you to choose your hours.  If you don’t want people in your car, you can always deliver food. If you are a good candidate, you can donate plasma. Plasma centers will pay you for your time, and many offer free babysitting on-site for the time that you are in there. This is only a few hours a week. You can change your tax withholding. If you get a large tax return each year, consider visiting your HR department and asking them to help you adjust the amount of tax you are paying each month. There is no need to “lend” your money to the government (at zero interest) all year, just to get it back in March or April of the next year. You need the money every month, so it should be available to you.  Think outside the box!  Ask your friends and colleagues if they have any ideas for you. They might see a talent in you that you haven’t considered.  A simple side hustle might be all it takes to get you back on track. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Negotiate a Raise","completion":"I always like to say that there are only three things you can do to change your financial situation: make more, spend less, or a combination of the two. But making more money can be easier said than done. It could mean finding a new job, gaining additional skills, or working more hours. Let’s dive into one way you can make more money: negotiate a raise.  Know Your Why  If you’ve been in SaverLife for a while, you’re familiar with my constant refrain of “know your why!” It’s important to go back to your fundamental goals and the roots of your financial desires. If you’ve been thinking about asking for a raise, is it because you don’t feel that your work is being sufficiently valued? Is it really about money, or is there something else going on at work that makes you feel undervalued?  What will this additional money do for your financial life and allow you to accomplish? Get specific! You can consult a  pay raise calculator  to see how a raise will change your monthly and annual pay. And don’t forget that earning more money may put you in a different  tax bracket .  Know Your Worth  When you talk to your supervisor, you’ll need to present a reason you think you deserve more money – not just the reason you need the extra money. Have you been taking on additional responsibility, working longer hours, training other employees? Your pay should reflect your value to the company, so if you have more experience or responsibilities than you did when you were hired, it might be appropriate to ask for more money.  To start brainstorming about how you can frame this conversation, try doing a  SWOT analysis , which helps you identify strengths that you can highlight. Make a few notes on the accomplishments you’re proud of, successes you’ve had at work, and the impact you’ve had on your team or company.  Here are some important questions to have answers for:   What is the business case for increasing your compensation? In other words, how is keeping you happy beneficial to their business bottom line?  What is the standard pay raise in your industry? Many industries have a standard of 3% annual raises.  How does your pay rate compare to other companies in your industry?   Know Your When  Timing matters. If your employer is stressed or trying to finish a project, it’s not the best time to negotiate a raise. The ideal time would be after a big company success where you played a part in the positive outcome. And of course, a performance review is usually a neutral time to have this conversation. Your employer may even be expecting you to ask.  Know Your Bottom Line  Your employer may say no. What next? Have a plan for how you want to proceed. If you intend to stay even without the raise, ask what you need to do differently to get a raise in the future. What expectations are not being met? If you intend to leave if you don’t receive the raise, be mindful that you may need a reference from your current employer.  ***  If you’re on the fence about asking for a raise, remember that you have more leverage than you might think. A  survey from PayScale  found that only 37% of workers have negotiated to increase their pay, but of those who asked for a raise, 70% received one. "}

{"prompt":"Investing 101: Stocks, Bonds, and More","completion":"One of the most common questions I get asked is about investing. How should I start investing? What investment options do you recommend? What is a low-risk investing option? Don’t worry, we’re going to get there. But first, let’s start with something more basic.  Investing is a means to an end, not an end itself  Understanding how stocks and bonds work is pretty cut and dry, but the context matters – and in this case, the context is your financial situation and goals. I want you to start by going back to your “why.” What concrete financial goals do you have for your future?  Your goal could be buying a home, paying for your children or grandchildren to go to college, retiring at a certain age, or saving up to start your own business. Once you know this goal, you can figure out how much money you will need to accomplish it and when you will need this money.  Do you have your “why” ready? Let’s dive in!  What are stocks?  When you buy a stock, you are investing in a company. If the company grows and the stock becomes more valuable, your investment will grow with it. However, if the company fails or becomes less valuable (which happens to companies every day), your stock could be worth less or even nothing.  What are bonds?  When you buy a bond, you are loaning money to a company. The company will then repay your loan with interest at a specific time. The company may also pay you dividends (a percentage of the company’s earnings). Bonds are generally considered “safer” investments than stocks – less likely to lose all their value, but also less likely to increase hugely in value.  What is your risk tolerance?  The stock market as a whole goes up and down regularly. Sometimes it seems to go up, up, and up, and sometimes it plunges down. From 2000 to 2002, for example, the U.S. stock market lost about half of its value. Most investors agree that a big drop is inevitable at some point. So how willing are you to take on that risk? You have to think about the upside AND the downside when choosing to invest.  Creating your portfolio  So there are different types of investments, and those investments carry different levels of risks.   This image is modified from Smart About Money’s  “Determining Your Risk Tolerance” lesson .  Depending on your risk tolerance, you can fill your portfolio with an allocation of risky and safe assets that matches your preferences. Your portfolio should be part of your overall financial plan so take into consideration the status of your savings and ability to weather changes in the economy.  Remember that the “safer” investments carry a different kind of risk, which investors call  inflation risk . This is the risk that, over time, your money will have less buying power due to inflation. In the short run, you don’t have to worry much about inflation; but over decades, inflation will significantly impact the buying power of your money if you keep that money in safe investment vehicles like cash.  Investing is just one piece of the puzzle  I hope you see that investing is not an end in itself. Whether you keep your money in cash or in the stock market, you are taking on certain risks. Remember to view investing as just one piece of your financial life and align it with your short- and long-term goals. While looking into investing, make sure you’re taking care of yourself by maintaining an emergency fund and protecting your important assets.  My perspective on investing is inspired by a great resource called  Transparent Investing . I hope you check out the full guide if you’re interested in learning more.

{"prompt":"Making Your Money Work for You","completion":" Hi, I’m Saundra Davis, financial coach here at SaverLife. Today we’re going to talk about how you make your money work for you.  What is a budget?  If you ask, “Do you have a budget?” many folks will say no, they don’t have a budget. The fact is we all have a budget, whether we know it or not. Money comes in and money goes out and how our cash flows by default becomes our budget.  Is your budget working for you?  The question is: Are you happy with the choices that you make and are your choices getting you what you want? If the way you’re spending your money is not getting you what you want, you might be happier if you make some choices about where you want your money to go before you actually spend it. There are some easy rules of thumb that you can try to see if one of them work for you.  The 80/20 rule  Let’s start with the  80/20 rule . Many people try to live within 80% of your income, making sure that 80% of all your income goes to your living and your lifestyle expenses. So we’re talking about your rent or your mortgage, your food, your transportation, leaving 20% to put in to savings. If you live in an area where it’s just not reasonable to live within 80% of your income, you might have to do a 90/10 percent split: 90% for your living expenses, 10% for savings.  The key is make sure savings factors in to all of your decisions, even if it’s only a little bit and that you put your savings aside first before you pay all of your bills.  Re-evaluate your new strategy  Now the question is: How will you know if this is working? Try on a new approach for a short period of time – one, two, or three months – to determine if you’re happier with the choices that you’re making. Remember you’re the boss. Your money, your decisions. You can decide how you save and how you spend.  What are you saving for? "} 
{"prompt":"5 Reasons Why You Can’t Stick to Your Budget and How to Fix It","completion":" For years, I struggled to budget. I was frustrated that I was following all the budgeting rules but still coming up short. After carefully looking at my spending over a few months, I realized I was making several budgeting mistakes.  Once I corrected the errors, I was able to stick to a budget that helped my family become debt-free, save money, and buy a house. Below are some reasons people struggle to stick to a budget and how to overcome them:  1. Budgeting Only for Monthly Bills  Ideally, a budget is a written plan for how you are going to spend all your money on a monthly basis. I find the categories most people fail to include are school activities, restaurants, groceries, gas, entertainment, personal care, and gifts.  These are typically expenses without billed statements that go up and down each month. Either use your online bank budgeting tools or a  budgeting app  to track your spending to make sure your budget truly reflects all your monthly spending.  2. Having Unrealistic Expectations  It takes about three months to adjust to budgeting. Give yourself the grace to make mistakes and learn from them. Be realistic; it’s tough to go from eating out every night to making homemade organic meals. It’s okay to have a few frozen meals and limit eating out to your busiest days. Also, look for opportunities to make the most of your spending by dining at restaurants where  kids can eat free .  3. Overspending in One Area  If you spend most of your paycheck on a car or home, you will struggle to cover unexpected expenses (see #4). One rule of thumb is to spend no more than 25-35% of your take-home pay on a mortgage or rent. Another for cars is the  20/4/10 rule : Make a down payment of at least 20%, finance your vehicle for no more than four years, and spend 10% or less of your gross monthly pay on total monthly car expenses (car payment + insurance).  4. No Savings  Savings should cover at least two types of needs: known and unknown expenses. Upcoming known expenses include scheduled car and home maintenance, car registration and gifts. The other need is to cover those unfortunate surprises—unusually high costs like transmissions repairs, medical expenses or a busted pipe in your home. Try to save at least three months of expenses in an account at a different bank than the one you use for daily spending.  5. Not Updating Your Budget Monthly  Your budget should change as your spending needs change. Examples include higher daycare expenses during school breaks, a higher electric bill in the summer, or a higher gas bill in the winter. Overlooking these fluctuations can have you scrambling to cover expenses.  Don’t lose hope! With a few tweaks, you can find success with budgeting. "}

{"prompt":"3 Steps for Recovering from a Financial Setback","completion":"What happens when you have a financial setback? You may feel defeated and even hopeless when your efforts to save take a hit.  Saving helps prevent financial emergencies  Consider this: many of the financial hiccups we face are NOT actual emergencies. For example, we know that if we own a car we are likely to need repairs. Of course, they become emergencies because they usually happen when we are least prepared.  Preparation is the whole point of starting a saving habit. You may have to dip into your savings to pay for car repairs or other unexpected hits to your wallet – and that is exactly the reason to create a habit of saving.  1. Resources for handling emergencies  If (well, I guess we should say “when”) you have a financial setback, do what you need to do to address the situation. Look at all of the options available to you, including your savings. Your long term financial health is sure to be better if you choose the lowest cost options (money you’ve saved, borrowing from family/friends) or  small dollar loans  from a credit union (try to avoid payday lenders).  2. Revisit your savings goals  Be sure that you have a plan to repay yourself – just like you would if you borrowed from someone else. Once you have dealt with the emergency, get back on track. If you can add a little extra each month, you will rebuild your savings account in no time.  This is also a great time to look at your financial priorities and goals and create a savings target for unplanned expenses. A good starting point is the total amount of ALL of your insurance deductibles (health, auto, renter’s/homeowner’s). That way, you always know your financial protection plan is secure.  3. Don’t dwell in shame  Keep in mind, financial emergencies are often normal situations that we simply weren’t prepared for. Abusing ourselves with shame or blame is never helpful.  Learn the lesson, leave the shame.  What do you want to do to be better prepared next time (and we know there is always a next time)? "} 
{"prompt":"How to Manage What Gets Charged to a Credit Card","completion":" Credit can be a valuable tool in your personal finance arsenal. It allows you to buy things you need and earn points or cash back. It also offers a way to conduct secure transactions online and provides some protections against theft and fraud. But, if not managed properly, it can be a road to high-interest debt that can be difficult to pay off. So, what is the secret to successfully managing what you charge to your credit card?  What Should I Charge to My Credit Card?  The best place to start when deciding what charges to put on your credit card is your budget. If you have already budgeted for an expense and know that you can pay for it, you can put it on your credit card. This will allow you to take advantage of credit card rewards while giving you peace of mind, knowing you can pay your credit card bill in full each month.   Examples of expenses that make sense to put on a credit card include:  groceries gas your monthly Netflix or Apple Music subscription your child’s monthly sports or music lessons  These are all items that should already be included in your budget each month. So, instead of using your cash to pay the bill directly, you have the option to use your credit card. You can charge the expense. Then, pay the credit card bill using the money you budgeted for the expense.  What Should I NOT Charge to My Credit Card?  While it can be tempting to put all your monthly bills and expenses on your credit card, it is not necessarily a good idea. If you put expenses you haven’t budgeted for on your credit card, you may not have the means to pay them when the bill comes.  Impulse purchases or purchases for friends or family who don’t have the money to make the purchase on their own should not be charged to your credit card. In both of these cases you don’t have money set aside to pay for the item. So, when the credit card bill comes you will have to find the money to pay for it elsewhere. This can mean taking money budgeted for something else to pay the bill or only making the minimum payment. Neither option puts you in an optimal financial situation.  It can also be tempting to put larger bills like your annual tax payment or a large legal bill on a credit card. If you put your tax payment on your credit card, you will face a service fee that can be nearly 2%. This makes your bill even higher than it already was. And legal bills can be large due to high hourly rates. This can result in high interest charges if you can’t pay the credit card bill in full when it comes due.  Should I Use My Credit Card for Emergencies?  Things in life happen that we can’t always plan for. And these emergencies often come with expenses. If you have to put more of your credit card than you can pay off in a month due to an emergency, that is okay. Be sure to pay as much as you can each month to minimize interest charges. And pay the bill off in full as soon as you can.  Best Practices for Credit Card Management  Only charge expenses to your credit card that you know you can pay in full when the bill comes. This will help save you money on interest. It will also help you build a good credit score. Your payment history accounts for 35% of your credit score. If you know you can pay your bill on time each month, this will help build up your score.    When calculating your score, credit scoring agencies consider your available credit to account for 30% of your score. They want to see a utilization ratio of 30% or less (lower is better). This means that you aren’t carrying a balance of more than 30% of your available credit (across all open credit accounts). Paying your bill off each month will keep your credit usage low and leave you with a larger amount of available credit.  Allowing your budget to dictate your credit spending will help you keep your usage in check. It will also allow you to use credit as a tool to help you out financially instead of allowing it to become a burden that weighs you down. "} 
{"prompt":"How much of my income should I save?","completion":" Financial experts recommend that you save at least ten percent of your take-home income (after taxes have been deducted). But what’s more important than the amount you save is getting into a habit of saving based on your personal goals and what’s realistic for you. To determine what makes sense for you:  List and prioritize your life or financial goals  How do you want your life to be different six months from now? In a year? In five years? For your top goal, put a date and dollar amount on it. How much would need to set aside each month to reach that goal? Is that amount possible for you? If not, what could you change?  Prepare a realistic spending plan  Gather up all of your records related to income and expenses for one month. Then subtract your expenses from your income. How much is left over? Does that feel right? Could you make changes to your earning and spending habits to set more money aside?  Consider your overall financial picture  If you have a significant amount of debt, are having trouble making ends meet, or are in the middle of a financial crisis, taking care of those situations should take precedence over saving for future goals. Once your financial situation has stabilized, think about starting to save for an emergency fund to provide a safety net if your car breaks down or you lose your job.  Start small  If you are not in the habit of saving or money is tight, commit to a small amount that you will be able to set aside on a monthly basis to start growing your savings over time.  Find a savings product that works for you  There are a variety of savings products out there that offer different rates and features. Of course, getting the best rate possible is important. And there may be other features that are important to you. Do you want your savings account attached to your checking account for easy transfers? Do you want restricted withdrawals to prevent temptation?  Save irregular and extra income  As your income grows or you have unexpected windfalls (bonuses, tax returns,  stimulus checks ), plan to set most, if not all, of that money aside to boost your savings.  ***  Keep in mind that finances are personal!  Experts may recommend ideals, but it’s up to you to determine your own sound and realistic financial practices. Follow these tips to build your savings habit today. "} 
{"prompt":"Game Plan for Starting a Small Business","completion":" When I first became a financial planner, my specialty was small business owners. I also headed my local Chamber of Commerce’s Small Business committee. Over the years, I received a lot of excellent business advice. Below are the top five most impactful business tips I’ve heard:  Get your personal financial house in order  If you plan to leave your job, create a budget based on your new income. Live on your new budget for three to six months before quitting to gauge if you can live on the new budget. Have at least six months of income saved for household emergencies. In my first six months of business, I had over $5,000 in unexpected expenses. My emergency savings account was a life-saver. Pay off your debts, particularly your credit card debts.  Get buy-in from your family  Starting a business is going to be a sacrifice for everyone in your family. Starting a business is an emotional, relational, time, and financial strain on your family. If any of these areas are already suffering, business ownership at this time may make it worse. Discuss with your family your new work hours and any changes that may impact your family.   Take the time to research  As a former head of a Small Business Committee, I saw so many businesses come and go because they did not study their business idea. Just because you think it’s a great idea does not mean people will pay you what you think your idea is worth it.  SCORE  is a free mentorship program for business owners. A mentor can save you thousands of dollars in mistakes by helping you navigate business decisions.  Create a business plan  I saw many businesses fail because they did not have a business plan. A business plan can help you do the following:  Assess how much money you would need to start your business (it’s always higher than you think) Help you estimate how long before your business breaks even (it’s typically longer than you think) Decide if your business location is ideal Market your business to get clients Luckily you can tap into a lot free or low-cost help to starting and maintaining your business such as  SCORE ,  SBA ,  Small Business Development Centers , and your local  chamber of commerce  or business association.  Start Small  Consider using what some call an upside-down business strategy. The model takes advantage of the low cost and ease of creating an online presence through social media and a website to build an audience of your future customers. The low cost allows you to refine your message and understand what your audience wants. Once you create an audience of people who know, like, and trust you, you can confidently develop products and services because you know from your audience what they want. This model is less costly and risky than the traditional way of starting a business, which is to start with the product, then try to create a message.  No matter what method you use, the important thing is to start from where you are and just get started. "}
