{"prompt":"Teaching Your Kids to Save Money","completion":"Think about the lessons you learned about money. How do the messages you heard in your early years impact the way you view and manage money today? Research shows that lifelong money habits are formed early. In fact, psychologists believe that  by age 7  (I know, right?), kids have already developed long-lasting attitudes about money.  So how do you talk to your kids about money in a way that sets them up for financial success?  What Shaped Your Financial Attitudes?  Start by reflecting on how your childhood shaped your current financial behaviors and attitudes. How did you learn these lessons?  Many folks in our SaverLife community tell us that they remember their parents’ frugality – or their parents’ spending – and realize that they are unconsciously copying those behaviors, or consciously trying to act differently.  Model the Behaviors You Want Kids to Practice  Kids see and notice a lot, so unfortunately, the “do as I say, not as I do” strategy often falls flat. I believe that it’s not just about teaching good financial behaviors. We have to live those values we want to instill in our young people.  Here are a few questions I want you to consider:   What do your kids observe you doing or saying about money?  Are you stressed about money?  What words or phrases do you repeat often about money?  How do you think your kids interpret your messages?   Start Saving with Your Kids  If you’re able to, I think giving your kids an allowance is a good way to practice managing money. Talk to them about their goals for their money and encourage them to save up for things that matter to them – perhaps a new bike or a charitable cause they care about.  If they meet their goals, celebrate with them! You could even consider setting up a small match to reward them for saving instead of immediately spending their money. (Sound familiar? If you haven’t already,  sign up for SaverLife  so you can start earning rewards and prizes for saving.)  Involve Your Kids in Real-World Decisions  Everyday lessons are the easiest way to share your values. The next time you are shopping for groceries, think about the choices you make and describe your reasons to your children. I find that when I tell my grandchildren why I make the choices I do, they are clear about my values and how I behave with money, even when I make financial mistakes. For example, I explain to my grandchildren that I don’t buy gifts because I believe in buying experiences instead.  So, if you’re buying a car, moving to a new house, getting a pet, or paying with a credit card, involve your kids. Share your thought process to help them understand the complexities of financial decision-making.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has a great resource called  Money as You Grow  that dives deeper into important age-appropriate money conversations to have with your kids. "}

I am trying to save to move out of my parents’ home quickly due to an eviction. Please help!  Submitted by an anonymous SaverLife member.  I’m proud of you for reaching out to get help with your financial situation. It sounds like you have a lot going on and your debt is a major factor in the situation. Depending on how your debt has impacted your credit history and score, it may be difficult to rent a home right now. Here are steps to help you get control of your debt so that living on your own can become a reality.  Meet with a Nonprofit Credit Counselor  A credit counselor can work with you to review your debt, assess payment options, and identify strategies to address your housing situation. Nonprofit credit counseling centers provide assistance with debt management, review of credit reports, bankruptcy counseling, and counseling for other financial issues. Go to the  National Foundation for Credit Counseling website  and enter your zip code to find a center near you. You don’t have to go it alone!  Review Your Credit Report  Your credit report is a record of your history of managing and repaying debt. The report will show all of your current and past credit accounts, amounts owed, payment history, and accounts that are delinquent.

Go to  AnnualCreditReport.com  to check your reports. You will need to provide your name, address, social security number, and date of birth to verify your identity. Checking your report will give you the information you need to assess your debt situation.  Reflect on Your Situation  Before making any changes, reflect on what happened to get you into this situation. What do you want to change? Be objective and make a list of the specific events that caused the debt. Whether it was a medical emergency, student loan debt or an unhealthy relationship, understanding where you have been will help you set goals. Once you have reflected on the situation, identify two to three goals you want to achieve or changes you want to make.  Right now, you may feel as though there is no way out of your debt. Learning more about how to manage and pay off your debt and how it impacts you will help get you on track. "} 
{"prompt":"What Is a Roth IRA?","completion":" A Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account) allows you to save up to a certain amount of money in a non-deductible, after-tax account. Contributions to the account are not tax-deductible, but funds grow tax-free. Any withdrawals made after age 59 ½ are tax-free. The annual contributions limit, set by the Federal government, is $6,000 for 2021 for individuals under the age of 50 and $7,000 for individuals over the age of 50.   Roth IRAs are designed for individuals who earn less than $140,000 (single) or $208,000 (married) to save for retirement. You can make contributions to the account at any age as long as you have earned income. There are no required minimum distributions as with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.  How to Open a Roth IRA  To open a Roth IRA, look for a financial institution that has received IRS approval to offer IRAs. Examples are banks, credit unions, brokerage companies, and savings and loan associations. You can establish a Roth IRA at any time. Compare fees, and specific account requirements when selecting a Roth IRA.  Can I Take Money Out of a Roth IRA?  Funds withdrawn from the Roth IRA need to be qualified distributions. If you withdraw an amount equal to the sum you deposited, the distribution is not taxable income, so it’s not subject to a penalty. If you withdraw funds before the age of 59 ½, to be considered a qualified distribution they need to be used for the purchase of a first home, distributed to the beneficiary of the Roth IRA, or the Roth IRA holder has become disabled.   The biggest advantages are no taxes on withdrawals and being able to continue contributions while earning income. "} 
{"prompt":"Ready to Start Investing? 6 Tips for Avoiding Scams","completion":"You’ve worked hard to get where you are financially, and investing might seem like the next step. But sometimes the financial landscape (and especially the internet) is like the Wild West. Let’s go through some tips to have in mind and common pitfalls to watch out for when you start investing.  Know Your “Why”  With any investment, start with your “why” – this includes specific financial goals you want to reach, the dollar amounts your goals will require, and the time horizon on which you hope to accomplish your goals.  If you’re looking to “get rich quick,” that is not a realistic or healthy goal for your investments. Likewise, if you’re seeking a “no-risk investment,” that is another red flag.  Guaranteed Rate of Return  Investing, by its very definition, involves some level of risk (although you can choose low-risk or high-risk investment options depending on your risk tolerance). If someone is offering you something with a guaranteed rate of return, that should set off all your “scam” alarm bells.  The exception is annuities; some annuities offer a guaranteed rate, but they are usually sold by a broker. Annuities are most often used to help people manage their income in retirement. If you think an annuity might be a good option for you, check out this  overview on annuities  from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Scrutinize the Bandwagon  When all of your friends and family are telling you about a “can’t lose” investment, don’t buy the hype. Feeling like everyone around you is getting in on an awesome investment opportunity can make it feel like you’re missing out, but this is actually a common sales pitch for scams.  Affinity fraud is when a scam targets members of a particular social circle, religious group, or ethnic background – so even if it seems like everyone around you is buying in to something,  do your research  and start with skepticism.  Ponzi Alert  A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment fraud where they money you’re investing does not actually go toward a real company or investment. Instead, the money you “invest” is used to pay returns to earlier investors. Ponzi schemes at some point fail to attract a steady stream of new investors, and at this point, everyone except the earliest investors will lose their money.  Did you know that Ponzi schemes are named for a real person?  Charles Ponzi  scammed investors in the 1920s with what he claimed was postage stamp speculation. Again, the SEC is a great resource to learn about  Ponzi scheme “red flags”  – these include being offered unusually high returns with very low risk.  Get an Account Statement  Your investment account statements are easy to skim and throw away, but it’s worth taking a closer look to make sure you’re clear about the details of your investments. Sometimes you  can  judge a book by its cover: if your account statement looks unprofessional or altered, this is a good tip that it may be fraudulent.  Make sure your account statement has all these  key pieces of information  and don’t be afraid to ask questions if you feel like something might be off.  Check the Source  If you’re ever suspicious or uncertain, trust your gut and do some research. Here are a few good places to start:   BrokerCheck from FINRA : Use this free online tool to research the background of financial brokers, advisers, and firms.  Certified Financial Planner : CFPs are professionals trained in financial planning who can serve as trustworthy resources in your financial life.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) : The CFPB is a U.S. government agency that works to make sure that banks, lenders, and other financial companies treat consumers fairly.   ***  All investments have some inherent risk (that’s the downside of putting money into the market). But if you stick to an investment strategy, create a diversified portfolio, and keep a keen eye out for scams, you can minimize your risk and maximize your reward. "} 
{"prompt":"How does Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) work?","completion":" Are you over the age of 60 looking for free help with your taxes? If so, consider taking advantage of an IRS program called The Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Program. This program partners with a variety of organizations, like AARP, to offer free tax assistance for those 60 and over (no income eligibility).  The IRS offers the TCE program during regular tax season, which typically runs from January 1 to April 15, although some participating organizations may continue the program for longer. The volunteers that help you with your taxes are trained by the IRS to answer questions about retirement-related issues unique to seniors. Many volunteers are retired professionals.   The AARP Tax-Aid program runs the majority of the TCE Sites, although various nonprofits and charities have TCE sites. Many sites have language specialists to help those whose primary language is not English.  What TCE Sites Can Help With  In general, TCE sites can prepare basic state and federal tax returns. Some sites not be able to help with the following income, expenses, or credits:   Schedule K-1 income (reported on forms 1065, 1120S, and 1041)  Sale of home (reported on Form 1099-S)  Cancellation of debt (reported on form 1099-C)  International returns  Typically, TCE sites cannot help with complicated returns, including:  Self-employment income with an overall loss to report, more than $25,000 in expenses, or deductions for depreciation or business use of the home Complex capital gains or losses, or when cost basis is not reported Oil and gas royalties  Rental income and expenses – some sites certified for military returns can do these for military personnel only Other forms for complex tax concerns  Finding a TCE Site Near You  Some TCE sites take appointments, while others operate on a walk-in basis only. To find a location near you, call 800-906-9887 or for the AARP Tax-Aide site, call 1-888-227-7669. You can also search for a TCE site using the  IRS Free Tax Prep website  or the  AARP Tax-Aide Site Locator .  Make sure you read the IRS’s recommendations for  what to bring  when you visit a TCE site.  Consider taking full advantage of programs like TCE and  VITA  for help completing your tax return! "} 
{"prompt":"How do you balance debt and savings? Here’s what our research found.","completion":"If you’re paying down debt, saving money may be a low priority for you. After all, you’re probably paying interest on your debt every month, so paying off your debt more quickly means keeping more money in your pocket long-term.  It’s harder to save when you have debt  Our research found that Savers with a very good or excellent credit score (the two highest categories) were more likely to save at least $20/month than Savers with lower credit scores. Savers who had no debt or a manageable amount of debt were also more likely to save.   What do the experts say?  Many experts believe that maintaining or building a small emergency fund is crucial even if you have debt. SaverLife’s Financial Coach Saundra Davis agrees. She says many people ask her, “Should I save or pay down my debt?” Her recommendation is  a balanced approach . Focus on paying down debt, but don’t eliminate saving entirely. "} 
{"prompt":"How to Teach Your Kids About Budgeting for Special Events and Purchases","completion":" Hooray to anyone willing to teach their children about budgeting for special events!  Successful money managers don’t become that way overnight. It’s a skill that needs to be taught and practiced from an early age. By teaching our children while they are under the safety of our roof, we can guide them through mistakes and help them learn.  Money management principles are the same at any age. The best way to teach children is to keep things at their level of understanding and make it fun.   Start With a Goal  Talk to your child and help them determine how much they need for the special event or purchase. Do some research with them. Spending time and discussing options can be fun. Talking about different ways to achieve the same result can build a skill that will be very useful later on in their life.    Take the goal of saving for a Disney trip or for a Mickey Mouse doll. Do some research online with your child. Discuss the difference in price for the different sizes of dolls. They may decide to go with a smaller, less expensive version once they see how expensive the larger dolls are. At a minimum, this research will help your child determine how much they need to save to get what they want.  Build the Plan  You will need to teach your children that slow and steady will win the race.  Take the amount of money needed and divide it by the number of allowances the child will receive over the time they’ll be saving. Tell them that is the amount of money they need to put away each time. They can keep it in a bank account, a jar, or an envelope. Just make sure they keep it separate from their spending money. One fun idea is to draw a thermometer and track the savings by coloring in the savings as it grows. Keep it on the refrigerator or the wall in your child’s room. This visual will help them see the progress and keep them motivated.  Be Encouraging  We all know that saving can become tedious. This is even true for adults, so children will need a lot of encouragement. When they start to waiver, remind them of the goal they set and help them to envision that final day when they reach the goal and have the money they want for the special event or purchase. A simple reminder that every candy bar they don’t buy will move them closer to getting what they really want can do the trick.    On the other hand, sometimes we have to allow our children to learn from their mistakes. This is the hardest thing to do as a parent. We want to rescue our children when they are hurting. But, if we teach our children at an early age, with the little things, that they have choices and will suffer the consequences of those choices, we can save them from making the big mistakes in adulthood.  Celebrate Success!  Once your child has reached the goal, celebrate! Put on some music and dance around the room. Post their success on social media (if they’re comfortable with it). This is a huge deal and should be treated as such. This will also reinforce the actions they took to get to this achievement which will encourage them the next time they have a financial goal.  For more information about teaching kids, Dave Ramsey has a series of children’s books that teach money management principles. Junior learns about work, saving, spending, and giving. All are excellent books to read to or with your children. "} 
{"prompt":"How Can People on Government Assistance Save for Retirement?","completion":"“Where are the best places for people on state assistance to start saving for retirement? I’m looking for something with low starting balances and low monthly transfers to the account. Do you recommend any financial companies, savings accounts, government-issue bonds, stock market?? I am so confused!”  Submitted by Jessica L.  I want to acknowledge your foresight in thinking about retirement savings. One of the challenges you are facing is the “asset means test,” which can be a barrier to receiving public benefits if you have savings that exceed the eligibility threshold.  Start with Small Savings  Your first instinct is right on. Begin saving small amounts in an account that is liquid in case you have a financial emergency. I call this a “save/don’t spend” account. If you are on state assistance, investing in the stock market may be more of a risk than is appropriate. I suggest first making sure that your daily living expenses and emergency savings are fully covered.  Some states are building “Secure Choice” retirement accounts specifically for low- and moderate-income residents. The  Pew Charitable Trusts  offers a deeper dive into this topic.  Steps For Building Savings  So what now? Here are a few things to keep in mind:   Focus on your current financial situation. Make sure you have a budget that is working for you and you are able to stick to it consistently. Identify any money available for savings.  Save small amounts every month in an account that is accessible. You can use this money as your emergency fund and it can become the “base” of your retirement fund. Make sure you stay under the eligibility threshold as long as the state assistance is necessary for your financial stability.  Remember that any assets that are held in your name are subject to review by the state. Some assets are excluded and will not impact your benefits. Cash savings and investments are often subject to the asset limits.  Stay on top of local efforts to remove asset limits or state retirement programs.  Contact a  financial coach or counselor  if you need additional help.   Learn Your Local Eligibility Rules  The savings limits vary from state to state. Check your local community to make sure you’re following the eligibility guidelines. There are efforts around the country to remove this savings barrier for people who are attempting to build financial security. However, the reality is that you should be thoughtful about saving if you need the benefits for your current living expenses. "}

{"prompt":"How to Track Your Tax Refund","completion":" It’s only natural to want to know the status of your tax refund. Is it being worked on? When will your refund reach your checking account? When will your refund check arrive? Many people rely on a tax professional or tax software to get this information. But you can also go straight to the IRS!  How Long Does It Take to Get My Refund?  Before we talk about that, let’s talk about how long a refund typically takes. The IRS says that most refunds are received within 21 days for electronic tax filings. In some cases, it can take longer. If the IRS needs more information or flags your return to ensure that you are the valid taxpayer, this process can be delayed. In both of these cases, the IRS will send you a letter letting you know what else they need.  Mailed-in tax returns typically takes 6 to 8 weeks to process. Amended tax returns (ones that you change or correct) can take up to 16 weeks to process. For 2019 amendments, the IRS started to allow electronic filing of amendments, but it can still take up to 16 weeks even if filed electronically.  What Else Can Cause My Tax Return to Be Delayed?  The most common delay is for those that receive the  Earned Income Tax Credit  or the Additional Child Tax Credit. Tax returns with these credits are put on hold until February 15th. The reason for this delay is concerns over fraud – not by you, but by criminals. Let’s say a criminal files a tax return before you and claims your children as dependents. Since the IRS holds the return, it gives you more time to try to file yours, realize someone else has claimed your children, and inform the IRS what has happened. This process helps the IRS ensure that the tax refund is going to the right person. If you claim either or both of these credits, the IRS may not update the status of your refund for several days after February 15th.  How to Check the Status of Your Tax Return  Knowing all this, you can check your refund status for current filings on  IRS.gov . To get the status you will need your Social Security Number, your filing status, and the refund amount. You can also use  IRS2Go , the official IRS mobile app, to check your refund.  If you’d prefer to use a phone, you can get automated tax refund information at this number: 1-800-829-4477. And the general line for IRS questions is 1-800-829-1040. Usually calling this line when your refund status indicates that it is processing will not get you any additional information. If you submit an amended return, you can get the status on the  IRS website . Note that the IRS says it can take up to 3 weeks to show in the system.   Waiting for a tax refund can be frustrating, but I hope you can use this information to stay up to date and know when to expect your refund. "}
