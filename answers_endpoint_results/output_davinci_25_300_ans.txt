So, congratulations on breaking through the red tape. You finally have the money in your hands that you needed to pay your bills and possibly build some savings.   Whenever you have income and you want to control where your money is going, I recommend a financial plan. Set goals that are SMART: Specific Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-specific. To help achieve your smart goal(s) create a spending plan to understand what you have coming in (income) and going out (expenses).
