'3 Strategies to Stretch Your Food Dollars': I've found that it's harder than before to control our food spending. Below are a few suggestions based on what has worked in my house:  Buy Food in Bulk and Bag the Food Yourself  Consider buying food, particularly snack food, in bulk. This may be cheaper than pre-packaged food and you just need to bag the food yourself. We do this with chips and fruit like grapes. Bagging the food myself helps me control how much each person eats and helps the food last longer.  Read more about strategies to stretch your food dollars .  Stick to a Shopping Schedule  I create a weekly meal plan, including snacks, and I shop only once a week (I have a family of five, with three teens). My family knows that if they eat all of a food before my shopping day, they will have to wait until I shop again to get that item. To save time, shop online at your favorite grocery store and use the free curbside pickup to get your groceries. Curbside pickup saves time and money because I only buy what is on my list.  Create Rules for When and What Your Kids Eat  I found my kids ate out of boredom and thirst. I told my kids they must drink a glass of water and wait 30 minutes after eating before eating again. This rule helped to cut down on “boredom” eating, and our food lasts longer. I also realized that a box of cereal only lasts a day in my home

I know for many people it has been very difficult to access unemployment benefits since the CARES Act was enacted in March 2020. On top of that, the extra $600 per month payout ended July 31, 2020. So, congratulations on breaking through the red tape. You finally have the money in your hands that you needed to pay your bills and possibly build some savings.   Whenever you have income and you want to control where your money is going, I recommend a financial plan. Set goals that are SMART: Specific Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-specific. To help achieve your smart goal(s) create a spending plan to understand what you have coming in (income) and going out (expenses). Pay yourself first at least 10% of the income and put it into building emergency savings. If you have more of a surplus after meeting your financial obligations, save even more. By using this method, you can meet your current monthly obligations and save for the future.  Hopefully, you can continue this strategy once you are re-employed sometime soon. I wish you nothing but the best in the future. '" The biggest threat to your finances during a  recession  is a reduction or loss of income.
